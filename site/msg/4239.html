 We=

s are invalid, or questionable, then I turn on the RS hack rig, and "they" =
are singing "Purple" across the band, and then the scan starts again at the=
 bottom of AM with "DO NOT---QUIT----GROUP" (the --- indicate gaps with no =
broadcasts or voice fragments), I'm supposed to believe that's just my imag=
ination, that these things don't work. The fact is all these methods work, =
and they have in fact been used long before the box.   This "Researcher" I =
was arguing with yesterday no doubt thought he had me convinced, and on his=
 side. I can't go there after I get clear, coherent, meaningful messages wi=
th these other methods. I would like to keep the disaggreements friendly, a=
nd the discussions friendly, and I do consider the opposing viewpoint, but =
it just doesn't hold water in the case of these alternate radio methods. Th=
at's why no interviews, and no in person meetings--as such, I can be put in=
to a postion of sympathy with a person when I don't actually agree. It's ca=
lled lack of assertiveness, and I did in fact fail assertiveness training i=
n the community college! As soon as the meeting is over though, I'm going t=
o tell ya to bite me, and do my own thing anyway.   I think we all have to =
be very careful when critisizing someone's work here, research, or comments=
--in public. So far very little of the EVP stuff can be considered hard evi=
dence, it's all what they call anecdotal, or it's what one or more witnesse=
s experienced, but it's not repeatable--pretty much. Or you can't grab some=
one off the street, have them listen to voices and expect they'll hear it. =
  I can't say my results are anymore valid than anyone else's' but I also c=
an't accpet that anyone else's results are more valid than my own. I am an =
independent researcher, I do this work on my own, it's more like just a hob=
by. I don't sell anything, and I make nothing by endorsing other products. =
When I say the Mini Box works, and the Radio Shack hack works, that is the =
honest thing to do, it's not cuz I get a kick back, as I get nothing in ret=
urn, except to know I did the right thing.   As for this other "Researcher"=
, I don't know what to tell ya. I can only ask, give us some friggin' credi=
t! There's some good peole here, and to dismiss us, and all or our results =
is extremely insulting.  As for the possiblities of danger with this resear=
ch, I've been thinking about that. First I don't know of anyone else that h=
as had any problems directly related to box use, and or paranormal work fro=
 that matter.  It's like listening to some bible thumper swearing the devil=
 is really right there, just waiting to jump down your throat, and yet, the=
re's..... nothing. So far it's more threatening to cross the street every m=
orning (I usually walk to work).   I pretty much work by myself, I like it =
that way, and sharing what I get here. I don't wanna be TAPS, or any other =
thing. I don't care who accepts my results, I do this for myself, for my ow=
n curiosity. I'm not going to accept someone else's version of reality, and=
 I trust my own intuition.  I'm sorry if someone thought I implied this shi=
t came from  Edison, or anyone else. I don't recall that. It's more likely =
that someone suggested it was Edison's concept, or whatever, and I kinda ag=
reed it was like that for discussion--I don't know.  I know how it came abo=
ut in my own mind, as problems are often solved, your own subconcius mind w=
ill assemble an answer based on previous experience, and I had worked with =
voltage tunable radios in the mid 90's, then I got interested in EVP, then =
I used EVPmaker, then my own mind connected all the dots, nothing mysteriou=
