I isolated the vinnie part and slowed it down and still heard "Help Vinnie help(or hello)"...weird how all our ears sometimes hear the same things and sometimes its so very different....makes me wonder what people would hear if we didnt post descriptions with our files....hmmm...I may do that with my next session...if I can ever peel the b/f off my back side for 10 mins to get in a session LOL
