A rough example would be if it found &quot;Howdy \n        Neighbo=\r\nr&quot; in a file 20 times, it could replace all the occurances with \n        sa=\r\ny $HN1.&nbsp; And also write a little dictionary in there someplace \n      =\r\n  that says &quot;$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the file gets to its \n    =\r\n    destination it can be uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are \n   =\r\n     replaced with &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot;.&nbsp; So it was compressed (instead of=\r\n \n        14 characters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionary), but l=\r\nost no \n        data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not lossl=\r\ness.&nbsp; \n        Depending on the level of compression, some level of da=\r\nta is lost, and \n        so cannot be recovered or reconstructed \n        l=\r\nater.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rick&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Sun, 5/10/09, April \n        Abe=\r\nrcrombie \n        &lt;i&gt;&lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Imagine taking a pic=\r\nture of a field of \n                  flowers, and beginning to add levels =\r\nor pixelization to the \n                  picture.&nbsp; Soon, you would no=\r\nt be able to tell there were \n                  flowers there at all.&nbsp;=\r\n You would see a lot of colored \n                  blocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or in the=\r\n other direction, imagine you are \n                  looking at a competely=\r\n randomize bunch of pixes on your \n                  screen: a complete scr=\r\neen of truely random static snow.&nbsp; \n                  Pixelizing this,=\r\n after a while, you would again start to see \n                  colored blo=\r\ncks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What&#39;s happening is that it is \n                  processing an=\r\n area of the image, taking (for instance) the \n                  average va=\r\nlue of that entire area, and replacing all the \n                  blocks in=\r\n that area with the average.&nbsp; In video \n                  processing, =\r\nthis would result in a field of multi-colored \n                  flowers be=\r\ning replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish \n                  bloc=\r\nk, with no resemblance to flowers.&nbsp; In the noise \n                  ex=\r\nample, it maybe replace all the random pixels with another \n               =\r\n   big greyish-bluish block.&nbsp; If you did not know beforehand \n        =\r\n          what the original picture was, you couldn&#39;t tell whether your \n  =\r\n                pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, the=\r\n \n                  sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It=\r\n works \n                  the same with the sound files.&nbsp; Taking somet=\r\nhing as \n                  complex as speech, and replacing frequencies wit=\r\nh their \n                  averages, loses the speech the farther you go, u=\r\nntil you head \n                  strange fluctuating square waves.&nbsp; Do=\r\ning the same to \n                  random static will eventually produce th=\r\ne same thing.&nbsp; \n                  And random fluctuating square waves =\r\ncan sound a bit like \n                  speech - or at least, you could hav=\r\ne fun sharing with each \n                  other what you thing they &#39;sound=\r\n \n                  like&#39;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Sun, 5/10/09, M=\r\nisty \n                  Dawn &lt;i&gt;&lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
