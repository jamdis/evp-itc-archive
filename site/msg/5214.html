Ron,
 
I have not heard of any voice recognition systems that would enable=
 you to recognise
a recorded evp from a box or traditional.
I believe the s=
imple reason being that evp's that come from any type of box we use today r=
un on the same
principle, the words are created by the entities using rando=
m bits of radio signal or pieces of radio chatter 
that is being scanned by=
 the box.
 
Traditional evp is based on the theory that the spirit leaving =
the message uses the ambient energy in the surrounding area
and manipulates=
 it into words that are captured by the recorder.
 
both of these methods a=
re very monotone is essence the box replies are made up of different word f=
ragments and not fluid enough.
The traditional evp message sounds very whis=
pered or pitchy and is filled with white noise and recorder static.
 
The v=
oice recognition software being used today is like misty said very expensiv=
e and is designed to recognise the inflections in human speech
it is mainly=
 used by forensic labs to determine if two speech patterns are the same.
 
=
My opinion is that the software would not be capable of detecting evp messa=
ges, I have not personally tried it but had the idea many moons ago
and res=
earched the possibility.

 Re: [EVP-ITC] Voice Recognition techniques





Theres some great software=
 out there. Problem is the really good ones have big price tags. Id have to=
 use them before I could comment on them. Clear Voice Denoiser works pretty=
 well for me and what I do. Ive been using it almost from the start along w=
ith the p1 filter for all my water sessions. It's become part of my standar=
d practice. The p1 helps bring the voices out without destroying the other =
noise.. or it can destroy most of the noise, its up to you and your setting=
s. Clear voice free demo works on all clips under 30 seconds which is fine =
for most evp work. I liked the program enough I bought it to support thier =
work. 
 
Heres one from last night, may hear her maybe not. LOL but at leas=
t ya can see the before and after results of filtered or unfiltered and how=
 CV raises the voice level. It works especially well for the -74 speed voic=
es, gives them a giant boost in tone levels. Not so whispery.
 
This one is=
 just normal speed, as recorded.
