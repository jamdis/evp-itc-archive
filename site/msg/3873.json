It&#39;s nerve wracking, and making me nuts. I don&#39;t know what \nis the correct use, function, or output of the box, I know only how I \nuse it. I get what most others get, and more. What everyoe else does \nwiht it is up to them. The box is an ITC devcie, my orignal use was \nto use for my own communications. It seemed rel;ated to EVP, so i \nshared my results on various EVP web sites, and groups. I regret \nthat, I  wish I would have kept it to myself. Humanity doesn&#39;t even \nunderstand their own minds, and yet they want to comunicate with the \nhigher realms. The other uses, such as spirit communcation, I tend to \nstay away from, it&#39;s too unpredeictable, and you can&#39;t tell who/what \nis talking. Personally I think 90% is your own minds talking back to \nyou, and giving what is expected.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I&#39;ve reached a point where I&#39;ve had enough public interaction. \nEveryone wnat to beat up Moon, yet everyone wants to do the same \nfriggin&#39; things, and I&#39;m stuck in the middle.  I don&#39;t vcare about \ndemons, bad guys, or saints coming through, I have my own group that \ncomes through, and that&#39;s what the box was made for. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; You keep typing, we keep giving.
