I think the positive energy they also produce as a way of coming through.  I just recently heard Steve&#39;s voice and laugh during an afternoon session and when asked if he in fact was also conducting a session at that time stated he was not.  I am wondering if we too leave a voice impression, such as they do with conventional EVP?
