<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Some police departments use their own series of codes that aren&#x27;t published
anywhere and aren&#x27;t used by others. And the &quot;signal&quot; seven may have a
different meaning than the &quot;code&quot; seven. It could be so widely used that the
police officers all understand what is meant by the context.
As I said, in the case of ICS/NIMS systems, the use of any of these is
discouraged.

&gt;    Yeah I have had that a few times over the years. They usually use it as
&gt; the &quot;name&quot; for the entities speaking.
&gt;
&gt; I asked another trooper tonight when I had a chance she said that yes
&gt; &quot;signal&quot; seven means a death. She also told me that some of the local police
&gt; departments use a different system. They also use the code 10-7 which means
&gt; out of service. Pretty interesting anyway.

&gt;   There is also a &quot;Seven&quot; that people get through the boxes, but it&#x27;s an
&gt; entity. I&#x27;ve gotten him too.

&gt;&gt; It would be pretty weird for the police to adopt a code that could be
&gt;&gt; confused between going to the doctor, or seeing someone shot.  I sure
&gt;&gt; wouldn&#x27;t want to report a Code 7, and risk a SWAT team breaking into the
&gt;&gt; dentist just when the drill was going into my mouth.

&gt;&gt;     Yep thats what I saw too thats why I said I&#x27;d have to question more
&gt;&gt; because what the trooper told me doesnt quite make sense to me compared to
&gt;&gt; what I found online. Maybe Aprils right I dont know until I ask. Maybe just
&gt;&gt; a nice way of asking over the airwaves.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Out of service = dead perhaps without spreading false alarm to anyone whos
&gt;&gt; listening. I have no clue. Will let ya know later why he said that.

&gt;&gt;    True - except there are other codes for fatalities, accidents, and
&gt;&gt; trauma.
&gt;&gt; Code 7 means things like home, on personal time, in court, etc.

&gt;&gt;   That would make sense as a death reference as well. Someone&#x27;s
&gt;&gt; out-of-service. .....permanently LOL!

&gt;&gt; Code 7 is either code for being out of service (short for 10-7), or a meal
&gt;&gt; break:

&gt;&gt;     Tonight at work I was talking to a state trooper, there had been an
&gt;&gt; accident. I asked him if there were any deaths (it was very very bad) and he
&gt;&gt; said he didnt know so he got on his radio and called in and asked them if it
&gt;&gt; was a 7 at the site. They told him negative, and he told me the little boy
&gt;&gt; who was the worst off was still alive. I asked him why did you ask them if
&gt;&gt; it was a 7. He said code 7, I was asking them if they were dead. So if you
&gt;&gt; ever hear anyone call 7 over the radio that means someones dead.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Just thought I would pass that on. I find it interesting since I know alot
&gt;&gt; of us have heard this before when used to describe who is speaking rather
&gt;&gt; than a name they say seven.
