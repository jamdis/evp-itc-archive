Just one\ncomment: In the file &quot;yes--to_help_you.mp3&quot;, after your question &quot;Are\nyou able to use EVPmaker throgh this&quot;, I can hear: &quot;Yes, I help ... I\nhelp you, check it out&quot;.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve personally never had succes until today with EvpMaker.  It seems \n&gt; like they&#39;re talking loud and clear with that audio clip Stefan \n&gt; posted.  I am going to do another couple minute session later and see \n&gt; what i get, the answers i feel are pretty clear.  But, i would like to \n&gt; know if others are hearing them.  I suggest for people to experiment \n&gt; with this file through EvpMaker and see what you guys get.  I&#39;m excited \n&gt; once again about the communication we are receiving.\n\n&gt; Thanx Stefan,\n&gt; -Steve H."}
