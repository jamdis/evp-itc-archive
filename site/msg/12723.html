<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>yes. i agree frank. I know that he is not coming from a totally
skeptical place with what he was saying, however, even if everything
could be totally repeatable in a lab, no evidence will ever be good
enough. Everyone called Marconi &quot;crazy&quot; when he was down in marconi
meadows, a part of city park in New Orleans, but radio was still born.

I say let them call us crazy and say what they want to. They will do
it anyways. We know the results that we are getting. If the world
doesn&#x27;t want to recognize it yet, its their problem. We will just be
laughing at them through one of your boxes that someone digs out of an
attic in 100 years from now...lol

&gt; &gt; Chris Moon and his use of Franks Box gets slammed
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Last night on Coast to Coast AM George Noory had Dr. Stephen Rorke
&gt; &gt; on-air. He discussed the field of instrumental transcommunication
&gt; &gt; (ITC), his study of the Spiricom case, Frank&#x27;s Box, and EVP 
&gt; capture.
&gt; &gt; It was during his discussion of Frank&#x27;s Box where he brought up 
&gt; the name
&gt; &gt; Chris Moon. He also brought up exactly what he thought of Chris 
&gt; Moon&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; use of the Franks Box he calls his telephone to the dead.
&gt; &gt; Better than writng about it, I&#x27;ve placed a link to the audio from 
&gt; last
&gt; &gt; night, at my post below.
