So I will just approcah it from my angle and say that if there is an energy/entity that resides in your home it will communicate when it wants to and only then. Earthbounders who attach themselves more physically to this realm so as to move or manipulate objects often hang around for thier own reasons.\n   \n  As for evp, you can pretty much get that anytime and anywhere as long as YOUR vibration is right. Frank&#39;s right background sound can help alot as far as the loudness and clarity goes it really can give it a boost to another level. Amy is also right...in your home you should attempt shutting everything down if you want to communicate with the earthbound residing there. Often they use energy from this plane of existence so you may notice the batteries drain quickly on your equiptment. If you have anything on make it something white noise like Frank suggested. I prefer water being pumped thru the fish tank filter as my background sound. They are much louder and clearer than when I use silence. They even request its on and that other things such as the air conditioner (space heater) etcetera are off.\n   \n  When you are able to sustain communications they will begin to offer advice or suggestions on how you can improve quality that night or in the future.\n   \n  I look at evp not so much as a &quot;proof&quot; but more of a highway of communication, much as radio waves, tv waves etcetera except that they tap into and operate within an unseen realm on a much different frequency level. \n   \n  One more peice of advice, if my first evp hadnt been extremely loud so that I could hear it without doing anything to it I never would have known evp was real and could happen anywhere. I have become so set in my system and setup that the file I record follows a process of analyzing it in depth following parameters that &quot;they&quot;suggested or that I learned from other researchers so now all the energy isnt wasted on one or two words that I hear in &quot;real time&quot;.\n   \n  Often I record and the &quot;real time&quot; playback holds nothing meanwhile the in depth reveals 3-20 sentences and phrases that can be heard loud and clear. On rare occasion the real time playback holds the message and there is nothing further to be found. They said it has to do with the frequency of whoever is speaking and my vibration/frequency.\n   \n  So good luck with your recording and if all else fails use a fan, run the faucet, get a fish tank and record the water sounds... or try out evpmaker for background sound.\n   \n  Misty\n   \n  LON3_S7AR &lt;lon3_s7ar@...&gt; wrote:\n          ive been out on hunts, the best advice i can give is this, shut down everything in your house, the heat/air etc tv&#39;s.
