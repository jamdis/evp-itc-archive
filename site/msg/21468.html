&gt; Heard it clearly, plus many, many other people talking, some asking you to &quot;pray for us.&quot; JC won&#x27;t let them in unless someone from the Earth prays for them.  When we ask Him, it&#x27;s then that he will allow them to get into the line, otherwise they are stuck in one stop in total darkness, can&#x27;t even see themselves or any one else for that matter, all they hear are other voices from other around them.  They are all naked too, but when they get into the light, they get &quot;spirit robes&quot; then get to meet up with loved ones again etc..He only lets them enter when they &quot;repent&quot; ask forgiveness, or sincerely say they are sorry for what they did while on Earth.  Then they start making things up, by working for others over there, doing work to correct things, some are servants, others just go into a prison for awhile, but at least it is in the light now, and they will get help.   I know, another recap but this is a great file too Frank, good job! sf
