Great interview!  I just want to thank you for getting the word out so that we can all continue our journey into the unknown.

          Hey.. it was my honor and pleasure to have our very own Bruce Halliday 
on my Ghost to Ghost PM internet radio show tonight.
Bruce has helped many of us here, and was kind enough to give me 2 
hours of his time. You can hear that show here:
http://www.ghosttoghostpm.com
It will begin playing automatically once you are on the website.

Thanks...
- Mike
