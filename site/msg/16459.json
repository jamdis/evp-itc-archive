{"id": "16459", "subject": "Finally uploaded a file!", "author": "Jill", "timestamp": "2010-01-01T04:28:49Z", "full_text": "So I finally got some motivation and figured out how to get a file from my cassette tape to the computer.  It&#39;s in the &quot;Files&quot; area here (hopefully I did everything correctly and according to protocol):\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jill%27s%20Ghost%20Box%20Files/\n\nI cleaned it up somewhat in Audacity, taking out all the extra radio snippets, so what&#39;s left is me asking for someone to say my niece&#39;s name, and then the four &quot;Katies&quot; that came after that.  There&#39;s even, I think, a fifth Katie tucked in there while I&#39;m asking, as well as the obligatory &quot;I love you&quot; first thing after I&#39;ve finished asking.  \n\nSome background:  Got my niece and cousin to do a session with me today.  Cousin has been dragging her feet, is skeptical, and the niece just arrived from out of town, is more openminded.  I&#39;m pleased we got someone to say her name four times in a row, and I&#39;m uploading it here so she can hear it back home.  So this isn&#39;t the best file I have.  Maybe now that I know how to upload (if it worked), I can upload some of my better session happenings!"}
