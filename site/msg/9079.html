<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve.  I think being a physical part of the process is what draws me to manual radio 
sweep, and what made me try SS2 with the allophones.  I think our unconscious decisions 
about how fast or slow to move the dial/slider, and when to change directions, can help 
improve communication.  But that&#x27;s just been my experience.  I know some others do not 
feel the same.  

I will say I find it&#x27;s a little easier to listen realtime to the responses when I&#x27;m not manually 
sweeping, as that can be a bit like jumping up and down on one foot while patting my 
head with one hand and rubbing my tummy with the other!  LOL.

&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s fascinating to me.  I was just sweeping randomly by feel, 
&gt; maybe the user has to be a part of the evp experience.

&gt; &gt; Steve,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How where you manipulating the slide bar in sound soap?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Was it progressive fom on end to the other, Was it jumping around 
&gt; &gt; randomly?
&gt; &gt; Please explain, I want to test it out tomorrow. FYI jeffersons 
&gt; terms 
&gt; &gt; where 1801 to 1809.
