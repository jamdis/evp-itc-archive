It&#39;s an attempt to make a \nportable EVPmaker like device. I use all methods, but just when the \nwhim hits. Last night seemed like a good time to use the RS radio. \nThere&#39;s times when one method or another doesn&#39;t work, so I switch to \nsomething else.\n\n Frank-S \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ralph Smith&quot; &lt;Ralphsmi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Frank,\n&gt; \n&gt;  How did you make out with the 12-470 Frank ? I have that one and I \n&gt; don&#39;t get much on it. I do better with the old 12-469 and the 20-\n125 \n&gt; from Radio Shack. Have a good one Frank. Oh by the way what is a \n&gt; Speaker jet I think you people were talking about it? Thanks.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Ralph the Ghost Hunter\n&gt; S.P.I.R.I.T.
