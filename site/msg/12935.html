Greetings fellow researchers,

If you're lucky enough to own a 'hacked' ol=
der Radio Shack 12-470, you
may be in for a surprise after the TV signals g=
o from analog to digital.
The current TV band audio is currently being broa=
dcast in analog format.
The 12-470 has a TV audio band segment, which now w=
hen hacked sweeps the
TV audio in your area.
After the stations stop broadc=
asting their analog signals, 12-470 owners
may have an additional opportuni=
ty to be able to sweep the following
frequencies, with no interference from=
 those high powered signals.

Channel - Audio Frequency
2 - 59.75 MHz
3 - 6=
5.75 MHz
4 - 71.75 MHz
5 - 81.75 MHz
6 - 87.75 MHz
7 - 179.75 MHz
8 - 185.7=
5 MHz
9 - 191.75 MHz
10 - 197.75 MHz
11 - 203.75 MHz
12 - 209.75 MHz
13 - 2=
15.75 MHz

Who knows what type of signals we may be able to hear when these=

frequencies are open and clear. This could also provide an opportunity
to =
produce some additional experimental devices for that region of the
band. S=
ome good ghost box type experiments!

And as an added bonus... for those in=
terested in ITC video, just think
of the opportunities that will be availab=
le for you when all those TV
channels have no signal. That too opens up a w=
ealth of possibilities.
Lots of available white noise and empty video patte=
rns for ITC research
on more unused channels, without having the worry of a=
djacent channel
interference.

Ahh... paranormal research life will be even=
 better!
