I would like to try to address some of the themes that have been going back=
 and 
forth in this forum of late; specifically, the state of science and t=
he real explanatory
power,=A0 or lack thereof, it truly has.

Two highly re=
spected parapsychologists recently published an interesting book
called "Ha=
ndbook to the Afterlife". They are Dr. Pamela Rae Heath and Dr. Jon
Klimo. =
(Frank don't even THINK of hitting the Reply button quite yet.) In this boo=
k,
they have distilled hundreds of channeled messages from many centuries i=
n an
attempt to present a comprehensive mixture of what these message might=
 tell
us about the nature of death and the afterlife. Heath and Klimo clear=
ly state that 
this book is not for everyone. It is for those who find the =
topic interesting and 
wonder what has been learned from such=A0 communicat=
ions. Clearly those who 
doubt such communications are possible or who disb=
elieve in the concept of 
afterlife probably will have no use for this book=
.

Here are two well-known scientists (in the Parapsychology community) who=

acknoweldge that sometimes it is more important to suggest what might be
p=
ossible than to stand only on that which is empirically proveable. The very=

nature of science is to explain where possible and to recognize that quite=

often the right answer to many questions is "I don't know."

Dr. Julie Bei=
schel and Dr. Gary Schwartz have conducted extensive research
into mediumsh=
ip. What that research has demonstrated is that there are 
people who can k=
now things they should not with no known ways of this 
happening. This is c=
alled 'anomalous information reception' in Parapsychology.
The point is tha=
t we know this anomalous ability exists. What we do not 
know, from the Sci=
ence, is whether discarnate entities are communicating.
Certainly the resea=
rch mediums involved believe so, such is the nature of
their compelling exp=
eriences. But the Science cannot, to date, support
the claim. And that is w=
hat is critical to understand here.

At the same time, it is important to r=
ecognize that using technology does
not necessarily imply the Scientific Me=
thod nor does is mean one is doing 
Science. What it does mean is that a pa=
rt of the experience is documented
and that might be useful at some future =
time when Science does have the 
tools and understanding to further evaluat=
e the documents. Today this is, 
unfortunately, simply not true.

What is k=
nown is that people are recording audio and video and believe 
they have ca=
ptured anomalies. Many people think these represent voices
of spirits and l=
oved ones. Unfortuantely the pure truth is that Science is 
simply not in a=
 position to validate this at this time. But that does not 
mean anyone sho=
uld stop, nor that anyone should feel they have no reason
to guess what mig=
ht be going on, or to speculate about the phenomena.

It also means that cy=
nics and skeptics who demand proof are going to
have a hard time finding it=
. If Science is not yet able to describe what it
is that is going on, skept=
ics and cynics have no way to determine what 
is absolute proof. They can h=
owever choose to accept some personal 
variant of their own truth as accept=
able proof should they so desire.
But this is not empirical proof as requir=
ed by Science.

Dr. Donald Hoffman is an expert on visual perception and is=
 one of 
the authors of "Conscious Realism" - a scientific theory of realit=
y
which is the first to solve the mind/body problem. Dr. Hoffman is one
sci=
entist who completely understands how people misperceive things,
and yet hi=
s controversial theories challenge even some of the world's 
leading theore=
tical physicists when it comes to understanding. Clearly
there are scientis=
ts who appreciate this phenomena may well be real.
I have personal dialogs =
with them frequently. You would simply not
believe how frustrating it is fo=
r someone whose job it is to explain 
the world to others to have no idea w=
hatsoever what might be going
on here.

I hope this helps put a face on Sci=
ence, and that I have succintly
but=A0 clearly explained why Science offers=
 no magic explanations
at this time. And at the same time, perhaps this wil=
l better set
expectations for everyone while recognizing that the work bein=
g 
done here may well have potential merit in the due course of time.
