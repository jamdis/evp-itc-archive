my 469 chose me and was the right price, but i also bought the 125, and i didn't like it at all.  My 469 is for me.

Do not give in to these demons that are trying to make a buck from the research we love and the equipment we use.
 
I have given away including the shipping 5 RS boxes for free, 4, 470's and 1 469 all hacked by me.
I did not do it to gain popularity or even wanted a thank you. my sole motivation was to bring new people into the research and 
in turn change someones life and perpetuate the idea of strength in numbers, in this case strength of communication.
 
To all new people on this board, do not patronise these wolves that prey on the needs and wants of others. 
The RS 20 -125 is everything the 470 & 469 are and a little more. do not let the size or complicated button arrangement scare you off.
the hack is as simple as the others. 
 
Do not buy any RS hacks from ebay, they are sold with the wrong energy attached to them, spirit wise.
That is why I and all other researchers should follow the example of a great man to whom we owe all of this research.
Mr. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to make a substantial amount of money from his boxes and
was offered the opportunity on a silver platter. But chose to follow what had been asked of him by higher entities.
And that was to keep the research pure for research sake. And that at no time was this equipment or knowledge there of
to be for monetary gain.
 
I adhere to this promise made by Frank to our friends on the other side and feel that there is no need to give in to these box 
extortionists. If a box is not attainable for a new person yet, the right way. Then it probably is not their time yet.
 
I have coined a phrase and believe in it. "The researcher does not choose the box, the box chooses the researcher"
Be patient, those that do not yet have a box. We will do all we can to help you obtain one.

        No bodies at fault, but I would do the hack just to help more people get in this field.  As Bruce sayes the more people the better comunication we will have.

Well, all I can say is the market is driven by BUYERS. If people are willing to pay, you can't 
fault the person selling for taking advantage of what the market will bear. Perhaps the 
people who do not have the tools, or the skills, to do their own hack, feel this price is 
reasonable?
