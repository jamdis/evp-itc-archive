I&#39;m using a RS hack 12-469 for raw audio and recorded white\nand pink noise on an analogue recorder. Rather than go with a sound\nchamber to mix the raw audio and white/pink noise I ran both to the\nsame set of speakers. I&#39;ll post a pic of the system. My question is,\nhave I handicapped the system by doing this? I have seen some people\nrecord raw audio and add white noise later with Audacity. I really\ndon&#39;t see a whole lot of difference myself."}
