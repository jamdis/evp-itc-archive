This will be number 7! The 7th time per messages from Maggy's contacts in t=
he 90's. The message went as such: 



=93In the course of bygone
decades, =
of thousands of earthly years, beings interested in the human species
meet =
to decide on the continuation of the project. You must not imagine that
onl=
y The Seven implicated in the actual development of INIT are there. No, it
=
is a coming together of all entities interested in mankind. 


 


        =
   =93The interests are various. 


 


           =93We, The Seven of the =
Rainbow
People, have decided to help and support the way chosen by you, in =
INIT. It is
the way of morals, which means to understand, to acknowledge, t=
o devise, and to
act. It is not to be mixed up with religion, which means t=
o believe. However,
the two can be complementary. But they are independent =
one from the other.


 


=93You already know that also
Pharisees ghouls, s=
windlers, thieves=97yes, even murderers=97have their interested
supporters =
here among the dead. And the term =93higher being"=97notice that we
never=
=97does not stand, as it is often misinterpreted by falsely religious peopl=
e
to be purified, rid of all sin, whatever the word =93sin=94 means for the=
m. There
are also entities here interested in THAT situation.


 


       =
    =93This is the seventh time that we
accompany and guide you on your pro=
gress toward a free, wealthy and sane future
in which humanity would have s=
tripped off the chains of intolerance and
cruelty=97a future in which it wi=
ll be able to establish a fruitful, endurable
relationship with the Light, =
ethereal realms of existence.=94 


 


=93Our and your opponents tried to
=
prevent this by all means. Your meeting in Tarrytown is a decisive one=97me=
n and
women of wit whittle out together to make true the dream of a strong
=
international association based on morals and on ethics, not only by giving=
 it
a fundamental constitution and sheltering it this way from the wind, th=
e rain,
and the storms of pernicious attacks, but also by strengthening lov=
e and
friendship true, the best qualities of mankind. 


 


=93The first s=
tep was made in
Dartington. (In recent) weeks, some of your best were cruel=
ly hit by illnesses,
diseases, and personal problems in order to keep them =
away from their valuable
work. Be assured, even if we cannot avoid the plag=
ue, we can control the
gravity. Whatever has happened, do not lose courage.=
 We are there. You are in
the right way. You are a small number, but much d=
epends on you and your
decisions on those days. We trust in you.=94
