<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was going to stay out of this until I noticed my subscription for 
the GH group was dropped. Most of the people who joined both groups 
play no part in this war of words thats been going on and as for 
having an enemy camp...who made you the judge?

I will say the same thing I said to the owner of the other group. I 
joined both groups to study evp, I dont know what you all joined to 
accomplish but to learn more and progress were my intentions. I had 
nothing to do with any of the arguments going on. When you guys fight 
it just lowers your vibration and interferes with the work. Franks 
been told this as well as the GH group.

So if you want to continue your war of words try using private email 
and leaving the innocent people who just want to study and research 
out of your drama.

I&#x27;ve been told my unsubscription was accidental and I can rejoin. I 
may do that once the negative crap is over and done with. Unlike a 
few others I chose not to take sides. I&#x27;d rather spend my few moments 
of freetime learning and doing sessions rather than join the tongue 
lashing. You should all do the same, after all thats what the groups 
are for..... So we can discuss evp, not the &quot;days of our lives&quot;

Misty

&gt; And to anyone else who plans on staying in Frank&#x27;s enemy camp here, 
you 
&gt; are missing some other really good lists.
