      This will take place =
on Nov 12=3D14, 2010 in Oshkosh Wisconsin. We are putting together our sche=
dule of speakers and I would really like to add at least one speaker who ca=

close enough and interested in doing this? 



We can't pay much if anythin=

tever. We expect to have a large attendance. We will also be blocking out r=
ooms in the convention center hotel nearby and will be able to get reduced =
rates.
