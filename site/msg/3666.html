<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Frank,

Have you had much success in addressing things with C2C folks?

I&#x27;m a C2C Streamlink member and would love to hear them interview 
you. I had a lot of misconceptions due to what some have attributed 
to you in the past, specifically regarding your device being 
something Jesus personally approved. 

Don&#x27;t get me wrong though. As a Vice President of the board of a 
Unity church, I consider Jesus to be a friend and way shower. I&#x27;m 
sure glad to see you&#x27;re a serious research engineer. It&#x27;s painfully 
obvious that some folks are all about steering these efforts to their 
own ends by pushing the religous angle.

Keep the great work moving ahead!
Lance

like us to believe.

&gt; I wrote to all the c2c people this morning about the 12-469 and 12-
470. I wrote to George, Art, Ian, and Rollye James. Only Rollye James 
wrote back so far thanking me for the information. That was nice of 
her!- Mike--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;judy_in_hollywood&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Colleagues,Thank you for your concern. Events that 
unfolded early this morning have prompted me to effectively close the 
Ghostboxhacks site for the near term. Do to the nature of these 
events it is inappropriate to discuss the matter in a public form 
such as this. Please do not speculate on the nature of this event. I 
am sorry, after talking to council I removed my statement from 
Ghostboxhacks.I don&#x27;t want to fuel wild speculation. I wish I could 
go in to greater detail, at this time I have been advised not 
to.Thank you, Everyone for your emails and concern.-Sum&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The

= Hi Frank &amp; All, Well, we ALL could email C2C&#x27;s George Noorey and 
tell him about the RS 12-469 Am/FM radio hacks and how to work 
it . . . . IF he mentions it on the show, IMAGINE, the results! Plus, 
RS would possibly get sold out of those radios. Kinda like the now 
discontinued Panasonic RR DR-60 IC recorder + potentially increase in 
value! Why not even post a Modified RS 12-469 on EBAY and see what 
happens!? Let&#x27;s advertise what we&#x27;ve discovered, here! =Judy=&gt;
