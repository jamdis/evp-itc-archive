I see what you're getting at there.=C2=A0 I'll have to see if I can come up=
 with something like that without risking 'cheats' - for example, someone c=
alling a friend in the area to go look.

      RJ, if you live in or near a large cit=

ere it won't be noticed right away, and can be erased easily after the cont=
est?  That way, any spirits could locate the building, post, bridge, or wha=
tever, and see if they can see the chalk number or other symbol?  This migh=
t make it easier than trying to locate your home, with only an internet nic=
kname to go by.  Just a thought.
