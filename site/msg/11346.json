It shouldn&#39;t be difficult to solder a diode, 2 resistors and 2 capacitors into a plug and test it. The schematic is here: http://www.worlditc.org/c_04_s_bridge_10.htm\n\nBTW, can anyone recommend a (tested) schematic for a simple random bit generator that can be connected to the LPT port? It should be able to deliver about 10,000 random bits (TTL level) per second. I&#39;d like to add an option for connecting an external &#39;hardware&#39; random number generator to EVPmaker.\n\nStefan\n\nP.S.: A new EVPmaker version is available for download on my website:\nhttp://www.stefanbion.de/evpmaker/\nIt has some additions as for instance 2 new random sources (Internet and &quot;manual sweep&quot;), and a new &quot;live audio source&quot; mode.\n\n--\n\nBetreff: [EVP-ITC] Re: Crystal radio technique\nGesendet: Mo, 23.

Any other ideas regarding crystal radio anyone.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Ray,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have recently built a Raudive detector into a metal 1/8 inch phone\n&gt; jack for a friend, using surface mount coil and 1/8 watt resistor with\n&gt; a regular crystal diode. This is basically an untuned crystal radio\n&gt; and detects all radio signals at the same time.\n&gt; \n&gt; I didn&#39;t get anything but noise for the short time I had it...but my\n&gt; friend is happy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Joe"}
