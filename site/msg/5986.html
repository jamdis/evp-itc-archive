<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Guys, 
       I just posted several files from a joint session this weekend in 
Kentucky.  I would appreciate the imput from those who are serious 
about the research here.  Many of the serious researchers have spent 
years, and countless hours a day testing these lines of communication.  
I for one refuse to allow the negitive get to me and will continue to 
work either independently or with my fellow colleages who truly respect 
each other and their contributions in this area.

        So with that being said, I hope you enjoy the audio clips.  
They are from a Joe&#x27;s Box session.

        In addition, I have introduced several new researchers to the 
RS hacked in hopes that their their future studies will add in our up 
hill climb in pursuing what we started.

Thanks!
Juli</pre>
