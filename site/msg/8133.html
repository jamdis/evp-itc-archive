&gt;   Here is a good crystal for spirit communication. Even though you 
don&#x27;t seem to have a bit of trouble with that........
&gt;    
&gt;   Apophyllite has been used to create a conscious connection 
between the physical form and the spiritual realm. It facilitates 
attunement to ones body as well as to the higher dimensional life 
forms. ... It has been used to facilitate astral travel.... Allows 
one to see into the future...the pyramids can be used to stimulate 
one&#x27;s intuitive vision.

{  FONT-SIZE: 10pt;  FONT-FAMILY:Tahoma  }     From the 20th. I get 
the impression, not necessarily from this group, that some think 
because I don&#x27;t ask questions that the information is uselss. I think 
that&#x27;s presumptuous and self centered. This is that LA1135 radio. The 
voices seem clearer with this box, I&#x27;m not sure why. This is the same 
chip in many of the car AM tuners. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I wanted to go to the metaphysical fair last weekend to get 
crystals, but ended up working, so I&#x27;ll have to go to the mineral 
store.
