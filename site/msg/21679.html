&gt; Well, the point of it really is that manual sweep does work, even with this old radio. My hubby was a little reluctant to let me use it, but I&#x27;m cute, what can I say? As far as the speed goes, I was turning it as fast as I could, but it was a little tight. I guess it needs some WD40. 
&gt; At :45 I hear &quot;Do you compute, McPhereson.&quot; and then a man answers &quot;Yes&quot; pretty clearly. I had told &quot;them&quot; that I was testing out this radio and that they should talk, so maybe they were testing it, too. Jamie

&gt; &gt; 13 seconds &quot;Get Frank Ready&quot;.  I didn&#x27;t hear much else, a little too slow for me.  I prefer a faster sweep without any words from radio stations to come through.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Found something I&#x27;d like to share. This is a video I made on May 16,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2011 of me using my late father-in-law&#x27;s old multiplex radio to get EVP
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using a manual sweep. Pretty cool stuff, if I do say so. Thanks to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank! I don&#x27;t think I would have tried this without his influence.
