We will be doing a investigation there starting \n&gt; may \n&gt; &gt; 17th.. unfortunatly no box yet. It would be a  pretty cool \nexperience \n&gt; &gt; if we had one to experiment with but lol being broke all of our \nmoney \n&gt; &gt; will be going towards the investigation\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\nits going to be a awsome experience think the biggest thanks goes to \nthe local group who invited us to come with them.."}
