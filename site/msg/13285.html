I hope this question isn't because of what I just posted..

 

I did ask m=
y teenagers (yes, lucky me, I have them, too) how it effects them. One of t=
hem is involved in the paranormal investigations and all the research, so s=
he said she thinks it is interesting and she loves it. The 15 yr old said s=
he is afraid of it and hates having to hear about it and listem to it - whi=
ch I could say about her music choices, but I don't :)

As far as my younge=
r children, 10 yr old and then 1 yr old, they just seem to accept it as par=
t of their Mom's life. I don't hold sessions with the 1 yr old around.

The=
 ten year old was at one session - at her request - at  a location, and par=
t of her liked getting validation for what had been experiencing there, but=
 another part of her was scared.

She has had many experiences with ghosts =
- some very intense - so I would  never let her attend anything until she w=
as mature enough to handle it.

I was wond=
ering if anyone had an opinion on the impact of performing
ITC experiments =
or sessions, when there are young children around. Do
you think the childre=
n seeing their parents or others (in person, not
on TV) engaging in this ac=
tivity would have an effect on the children,
and if so, do you think the ef=
fect would be positive, or negative?
