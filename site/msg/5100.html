<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve been out of town since Friday, just read thru all the  
communications that went back and forth while I was gone. Saving  
listening to the sound bytes after I get some work done this morning.

I spent my travel time reading the first Sara Estep book. Until I  
joined this group I hadn&#x27;t heard about her, but reading her book has  
made me even more determined to start research with a vengeance.

I was in St Augustine, investigating at the St A Lighthouse. While I  
was there I stopped at a couple of Radio Shacks to see if they had the  
older 469, and found out that I wasn&#x27;t the only one searching there.  
Other people who were in town for the Lighthouse investigation were  
hitting local RS stores too -- had to laugh! I did manage to bid on  
the on that was on eBay, but due to the auction cutoff time and my  
flights I missed the sale by $1.00. I was so close! Oh well, there  
will be other ways to get to where I&#x27;m going.

Frank, I did get the screws from my camera in the mail while I was  
gone -- thanks! I&#x27;m going to mail the camera off this week to Zack to  
see if he can help.

I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing the samples that everyone loaded while  
I was gone ~
