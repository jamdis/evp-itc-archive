Hi Juli, 

Congratulations on the box!!  I know you'll put it to good use a=
nd be highly rewarded.  

I'm going to listen to my radios simultaneously r=
ight now.. just listen with my eyes closed for a few minutes.  I tried doin=
g this last night but promptly fell asleep!  I have my recorder with me too=
 but think I won't turn it on right now.  I wonder if it helps to ask quest=
ions BEFORE you actually start recording.  I used to do that when trying to=
 get regular ol' EVP.

Robin

ject: [EVP-ITC] Frank's Box #12


  I am proud to announce that yesterday I=
 became the bran new owner of 
  Franks Box #12. This box was past on from =
one researcher to another 
  and upon Bruce receiving his new Frank's Box #=
29, he has willed the 
  box #12 to me for research. I have been longing fo=
r a box for 
  several years now, and know that all good things come to tho=
se who 
  wait.

  I know this is an honor and a privilege being only the s=
econd women 
  in the world to own one (that I am aware of). I am extremely=
 greatful 
  to both Bruce and Frank as well as the others on this board an=
d hope 
  that my contributions and sessions with this box can help in the =

  field with our research!

  The communication I got immediately when I t=
urned it on is truly 
  amazing (I will be adding files shortly marked box =
#12 in the file 
  section).

  I have started doing two types of sessions =
one just running the 
  recorders (like Frank does) and then a separate que=
stion and answer 
  session later during the day. I know its hard trying to=
 stop 
  yourself from asking questions, but let them have their time as we=
ll, 
  for the communication should not be one sided, us always wanting 
  =
something from them to be answered. If they want you to jump in and 
  answ=
er one of their questions, believe me they let you know (see my 
  file, le=
ts get started).

  I have come to realize that many messages are missing w=
hen you jump 
  the gun trying to start that immediate two way communicatio=
n, or you 
  start talking over them, not allowing clear audio to be receiv=
ed. 
  Therefore, I would highly suggest trying this as well, you just may =

  be surpised what you get!

  Additionally, I have also observed that whe=
n tuning in the boxes, 
  play close attention,they may just give you direc=
tions, you don't 
  have to have the conversation going. They seem to want =
that 
  communication just as bad as you do.

  It is audio clips with grea=
t communication that make all of this 
  time worth it. Knowing that in my =
heart they enjoy communicating with 
  us just as much as we do them.

  Ju=
li
