I really don&#39;t see anywhere in my post, a stance being mad=\r\ne beside my agreeing with Sumption. Since you mentioned it, I have a proble=\r\nm with people who consider themselves to be advanced researchers in ITC tel=\r\nling others that there are things you need protection from in this field. I=\r\n have seen this fear mongering over the many years I have been involved wit=\r\nh my research and the research of colleagues and associates and it has neve=\r\nr helped anyone. Are there negative entities out there that want to influen=\r\nce you and distract you? Sure there are! Probably just as many who want to =\r\nhelp you and they have been there since the beginning of each of our lives.=\r\nThe rule of thumb in dealing with those negative forces is to not follow th=\r\neir messages. If the message is basically negative then give it no merit an=\r\nd carry on. No ritual needed! Now if you want credentials I can give you my=\r\n &quot;paranormal resume&quot; and let the pissing contest begin. All you need to kno=\r\nw about me is I know enough to know that the more I learn and experience th=\r\ne more I realize I have a lot to learn. Ego you say, not at all. Best regar=\r\nds,Frank R.\n----- Original Message ----From: bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigat=\r\ning@...&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.comSent: Monday, January 14, 2008 8=\r\n:29:15 AMSubject: [EVP-ITC] For Frank R. this is long but I think worth the=\r\n read\n\nFrank,Let me say at the onset this is not meant as an attack and I w=\r\nill not get into a pissing match over it, but I did feel I needed to addres=\r\ns it.I promised myself that I would not post a response to any one person,o=\r\nnly to a subject in general, but I will have to break that promise on this =\r\none.I think your response to the ritual protection post was egotistical, ca=\r\nreless and uninformed. That was the response I would expect from a close mi=\r\nnded sceptic that had no real experience in this field.As a researcher in t=\r\nhe paranormal in general you should know that there is a very real and pres=\r\nent danger from darker entities, especially in the field of box research th=\r\nat is still in its infancy and our knowledge is not advanced enough using t=\r\nhis method to be so hap hazard about it.All are entitled to their own opini=\r\non as far as the way they go about their own research but to advise that pr=\r\notection from the negative means nothing and to do it in an open forum wher=\r\ne there are impressionable new individuals that are just entering into this=\r\n research is very careless on your part.Some researchers here including Ste=\r\nve and myself among other have recorded files with messages that tell us th=\r\nat the communication process is being hindered at that time by what we refe=\r\nr to as &quot;dark heads&quot; and our spirit contacts actually use that term. they h=\r\nave also told us when asked why communication was so bad that it was being =\r\nblocked by negative entities. I only one of a few that have gotten this exa=\r\nct communication. So there is a real threat from negative energy or entitie=\r\ns.Plus through research we have found that it is possible for entities to t=\r\nravel back and forth between our realms during an open box session. If you =\r\nlistened to numerous files Steve and I have posted asking our friends mike =\r\nand Lisa on the other side to insure that all and any spirits that may have=\r\n traveled through please go back and have gotten conformation from them eve=\r\nry time.If it is possible for an entity to travel through the portal that a=\r\n box MAY produce then it stands to reason it is possible that it can be a d=\r\nark entity.As far as fear goes, I agree wholeheartedly, fear definitely fee=\r\nds the negative. And that is my point. The protection ritual does not creat=\r\ne a relative tangible barrier, it is simply a metaphoric symbol of putting =\r\nyour mind in the right place so as not to feed this negative energy.And the=\r\n protection we receive from our tech/guides on the other side in my belief =\r\nis very real, I believe they do actually run interference for us as far as =\r\nnegativity goes and the part of the ritual where we invoke their help is ju=\r\nst a form of respect and acknowledgement that they are constantly watching =\r\nout for us.this being said, Of course everyone will adhere to their own bel=\r\niefs as far as this subject is concerned. I just felt that your response wa=\r\ns a little strong and came more from the attitude that I also suffer from t=\r\nhat is to say &quot; negative spirit yeah bring it on&quot;But that is not a logical =\r\nthought out approach to an existing concern.So make the ritual available fo=\r\nr anyone that wants to use it and the experienced information to go with it=\r\n.My most important concern is the welfare and teaching and eventual success=\r\n of new researcher and this research as a whole.Bruce\n\nNever miss a thing. =\r\nMake Yahoo your homepage. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________=\r\n_________________________\nMake distant family not so distant with Windows V=\r\nista=AE + Windows Live=99.\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/windows/digitallife/kee=\r\npintouch.mspx?ocid=3DTXT_TAGLM_CPC_VideoChat_distantfamily_012008\r\n--_3b29373a-5ab4-4573-b8f4-42b4938f95cc_\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;\n.hmmessage P\n{\nmargin:0px;\npadding:0px\n}\nbody.hmmessa=\r\nge\n{\nFONT-SIZE: 10pt;\nFONT-FAMILY:Tahoma\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body class=3D&#39;=\r\nhmmessage&#39;&gt;\nFrank,&lt;BR&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;\nOK, two old green berets like us are neve=\r\nr gonna give leeway anyway so lets just drop it.&lt;BR&gt;\nno disrespect intended=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;\nBruce&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dcenter&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D4&gt;&lt;FONT c=\r\nolor=3D#0033cc&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D5&gt;Bruce Halliday &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://free-paranormalinvestigating.c=\r\nom/%3C/div%3E%3C/div%3E%3Cp%20/%3E%3Cdiv%20class=3D&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n&lt;HR&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;F=\r\nrom: warrior18eii@...&lt;BR&gt;Date: Mon, 14 Jan 2008 07:19:39 -0800&lt;BR&gt;Sub=\r\nject: Re: [EVP-ITC] For Frank R. this is long but I think worth the read&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;Microsoft SafeHTML&quot; name=3DGenerator&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3DEC_y=\r\ngrp-mlmsg style=3D&quot;WIDTH: 655px&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3DEC_ygrp-msg style=3D&quot;PADDING-RI=\r\nGHT: 15px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; Z-INDEX: 1; FLOAT: left; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px;=\r\n WIDTH: 490px; PADDING-TOP: 0px&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3DEC_ygrp-text&gt;\n\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FO=\r\nNT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman,new york,times,serif=\r\n&quot;&gt;Bruce,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No problem, you are entitled to your perspective and opinio=\r\nn.
