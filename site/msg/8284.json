Mr 2008\nVon:  RetroCom&lt;vfp19968@...&gt;\n\n&gt; Stefan,\n&gt;  I tried your idea last night using your file and instructions and got some\n&gt; results. Most messages were two or maybe three words, only a couple were\n&gt; longer with any meaning. I&#39;ll post a few here as an example.\n&gt; &quot;Ohh Yes&quot;\n&gt; &quot;You hear the people&quot;\n&gt; &quot;The people use the test, you should tape..error&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the excellent tip, this method appears to have great potential,\n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; --- yahoogroups@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt;\n&gt; To: Misty Dawn &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] An idea: random event generator based on alphabet\n&gt; Date: Wed, 26 Mar 2008 02:39:52 +0100\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Misty, &quot;inner energy&quot;, all,\n&gt; \n&gt; maybe one could feed the SpeakJet allophones into EVPmaker. The attached\n&gt; WAV file contains the 72 allophones of the SpeakJet chip. (I used\n&gt; Audition to cut them out of the sample clip which has been posted here\n&gt; recently, and store them in a cue list.) To use this file as an EVPmaker\n&gt; source, the &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option must be checked. I have done a few short\n&gt; sessions, and got this strange message:\n&gt; \n&gt;                 &quot;I little Sir help you eclipse.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (Doesn&#39;t make any sense to me... lol)\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, this cannot replace a hardware version of SpeakJet, since\n&gt; EVPmaker isn&#39;t able to produce the proper transitions between the\n&gt; allophones. But maybe it&#39;s worth a try...\n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I used the phrase &quot;the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&quot; in\n&gt; Stefan&#39;s evpmaker and have had interesting results including some live. I\n&gt; tried other pangrams (contain every letter of english\n&gt; &gt; alphabet) but the one I felt drawn to use was the one that has had the\n&gt; best results.\n&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   No two sessions are ever alike and as background sound its easily\n&gt; modulated into quite complicated sentences and word structures.\n&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; inner energy &lt;innergy111@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;           You know, i was thinking:\n&gt; &gt; If you could build a random event generator built on the spoken\n&gt; &gt; letters of the alphabet,\n&gt; &gt; that would definately be nice and very good."}
