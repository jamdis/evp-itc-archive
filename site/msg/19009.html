<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>yes, it is digital

well like i&#x27;ve said we know not to trust the content of what they say as being true... but we can tell when something intelligent is trying to communicate, whether or not they&#x27;re trying to lie to us...

on the other hand, if they&#x27;re ghosts, they may very sincerely BELIEVE that reincarnation is not possible, for the simple fact that they are stuck as ghosts, and denied the ability to reincarnate...
makes sense in a way, no?

&gt;   
&gt; When my husband asked whether or not reincarnation is real, he was met with a 
&gt; slew of &quot;no&quot;&#x27;s. We know better than to believe anything they say one way or the 
&gt; other, but we do recognize that this is excellent proof of intelligent 
&gt; communication... how often do you scan the dial and get like five or six &quot;no&quot;&#x27;s 
&gt; this close together?
&gt;
