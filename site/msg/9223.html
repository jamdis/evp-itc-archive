<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was just looking ar the Radio Shack website because I never even 
bothered to see how much the 12-469&#x27;s are.  Only $25!

The website indicates their on-line ordering is out of stock on them, 
though. But there&#x27;s enough Radio Shacks across the country that probably 
have them.

&gt; &quot;Hi Frank, I know a lot of us were waiting for you to chime in...... I was at 2 Radio Shacks tonight and there were a lot of 12-469&#x27;s on the shelf there. If you need any just let me know. Jeff&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Mostly I was just kidding about y&#x27;all buying up all the 469s. What I like about it, is using it as a tuner in a regular box, as I have yet to been able to make an FM receiver. I wish I had the funds to buy maybe ten of the radios, but I can only get one at time past the Ol&#x27; Lady.
