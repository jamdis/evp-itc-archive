OMG

How he is still around and taken at all seriously in this field is be=
yond me.

 

I made the mistake of pag $100.00 to go to one of his conferen=
ces back in the late 90's and felt so robbed that I think I crashed the nex=
t two or three in an attempt to get some kind of value for the money he got=
 from me, but the conferences were so bad i couldn't even sit through them.=


He went  on the Maury show a while back with a bunch of EVPs that weren't=
 even his..

 

He would sell his mother if he thought he could get a price=
 for her...

 

Aside from that, this is a problem in the paranormal commun=
ity, where people charge for various training and certifications that are  =
worthless..

and other people charge hundreds of dollars for Frank's Box se=
ssions.

It is important that we educate people (the public) about free inf=
ormation so they don't get taken, BUT I still feel that any of these boxes,=
 in the hands of the wrong person, can be extremely dangerous.  When I hear=
 the negative EVPs on youtube I cringe.. In 15 years I have only gotten two=
 negative EVPs and I understand why I got them..
