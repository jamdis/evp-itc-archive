Ron,
 
And anyone that does not have experience on this subject.
EDITING D=
OES NOT MEAN SPLICE!
 
If you splice something you are either adding or cut=
ting out relevant sections to make the file say what you want it to say.
I =
don't think that is what Juli meant to convey in this post.
 
If every rese=
archer that has or does use an editing program to clean up their recordings=
 and files was to stop doing research right now
this group and all like it =
would be a GHOST TOWN ! 
 
Lets not let this thread get out of control.

Hi Juli   Questions regarding you comments:  d=

onsidered EDITING?  
 
Also, it seems to me that something like EVPmaker an=

te assignment where classic EVP's are sought or where you are sharing sessi=
ons with the public or with clients?  It also seems that sharing sessions h=
ere is quite different than making your professional services available to =
the public.  Rules can be set for this forum.  Rules cannot be set for the =
public.  Have rules or guidelines been set here?  More thoughts.  Ron Ljuli=

People, there is one thing that you have to remember. =
