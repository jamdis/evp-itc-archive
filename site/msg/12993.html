Reje=
cting
spam is absolutely your right. It is also the right of others to post=
 what they
choose as long as it is within the guidelines of the groups mode=
rator of which
you are not. 

As far as my making the distinction, the head=
line of the post was clear as to
the contents, so therefore, you chose to r=
ead it. Now if someone was there
holding you against your will until you re=
ad it, then I apologize.

Dear Jeremy,
 
The length of membership is not=
 an issue for me. Someone who is a part of this group for a longer length h=
as no more rights than a newbie. I joined EVP-ITC not IPAA.  If I read mess=
ages sent from EVP-ITC I expect stuff related to that group ONLY.  If I joi=
n IPAA and read messages sent from IPAA then I expect stuff related to that=
 group ONLY as well.
 
If the message is sent by EVP-ITC and I open it and =
it is about something else entirely under the assumption it was about EVP-I=
TC, I WAS MADE TO READ IT. I'm sorry you cannot make that distinction.
 
Th=
ere is a difference between mentioning something off handedly vs. running a=
n entire ad. I do have the right to reject spam.
 
The moderator did reply =
to me and that was sufficient. Thank you very much.
 
~Clara

The IPAA is run by people who have been members for a long time. It is pa=

Who is IPAA and why am I receiving this information with a lin=

I would prefer not to receive these kinds of invita=
tions through this group.  I usually get enough ads as it is without gettin=

Please don't make me=

Thank you.
