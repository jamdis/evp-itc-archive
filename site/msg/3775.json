Chris&#39;s box is quite\n&gt; capable of behaving like John Edward--directly bringing relations\n&gt; through to talk to those who need to hear them. Some of the \nresponses\n&gt; were astoundingly clear and loud. It certainly sounded similar to \nwhat\n&gt; I have heard of what Bruce is getting, and honestly, it is exactly\n&gt; what I hope to get with my box when I receive it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you haven&#39;t listened to this, you really should. I think Chris\n&gt; made his usual statements about Edison and the 30, but aside from\n&gt; that, this was a wonderful session and people were extremely moved.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you want, I&#39;ll find the URL.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Sent: Dec 3, 2007 12:40 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: Group &lt;evp-itc@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Maybe there is only one box user allowed!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Christopher was immediately taken by what he had seen and heard.\n&gt; He was able to &gt; make a direct connection with spirits. inhabitants,\n&gt; victims, participants, and &gt; witnesses...describing amazing events \nand\n&gt; even some unspeakable acts that had &gt; happened within the walls of\n&gt; these notoriously haunted places. The details &gt; afforded by these\n&gt; spirits gave answers to lingering questions that could not &gt; have \ncome\n&gt; from anyone but the parties involved. Already amazed by the &gt;\n&gt; instrument&#39;s ability to connect with these historical figures,\n&gt; Christopher soon &gt; realized that other entities were trying to reach\n&gt; out as well. Deceased fathers, &gt; sons, mothers, daughters, and \nfriends\n&gt; of session participants were sending &gt; messages through the device.\n&gt; Talk of this spread, and last year, at the Ghost &gt; Chaser&#39;s Weekend\n&gt; Conference in Savannah, Georgia, Christopher was asked to do a &gt;\n&gt; presentation about his research with the Telephone to the Dead. This\n&gt; quickly &gt; turned into an impromtu public demonstration, with\n&gt; participants, one by one, &gt; coming forward requesting to speak with\n&gt; loved ones who had died. Surprisingly, &gt; even to Christopher, these\n&gt; requests were met with comforting and sometimes vital &gt; messages. \nThe\n&gt; presentation was recorded and broadcasted by A.P.S.R. Radio.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From a recent add for another presentation, but apparently the\n&gt; rest of us get nothing like this, so it doesn&#39;t even work for us.\n&gt; Guess I&#39;ll just go back to killing time wth Ham radio, and quit\n&gt; wasting all my time and money on useless boxes. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Curious that no one else gets any &quot;real&quot; contacts--event the so\n&gt; called box inventor gets nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S \n&gt; &gt; &gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt;You keep typing, we keep giving.
