<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank,

To start off with no I do not want a box. =) 

However, I do have a question for you when you have time.  I was just
curious as to where you got the inspiration for the box. 

Was it just an idea that popped into your head or did you have help
from the other side?  Not to take any credit away from you at all with
your accomplishments with the box. It was just something I was curious
about.

I believe I am looking for personal answers from the other side but
also I feel it may help me with some more general directions I may
want to go in after putting my own personal demons to rest. 

Thanks for your time in advance.

Regards,
TT</pre>
