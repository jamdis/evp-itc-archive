I said this before but some of you may have missed it. For those who 
post messages to group and nothing seems to go thru. No you are not 
moderated, no you are not blocked. The yahoo groups spam filters 
sometimes view your posts as spam and make it so that a mod has to 
approve it before its posted. This is not our doing and nothing we 
can do to change it. Bruce seems to be its favorite target and Ive 
done everything short of makin him owner to try and get it to quit 
doing it. But at least once a day it chooses one of his posts and 
marks it. As well as others here who are frequent posters.

The bigger the group gets the more I see. Unfortunately for you guys 
I work and the other mods are out of town so today the posts had to 
sit in the spam box until I get home and click the approval. 

Things will run smoother when the others get back. So relax. I know 
its annoying sometimes its happened to all of us.

The only thing I have noticed is when it does mark a post as spam it 
usually is a run on message with lots of other peoples posts in it. I 
said usually...it happens to Sumption sometimes too and he always 
removes the extra stuff now and I havent seen his posts in the spam 
box for a long time. I dont know if thats it, all I can see is I 
notice you can attempt to prove that one on your own. 

A little test for Bruce (especially you Bruce because it really likes 
to block you), Kristen, Rees, Bryan, and Jeremy. You guys posts were 
all waiting for me when I got home tonight. Upon looking at them at a 
glance I can see they are run on messages. Not doing anything wrong 
just hittin reply and it copies the previous to yours. It&#x27;s just a 
fluke in thier spam filter. I guess it sees 4-5 peoples emails and 
responses and sees it as a chain letter or something who knows? Just 
try it and see if it helps things go thru quicker.

&gt; Yes Bryan - I have had messages take as long as 4 to 5 hours to 
come through
&gt; and others get caught in my spam filter.  I don&#x27;t&#x27; know why but it 
does
&gt; happen.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt;   I was just wondering if others have sent email messages through 
to the
&gt; group but they never get through, or they seem to take a very long 
time for
&gt; it to come through. 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Bryan
