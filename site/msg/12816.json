I&#39;m guessing that spirits may need some time to work the device and by inviting them and letting them experiment it freely, they might be able to use it as wished.  In theory, they should be able to get a so clear a transmission through the diodes that they would be able to send music... theoricly-theorising-speaking theory.  Too bad I&#39;m so busy with the mundane at the moment.\n\n\nBy the way, you need to name that box :-)\n\nVincent Rodrigue, SQIP\n\n\n----- Message initial ----\nDe : M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt;\nObjet : [EVP-ITC] Re: Diode EVP Capture Device I built\n\n[snip]\nWouldn&#39;t that be cool if entities were using this as a form of \ncommunication...\n\nThanks,\n- Mike (UFO Geek)\n\n\n      Devenez un meilleur amigo grâce à Yahoo!
