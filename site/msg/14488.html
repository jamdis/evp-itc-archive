Yes-it would be very interesting. I already know first han=

'm not trying to say I know how a spirit could record on an analog recorder=
, or if they can at all: my point was that it wasn't reasonable to assume i=
t could directly change the bits on digital media and wind up with anything=

        But, were I to conjecture, one might say that the air pre=
ssure of a voice is converted to a signal that modifies the magnetic proper=
ties of a tape.  And a line recording uses a signal, not from the mic, but =
from some other source, to do the same.  So if that signal were to be manip=
ulated via external EMF, it would change the final result on the tape.  

 =
       Since we are also assuming that digital recorders can pick up spirit=
s, then the simplest explanation is that that same up-front signal (before =
it gets digitized into bits) is also being manipulated.  And an EMF source =
could theoretically manipulate both the analog tape signal, and the digital=
 tape signal.

 Your points seems to be that you can make it work without knowing how it w=
orks.  So we need to talk about what you mean by that.

                  W=
hen you use the microphone, you just speak, and let the recorder do the res=
t.  In this case, you are using the recorder without really knowing how it =
works.   If a spirit can manipulate the EMF field around the AtoD converter=
 (even without using the mic), then they should be able to do the same: jus=
t use it without knowing how it works: the recorder does the rest.  In neit=
her case do either of you need to know how it works, to get it to work. I a=
m not questioning this.

                  But, if they are going to change=
 the bits on the actual media themselves, then they must know how it works,=
 it order to get all those bit-things I mentioned right.  The recorder can'=
t "do the rest", because by changing the bits on the media themselves, they=
 are going completely around what the recorder does, and doing the details =
themselves.  And as I said, the details there are very technical, and inclu=
de things like converting their words into digital samples of groups of a s=
pecific number of bits in a specific format on specific places in specific =
orders with other specific other bits connected to them like file ownership=
 and dates and such.  It is the job, basically, of a computer, not a person=
.

                  If they are changing the bits on the media, then the r=
ecorder is not doing that.  They are no longer letting the recorder "do it"=
, like you or they would be if they just used it normally.  The reason you =
can "make it work" without understanding it, is because the recorder is doi=
ng the work for you.  If they are to change the media directly, then the re=
corder is no longer doing the work, and so they must understand all those d=
igital issues.

                  So that is the difference between being a=
ble to use it without understanding it, and not being able to use it.

                    I never meant to insinuate exactly how it could=

 free space and where there isn't, link the herds together with some sort o=

hings like date/time modified and size, respect any kind of ownership permi=

              =
    as I said, the details there are very technical, and include 
         =
         things like converting their words into digital samples of
