I'm sitting here minding my own business and i'm dragged into yet ano=
ther negative post.

This used to be a great group and an original for this=
 field, about 6 years ago before anybody knew about ghost boxes a few of us=
 were here doing our research and posting our stuff. 

Just look in the arc=
hives to see the activity we use to have here.  It's true, i do use this gr=
oup mainly to allow fellow enthusiasts to own a decent box at a cheap price=
. 

There are 900 people here to target, although there never is a post any=
more. 

Me and others do all of our posting at my RTSC yahoo group, where i=
 help individuals daily with advice and links to FREE downloads and ideas t=
o test and try.

Despite what frank says, i never claimed to invent anythin=
g or say he didn't.  That all came from his brain and it was all made up.

=
All i did was add a function generator kit for $10 to a radio to make it sw=
eep.  I got the idea from Rich Georgina on my group, that wasn't my idea ei=
ther.

All these things are all documented everywhere with me giving all th=
e credit to Bill Chappel, frank, rich, joe.

Somehow franks lies went mains=
tream about me.  If you don't believe what i'm saying, i have all this FREE=
 information documented on my site for 6 years now.  I have never made any =
money off of anybody and i offer everything for Free on my site including a=
ll the hacks i did and how to make your own ghost boxes with a sweep circui=
t.  I even have the links on where to get the parts to build them cheap.

S=
o before you post something else negative, do your homework on who people a=
re and what they have contributed without any fame in mind or monetary moti=
ves.
