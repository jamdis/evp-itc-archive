<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m willing to bet that if you heard any word more than once -- bitch especially -- this is a message.  If you neglect to say some sort of protection prayer before conducting your session, you are more likely to attract entities that use those kind of words.  In my experience (which is short), the entities will repeat words over and over, just so you can pick these words out and know you&#x27;re not imagining them.  Look for patterns, and ask for nothing negative to come through during the session (although that doesn&#x27;t always work).

&gt; I tried this for the 1st time today.I am somewhat perplexed- is there any
&gt; way that the allophone files can randomly generate words... like &quot;bitch&quot; - I
&gt; am fairly sure I heard this a number of times, as well as other bits and
&gt; pieces? I have been experimenting with a few different allophone files that
&gt; have been slowed down. Evpmaker is pretty cool but I guess I am wondering if
&gt; I am just imaging what is being said??
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone shed some light on this perhaps- how likely is it that the
&gt; allophone files can generate words etc?
&gt; 
&gt; :D
