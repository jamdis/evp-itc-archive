Is anyone one there?&quot;  Or do you start calling out names, or do you even pray the night before that you plan to turn the radio on at 9am on such and such a date, or is it when you turn it on they are waiting for you?\n   \n  Also lets say you turn the radio on, and a spirit says hi Rhonda!. From there what is your response? What types of questions do you ask? \n   \n  Is it more like a phone call to a family member, friend, or even just talking on a CB radio to truckers passing by trying to learn who they are etc.....\n   \n  I am trying to step out a method for myself and it is frustrating me that I dont have a plan when I turn that rradio and recorder on.\n   \n  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!\n   \n  Mike Edwards Cary, NC\n   \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nNever miss a thing.
