<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Chris Fleming is selling them on his website for $49.95 + $10.00 s/h. 
Which was my point though. Im sure it can be used effectively to 
communicate, but anything can be used to communicate effictively as 
long as you stay objective and dont read too much into some things. 
So I was just suggesting if you have an emf detector already or other 
things available why buy something which is pretty much the same 
thing you have already. Ive noted that some electronic toys work very 
well if there really is someone on the other side wanting to make 
contact badly enough. For instance right now I live in a brand new 
apartment building.
    We just recently got rid of our house and moved into an apartment 
to save some money up. Usually I start wondering about the history of 
a house or an apartment when I first move in. Considering though this 
building and everything in it or on it are brand new as the building 
was just put up and we were the very first couple to live in this 
apartment. Which is a pretty cool fresh feeling, to be the first 
people to live in a place. So it never even ocurred to me to think 
about its history, since it has no history. Never-the-less after 
about 2 months of living there I start feeling things. Like Im being 
watched. It slowly progresses to actually seeing things out of the 
corner of my eyes, I shrug this off too. Then I actually seen a cat 
in my apartment it starts to come up to me, I kept my eyes on it 
nonstop and it just vanished right in front of me. I really thought 
that was the last straw I no doubt lost my mind.
   Its not like I thought I saw it, its like it was really there then 
as it comes up to me it just vanishes. It looked completely solid, I 
thought how the heck did a stray cat get in my apartment. The same 
thing happened later but with a person, I was coming from the kitchen 
and seen a person walk down the hallway I run quickly to the hallway 
and nothing. I told my fiance about the cat, I didnt say nothing 
about the person because I dont want her to think Im crazy. The odd 
thing was that just the other day she said she seen some kind of 
animal run through our living room , when she went to find out what 
it was it was gone. Her experience was a bit different as she seen it 
cut in front of a doorway. I was standing in front of it and seen it 
just evaporate in front of my eyes. Anyway long story short I toy 
went off on its own across the room while holding my 4 month old 
daughter in my lap. (its an electronic toy with no remote control or 
motion sensor, you actually have to hit a button to set it off, so 
how it went off with no button being pressed was beyond me). So I 
said if there is anyone here set that toy off again, and sure enough 
within a second or less of my asking it did it again.
    I asked if it can understand what Im saying to do it twice, and 
it did. By that time I was really intrigued and freaked out to say 
the least. I scrambled to find my video camera and it didnt do it 
while taping. I thought perhaps low batteries like some would 
suggest. Anyway feeling discouraged I went to the restroom and I can 
hear that toy go off again. Then as Im wondering if it might be that 
toys batters another toy in the living room starts to go off along 
with the first toy. How this is going on in a freshly built place 
where there has not been a house built on the same location before is 
beyond me, a portion of trees had to be cleared for these apartments. 
Perhaps the land itself, or a nearby house since there are a few from 
line of sight, no way for me to tell I guess. I completely lost track 
of my point, but there you have it.

&gt; Okay, its just an inexpensive EM meter. The ELF/VLF detection range 
posses a problem in that it will detect human speech and giving false 
positives. I haven&#x27;t been able to find a spec sheet or the 
manufacturer (K-II Enterprises) to get one. Also, it shows in some of 
the product reviews that it gives false readings if moved too 
quickly. 
&gt; 
&gt; What does one cost?

&gt;   Hey Guys
&gt;       Here is the info taken straight off of the company&#x27;s 
website.  I have to say that it is a very affordable meter and very 
rugged.  I am by no means a professional in this field, but I have to 
say that it is by far one of the most useful pieces I carry.  The 
company is K II (2) enterprises, I got mine off of ebay and had it in 
about 3 weeks do to back log in production.  I hope this helps.

&gt;   Protect your family from harmful EMFs!   Measure the EMF (Electro 
magnetic Field) strength of every electrical device in your home, 
workplace or school; outdoor power lines, underground lines and even 
when you travel and shop for appliances. Health concerns about the 
negative effects of ELECTRO MAGNETIC FIELDS (EMF) from appliances, 
power lines, and home wiring have caused the U.S. Government to issue 
a warning to use &quot;Prudent Avoidance&quot; to help reduce your exposure to 
this risk.   Since EMF&#x27;s are everywhere it may be impossible to 
totally avoid them.  The SAFE RANGE EMF METER from K-II can help you 
measure these
&gt;  potentially harmful fields and determine the safe range to help 
reduce exposure. It also helps you determine which appliances produce 
high level emissions.

&gt;   Good morning all,
&gt;        
&gt;           Chris Fleming used one on the episode about the Manson 
murders before.  I have had one for a while now, and let me be the 
first to say that it works.  I have had numerous two way 
conversations using it, as well as captured video evidence of these 
conversations showing that there is nothing around capable of giving 
off an EMF.  The only issue that I have concern with is unlike EVP 
work or video ITC work you have no recognizable
&gt;  voice or image to positively correlate who the communication is 
coming from.  In my case, I might ask the question &quot;Are you Sylvia, 
my mother, show me two spikes for yes and one spike for no&quot; and the 
meter will spike twice for yes, but I have no voice or image I would 
recognize to verify that is who is causing the meter to spike.  The 
meter is a very useful tool and I do not conduct an investigation or 
session without it by my side, but like the rest of the tools in this 
field it has its valuable points as well as negative points.
