<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Judy, and everyone else, too--please don&#x27;t promote or continue this  
until we hear from Sum. This may not be what everyone is assuming at  
all. My concern is that he has received a cease-and-desist notice  
from Radio Shack, which may have been informed that someone was  
promoting their product in a way not in compliment with their  
corporate image, and that his counsel is advising he comply with it.  
What you are telling people to do may be exactly what his own legal  
counsel is advising against and may put him in a precarious situation.

Please just calm down and don&#x27;t make assumption until he can clarify  
for us. If it comes down to someone making personal threats against  
him, that&#x27;s a whole other matter. But he needs to ask for help before  
everyone goes all posse, OK?
