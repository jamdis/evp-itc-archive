I agree, If you don't like what somebody says, just push delete.=C2=A0 Ther=
e are so many
other things going on in the world to get upset about.=C2=A0 =
You just attract more negativity.

Is anyone else with me on this?

I expect none of us like all the recent attacks, ins=
ults, accusations, threats, hurting of feelings, and attempts to piss peopl=
e off. 

Can I suggest we stick to the purpose of the group: "the discussio=
n, promotion, and developemnt of Electronic Voice Phenomenon, and Instrumen=
tal Transcommunication methods and technologies as used in the communicatio=
n with spirit, and other entities."

And that we go with Frank's philosophy=
 "just take the approach, try different methods, see what works."

No more =
threats. No name calling, insults, or accusations. Just try to keep a posit=
ive group attitude, be open that not everyone believes what everyone else d=
oes, and that's ok?
