I talked with \nMike Coletta recently and he suggested I post how I set up my laptop \nand also my results.\n     My goal is to turn my laptop into a self-contained, portable EVP \nrecorder.  Here&#39;s what I did, and also what happened.  I&#39;ve posted \npictures of the setup under LapTop and Laptopmp3s so you can see and \nhear what I have been getting.  \n     For software, I am using Audacity, EVPmaker and Audition 1.0. \nThe laptop is a Dell M1210 with a 1.66 ghz duo processor and 1gb of \nram.  It is about a year and a half old.  It is a small laptop with \nlittle teenie speakers.  For initial playback, I have an enclosed ear \ntype headset.  For portability, I also have earbuds.  Lastly, I went \nto Fry&#39;s (electronic superstore) and bought the smallest, cheapest \n($9.95) microphone.  \nHere is how I use all of the above\n \nFirst, I make sure the computer knows the microphone is plugged in \nand that it is working, open the Audition software, click &quot;new&quot;, then \nselect &quot;11025, mono, 16bit&quot; from the next menu.\n \nSecond, I start the EVPmaker software and open the 1 minute .wav file \nI found online of a doctor giving a talk.  I then click the &quot;extras&quot; \ntab and select &quot;normalize signal.&quot;  This basically increases the \nvolume of the EVPmaker output.  &quot;Segments&quot; are set at &quot;80&quot;, &quot;Overlap&quot; \nand &quot;Z-Cross&quot; are checked.  Under &quot;Play EVP&quot;, select &quot;continuously&quot;.  \nThen I click the yellow play button.  It is now babbling..\n\nThird, open Audacity software, and under &quot;generate&quot; select &quot;white \nnoise&quot; and create a 10 second clip of white noise.  By \nholding &quot;shift&quot; on the keyboard while clicking on the play button, it \nwill play the noise as an endless loop.  It usually drowns out the \nEVPmaker, and the volume is adjusted by using the slider that appears \nnext to the graphic waveform of the opened file, not the volume \ncontrol that is located higher, under the Play/Pause buttons.  The \nupper slider adjusts the master volume for .wav files playback and \nshould be left at maximum.  I adjust it so it accompanies the \nEVPmaker sounds, kind of a background noise and not too loud.  Listen \nto my files and you can get an idea on how the level of the white \nnoise/EVPmaker is set. \n\nFourth, microphone is placed on the laptop keyboard right next to the \ntouchpad, aimed at the computers speakers.  I use a bit of plumbers \nputty to hold it in place.  All of the programs can be sized to fit \non the screen at the same time.  See picture in photo section.  Next, \nrecording is started in Audition.   I did a few trial runs to get all \nthe sound levels right.  To ask questions, I simply lean forward and \nspeak into the microphone while all programs are running to check the \nsound levels.  That&#39;s it.  I record 3 minutes at a time and ask 3-4 \nquestions during that time.  I&#39;ve noticed the sound from the laptop \nspeakers does bounce off my chest and then the laptop screen, \ncreating a Doppler effect when I lean forward.\n  \nOnce everything was working, I started my sessions.  First, I read \na &quot;statement/prayer&quot; to clear the air and set forth the rules.  I \nalso remind &quot;them&quot; to be really clear because I willl not do signal \nprocessing to pull their messages out .  I get all the software ready \nto go, then start recording first, so I don&#39;t miss anything.  Then I \nhit play on EVPmaker and Audacity.  \n\n     My first sessions were done using my desktop computer, and \nasking questions to see if this setup would work, then I used the \nsame setup the laptop and asked the same questions.  These files are \nin &quot;setup&quot; folder.  \n     My next sessions were focused on asking about an unusual light \nthat my wife and I saw in the middle of the night in the desert in \n1973.  I have no idea what we saw, but now have some answers.  These \nfiles are in &quot;desert experience&quot; file.  My questions were not leading \nin any way, nor did I speak aloud any details of the lights we saw.\n     I have a few other mysterious things that have happened in my \nlife I want to ask about using this system.  I feel more like an \nexperimenter than a researcher.\n\n    I am absolutely amazed at the answers and statements I \nhave &quot;received&quot; right off the bat.  They are clear  I don&#39;t process \nthe recording at all, other than to normalize the files - and \nrelevant to the questions posed.  They range from Class A to Class \nC.  There are some other things I want to try in the future, but for \nnow, I&#39;m happy with the results.\nThank you to Mike Coletta for inspiration and help\nBill Liscomb"}
