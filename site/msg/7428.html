Well,
  If you actually have something...it is wrong for you to hide it...
  I haven't slept well since the 1970"s...
  There are crimes to be solved...the dead are screaming for help...
  Sometimes, all forensics needs is a direction...
  Frank...if this is actually your name...jeese...do the world a favor...do the right thing and show us how to help them...if we help the dead...we help thousands of the living.
  But understand what you do...the religious right will hate you.
  It goes against everything "they" say about the human soul.

love the communication who ever they are and pretty much have to 
leave it at that. I think this is what makes it so fascinating to 
me, that so much of the communication we receive is unknown in 
origin. You have taught us that we should take this as it comes, and 
not hold too much truth to some of the messages.
