I got pretty good at keeping the \ndial moving at a constant rate of speed. This is not nearly as good \nas Frank&#39;s &#39;hands off&#39; random tuning method but it still produced \nsome results. What impressed me most is that some of the voices sound \nthe same, even though I tuned through several channels. This attached \ncapture could be a technical message.\n&gt; &quot;Plug a million hertz&quot;   One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which \nis close the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.\n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&"}
