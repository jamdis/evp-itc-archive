<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks so much for listening Bruce .. Not sure which one was the only 
file you were able to hear .. Was it from the &quot;SuperBox&quot; or 
the &quot;MiniBox&quot;? ... I&#x27;ll post some &quot;Manual Sweeps&quot; soon to see if they 
are clearer than the &quot;Boxes&quot; ..

Debbie

&gt; Misty,
&gt;  
&gt; The only file I heard pretty close to what you labeled it was the 
first one.
&gt; to me the rest are nothing, that may be because I am so used to 
listening to box files.

&gt; I can hear that. Only one problem with that, I dont use a &quot;box&quot; 
never have. However they have been talking about my &quot;box&quot; for quite a 
long time. Perhaps ST is what they mean. It&#x27;s what most of the boxes 
have come to be based on.

&gt; I just opened some files that Misty sent (btw Misty - I really 
appreciate your help!) and then I spoke to the &quot;MiniBox&quot; ... I&#x27;ve 
been asking a question every 10-15 seconds ..I listen back and 
disregard and cut out what&#x27;s not clear (or doesn&#x27;t make sense to 
me).. I expect (lol- hope) to have the question and answer included 
in the 10-15 seconds ..Debbie
