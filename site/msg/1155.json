I placed a suction cup induction coil (Radio Shack) on top of a package of small rare earth magnets and found the package became a very sensitve contact microphone. I tested placing this combo on several objects around the house as a test. The most sensitve object was my old Presto quartz heater. I set the combo on top of the heater and have recorded a few sessions that had good results. Best results were using AM radio sweep in the background. Here is an example and photo&#39;s of the set-up. The induction mic gets plugged into a pre-amp (not shown).\n\nDave (NOT EVP): &#39;Please test with us, thank you&#39;\nResponse : &quot;I teach people to talk&quot;\n\n\nDave\r\n----__Part.20070414101103.E3E5373D\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg\r\nContent-Type: AUDIO/MPEG; name=&quot;041407iteachpeopletotalk.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;041407iteachpeopletotalk.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__Part.20070414101103.E3E5373D\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg\r\nContent-Type: IMAGE/PJPEG; name=&quot;MVC-669F.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;MVC-669F.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__Part.20070414101103.E3E5373D\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg\r\nContent-Type: IMAGE/PJPEG; name=&quot;MVC-670F.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;MVC-670F.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__Part.20070414101103.E3E5373D--"}
