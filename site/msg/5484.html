<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank,

Let me say at the onset this is not meant as an attack and I will not 
get into a pissing match over it, but I did feel I needed to address 
it.

I promised myself that I would not post a response to any one 
person,only to a subject in general, but I will have to break that 
promise on this one.

I think your response to the ritual protection post was egotistical, 
careless and uninformed. That was the response I would expect from a 
close minded sceptic that had no real experience in this field.

As a researcher in the paranormal in general you should know that 
there is a very real and present danger from darker entities, 
especially in the field of box research that is still in its infancy 
and our knowledge is not advanced enough using this method to be so 
hap hazard about it.

All are entitled to their own opinion as far as the way they go about 
their own research but to advise that protection from the negative 
means nothing and to do it in an open forum where there are 
impressionable new individuals that are just entering into this 
research is very careless on your part.

Some researchers here including Steve and myself among other have 
recorded files with messages that tell us that the communication 
process is being hindered at that time by what we refer to as 
&quot;dark heads&quot; and our spirit contacts actually use that term. they 
have also told us when asked why communication was so bad that it was 
being blocked by negative entities. 

I only one of a few that have gotten this exact communication. So 
there is a real threat from negative energy or entities.

Plus through research we have found that it is possible for entities 
to travel back and forth between our realms during an open box 
session. If you listened to numerous files Steve and I have posted 
asking our friends mike and Lisa on the other side to insure that all 
and any spirits that may have traveled through please go back and 
have gotten conformation from them every time.

If it is possible for an entity to travel through the portal that a 
box MAY produce then it stands to reason it is possible that it can 
be a dark entity.

As far as fear goes, I agree wholeheartedly, fear definitely feeds 
the negative. And that is my point. The protection ritual does not 
create a relative tangible barrier, it is simply a metaphoric symbol 
of putting your mind in the right place so as not to feed this 
negative energy.

And the protection we receive from our tech/guides on the other side 
in my belief is very real, I believe they do actually run 
interference for us as far as negativity goes and the part of the 
ritual where we invoke their help is just a form of respect and 
acknowledgement that they are constantly watching out for us.

this being said, Of course everyone will adhere to their own beliefs 
as far as this subject is concerned. I just felt that your response 
was a little strong and came more from the attitude that I also 
suffer from that is to say &quot; negative spirit yeah bring it on&quot;

But that is not a logical thought out approach to an existing concern.
So make the ritual available for anyone that wants to use it and the 
experienced information to go with it.

My most important concern is the welfare and teaching and eventual 
success of new researcher and this research as a whole.
