Healthy debate is one thing. Yes, it can be a good thing. I am not saying d=
on't exchange viewpoints with people.  But it is only healthy debate if bot=
h parties are willing to consider the other's opinion. I bet you no matter =
what Frank were to say, these people would never consider a word he says.

=
Just as you say, there has to be a mutual respect between parties in order =
to carry on and intelligent debate, like we are doing with this discussion.=


Frank can stand up all he wants if that is want he wants to do, but for a=
ll that, he won't change these people's opinions, and in the end he will on=
ly invite more hassle from them.

He should see that these people and their=
 opinions don't mean anything to his own personal growth, research and know=
ledge.

Engaging these types in petty argument just drains you of your ener=
gy. There is no winner. It is a waste of time and energy. Energy that could=
 have been put to a much worthier task. It is much better to take the high =
road and leave the haters to themselves.

  Well April I guess we agree to disagree.  I feel that is what is grea=

everything.  To me that was a pure attack.  Yes they are debunkers and they=
 won't believe anything, but if you don't say anything and just back down t=
here is that one person out there that will be swayed they way of the skept=
