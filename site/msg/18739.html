<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I use an Olympus VN960PC. It&#x27;s a nice recorder but they have come out with
advanced models for about the same cost as mine. I think they have models in
the same series that record 24 hours or more of audio in the Hi-Q position.
BTW I would only use the Hi-Q position with this machine unless I&#x27;m just
recording notes to myself.

The things I like about it are that it records each new audio in a new file,
it has three general use folders and one that goes by date, has lots of
features and it&#x27;s very easy to use. Batteries last a long time.

Things I don&#x27;t like about this particular model are that it only has 6 hours
of recording time, and you have to use their special program to download the
files to your computer, and it takes a long time. 6 hours of audio takes
about 20 minutes to download.

&gt; What brand of recorders do each one of you use to record EVP&#x27;s or when you
&gt; speak to someone with a ghost box?
&gt;
&gt; We are looking at changing our recorder. The one we want to go with it no
&gt; longer being made..
&gt; We&#x27;d like to find one that is compatible with MAC and Windows Computers.
&gt;
&gt; Your response and input as to why you like it, love it or hate it would be
&gt; deeply appreciated!!!
&gt; We don&#x27;t want to jut go out buy one and hate it again!!!
&gt;
&gt; Thank you in advance!!!
