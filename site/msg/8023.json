I don&#39;t think I would has the patience to do it.  Anyway  was just wandering what it was, and I guessing that anything is possible.\n\njuli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; wrote:            William, \n                   I know this was directed for Misty, but if I may I would like to also answer your question.\n   \n                   The natural back ground noise is used as a &quot;carrier&quot; to reveal the presence of undetectable signals in an ambient.  Misty and many others use water as a source.  I use tap water running in an ambient as the source of white noise.  Other noise sources can be used, such as  a fan, or AM radio tuned between the stations (which is also used by many on this board.) \n                     It is important to call your attention to the act that the voices are very weak, and trained ears are necessary for their identification in most cases.  It is very hard because only a few words will become clear among many minutes or hours of tape recording vs. box research.  This was in my case and I use to get completely frustrated in the process.\n   \n                      Some researchers have upgraded their systems using a germanium diode plugged into the tape recorder&#39;s microphone input (1N34 or equivalent).  The noise generated by this component, and also ambient detected radio signals, are used as well.\n   \n                      I have in the past also left a fan running as wind source, which also proved effective.\n   \n                     I applaud those who focus on this form of communication, for its a lot of hard work and in my opinion.  It takes time, and patience none of which I seem to have anymore and find the box communication more rewarding.\n   \n  Just my thoughts!\n\nWiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n        Misty\n   \n  What is the water method?\n\nMisty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n        I find some like certain methods better to make thier voice.
