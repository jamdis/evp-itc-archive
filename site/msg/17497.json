A lot of the\n&gt; time, they are talking about me like I am not even there. In some of those\n&gt; clips, you can definitely hear them talking amongst themselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; The main voice you hear (especially in clip 4) is my technician, or as I\n&gt; call him, my facilitator. He is the one telling Raudive to ask his question\n&gt; and telling an Other to wait. I have numerous clips where I will ask a\n&gt; question and I can hear him ask the same question of the Others. This is all\n&gt; the personal proof I need (besides my name and facts about my life coming\n&gt; through a broken radio). To hear your own words coming through the radio in\n&gt; a different voice is something that should be considered impossible...but\n&gt; then to get an answer back from those reiterated words, well, I consider\n&gt; that pretty damn good evidence that there is an intelligence trying to\n&gt; communicate.\n&gt;\n&gt; But then again, any scientist can easily say that I was experiencing\n&gt; nothing more that a Ham radio operator having fun at my expense. My only\n&gt; come back to this is that since I still a ghost hunter, I have traveled\n&gt; extensively to different locations. I have been bringing my box out in to\n&gt; the field for location experiments. Guess what? My facilitator speaks in\n&gt; every spot, in every state that I have tried this in.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tim\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, leongbabe@...\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Tim,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for sharing your files - I heard a lot of different names in your\n&gt; clips Nos. 1-3, including the names Tim, Mark, and Steve; in clip No. 2,\n&gt; sounded like they&#39;re mostly talking among themselves.
