<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Al,

I use the Roland Edirol r-09, it has a SD slot and works really well 
for me.

&gt; Hi Al,
&gt; Do you know if there is a digital voice recorder that has an SD 
card slot? That would be nice to switch SD cards from time to time. 
Especially if one had a great EVP. 
&gt; How does listening to EVP&#x27;s make you feel about the dead? This is 
not meant to be a theological argument in any way. Just a 
question...I am a medium, and I approach the subject as a medium. But 
then I am involved with being a medium daily. 
&gt; 
&gt; Al, thank YOU for your honest and kind reply. I appreciate your 
taking the time out of your busy day to reply to me. The time and 
effort does not make typing easy for you. 
&gt; Blessings,
&gt; (The Other...) Al
&gt; 
&gt; Al, this is the other Al, heh. I like the Olympus and have three of 
them and one Sony. IMHO the Olympus beats Sony hands down. Model WS-
300M is my favorite. I believe it runs 24-hours -- I use it for 
overnight evps in houses and have captured very clear sounds. It is 
stereo and snaps apart to convert into a memory stick complete with 
usb. You can store data/text files and music, and the tiny speaker is 
excellent. This thing is so light a good Cuban cigar weighs more. I 
believe these go for $150 or so, but I got this one new on ebay for 
$65. Another good one I use all the time is Olympus VN-960PC, which 
may not be in mfg. any more. It records about 16 hours and is 
slightly larger, but has a darn good mike and I like the clip for the 
shirt pocket. Also it has a lighted display (as does the ws-300m) 
thhat&#x27;s larger than the other one, consequently with bigger figures 
for easier reading. You didn&#x27;t ask for this, but the one I&#x27;d avoid is 
the Sony icd-st25. The sound is nowhere near true and though it has 
most of the features of the Olympus models the sound quality is first 
in my book. I think all of these are available at wally world, 
costco, and circuit city, though you can usually save a lot at ebay 
if you&#x27;re patient.
