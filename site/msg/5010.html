<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>For auction - USED (older 2006 version) Radio Shack 12-470 Digital 
Stereo Radio, with AM/FM/TV/Wx bands.
WARNING: The radio portion works fine but there seems to be something 
wrong with the scan-and-stop mode. It does start scanning and searching 
for a station when I push the up or down button for 1 second as 
decribed in the directions; but then the radio never stops on any 
station.
It just keeps going, continually sweeping the entire band it is 
currently on.  What good is this if it doesn&#x27;t stop on a radio station?
All I hear coming from the speaker are snippets of raw audio.  Just 
linear sweeping raw audio.
I can not figure any use for this, so I decided to sell it.
It works fine as long as you don&#x27;t try to scan and search for a 
station, then as I said it just goes on a linear sweep of the band 
until you stop it or turn it off.
