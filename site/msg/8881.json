That \nmakes this more real to me and they know that.  I don&#39;t believe they \ncurse because they don&#39;t like me, i think they know i post the audio \nfor others to hear and want to prove their existence.  I also got \nthe &quot;Are We Dead?&quot; file.  That maybe the first clear message that&#39;s \nrelevant to what we are doing, it must be grounded spirits asking \nthat.  If anyone has any thoughts of who would say that, it may be \nanother discussion.  Maybe it&#39;s not grounded spirits, but whom than?\n\n-Steve H."}
