<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sarah Estep of AA-EVP, but they changed their name to some world thing, trying to suggest they are toe worlkds only experts, and top authoriy. they are the ones that claim to have thuroughly debunked the boxes. So why would you want to join them, so you can have yet someone trash all your voices?

 So far it&#x27;s been my experience that the EVPs and messsages are personal, and not too many others are going to hear what you get, we seem to get enough that others can hear though, to show there is somehting to it. I tend to get vey annoyed by the ones that somehow seem to have more better hearing, and what they hear is 100% valid.
