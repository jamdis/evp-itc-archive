I think it should be a brief description on how to do all \nthe hacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; 12-469 old\n&gt; 12-469 current\n&gt; 12-470 old\n&gt; 12-820 current\n&gt; 20-125 current\n&gt; \n&gt; Did I miss any?  For a $1 listing fee, and no hassles of buying \nproduct in advance then \n&gt; having to ship, that would be totally worth it.  Unlimited \ndownloads (for how long can you \n&gt; list - 9 days?) would reach a heck of a lot more people than \nselling units at cost.  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; opps I mean:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can someone send me the written instructions on how to hack the \n12-\n&gt; &gt; 469!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I checked to see what it would cost to sell one of ebay. To \nlist \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it is $1.00 for $25.00-449.00 plus 8.75% of the initial $25.00 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ($2.19), plus 3.50% of the remaining closing value balance \n($25.01 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to $1,000.00)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would be willing to list the one I have plus give the \n&gt; &gt; information \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the free hacking and that fact that you can get one at \nRadio \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shack for $24.99 just to shut this guy down. At the most I \nwould \n&gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; out $1.00 to not sell it!!!! Well worth it I&#39;d say.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Can someone send me the written instructions on how to hack \nthe 12-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 249.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Either that, or anyone willing to make them for $25 + \nshipping \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no profit?  You could then list them just like the ones that \nare \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; selling...so they pull up identical to the listings that are \nup \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there.  :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; \n&lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking if someone would list a FREE DOWNLOAD of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instructions for the various hacks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the Radio Shack units, it could put an end to the \nbusiness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sellers that are taking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of people who are unaware that they could \nprobably \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the units for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen &quot;downloads&quot; of various things listed before.  \nWhy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
