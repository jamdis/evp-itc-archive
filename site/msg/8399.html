Thanks Bruce...Im still workin on the whole volume issue lol..my very first recording I wasnt able to hear myself asking anything cuz I had the box way too loud...so hopefully I'll get that volume thing fixed soon.  I have been doing the thing where I repeat something if I hear it real time.  Sometimes tho I will hear something, or think I did but then  its gone so fast that I forget to repeat what I thought I heard LOL.
   
  But so far Im loving this!
   
  Thanks,
  Rhonda

You have taken to these sessions like a fish to water. 
Very relaxed commentary and it seems you are catching quite a few real time answers.
Two suggesstions, 1 when you hear a real time answer repeat it, it serves as conformation
that you did hear it in real time. 2 make the 470 louder the files are a bit low in volume.
 
Other than that your like an old pro.
