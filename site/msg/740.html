&gt; Welcome to the group Ben =) Its a mix and match group. Some are 
researchers, some are ghosthunters, some just are here out of 
curiousity or to investigate the things going on around them. 
&gt; 
&gt;   We look forward to your input. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Ya know I think I still have some of your evp&#x27;s you guys recorded 
for the Ashleys investigation ages ago. I should run them thru my p1 
filter to see if we missed out on anything. LOL
&gt;    
&gt;   I did that to some of my early recordings and was surprised at 
the results.
