I was able to upload all the \npictures from the spirit photo I got back in December! They won&#39;t \neven let me upload the upside down one to my website.  So my group \nof contactas here must aprove!! :)\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sumption Frank&quot; &lt;fsumption@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all;\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  I was trying to upload some of those predictions I&#39;ve been \ngetting, but\n&gt; started having problems getting to yahoo. I might have to do this \nstuff\n&gt; form home. \n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not that I think the predictions are absolutely true, but \nthey seem\n&gt; important, and it&#39;s been my experience that when I try to judge \nwhat is\n&gt; crap, and what&#39;s real, I&#39;m usually wrong. I wanted to share these \nfrom\n&gt; my site, but there&#39;s a weird problem with Internet Explorer, and \nActiveX\n&gt; controls that locks up people&#39;s computers that try to hear the \nvoices.\n&gt; There is always a possibility that the predictions are from a fear\n&gt; mongering group on the other side, but I&#39;m not smart enough to \nfigure\n&gt; that out. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank\n&gt;"}
