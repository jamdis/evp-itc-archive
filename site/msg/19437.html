Agreed, it =
is the best camera to get. =C2=A0There are several models available: some h=
ave built in IR lights, some have IR / UV lights, some are set-up for sky w=
atching, and others are just plain ol' full spectrum. 


With this camera (=
depending on the model, a regular one with the different options run around=
 $120-150), you will also need the power supply ($12-$20), a tripod, and a =
portable recorder. =C2=A0My group uses 2 of them and each one is attached t=
o a portable DVD recorder that has a small LCD screen, you can find these r=
efurbished for under $100.

Hi Everyone,

I want to get a full spectrum camera=

captures apparitions. Does anyone here use one with success? Or know which =
one is a good one?

Thanks,
Draiga
