I will post a file \ni just got next.  I think when you are in tune to get communication \nwith the other side, it doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s a box or Evp \nMaker.  If they want to talk with you, you will get communication \nwith whatever you use.  I&#39;ve had success with manual sweeps as well, \nboxes are just easier to use for most of us.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Stefan Bion&quot; &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Steve,\n&gt; \n&gt; the wav file has a cue list embedded into it, consisting of 72 \ncues - one for each allophone. If EVPmaker is set up to use the \nembedded cue list, the other settings such as Overlap, Zerocross, \nCrossfade, Segment size etc. don&#39;t apply, thus they will be greyed \nout. These options, and the &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option, exclude each \nother. If &quot;Use Cue List&quot; should be greyed out, then uncheck the other \noptions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- original Nachricht --------\n&gt; \n&gt; Betreff: [EVP-ITC] Re: New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; Gesendet: Mi, 26.

I&#39;m \ngoing \n&gt; &gt; to test out different ones, but was curious of how you set it up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; &gt; &gt; group.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   File        : /Stefan/I little Sir help you eclipse.mp3 \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Uploaded by : evpfan &lt;yahoogroups@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Description : Possible EVP (?) from an EVPmaker test session \n&gt; &gt; using the SpeakJet allophones as a source file.
