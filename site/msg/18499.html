I never quoted you. I was making the point that when you make statements
such as "I just don't believe everything people tell me", you are basically
calling those people liars or frauds or whatever you want to call it! There
are hundreds of files posted here that are the results members of this group
have gotten during their sessions. If you listen to them, the results are
there. The members of this group are giving you the evidence to listen .  


As an example, Frank related the contents of a session . I don't recall him
calling that information a personal prediction of his, yet you said you were
writing that down as one of his predictions.  Please do not insult others
and then be  surprised when people are offended.

Just because I do not get the results you get, is not me calling you a
fraud.
Why do you believe it is?

Care to quote where I said that?

If you belong to a group, and then essentially call the members of the group
frauds, liars or whatever?? about their experiences with Spirit
communication, you should expect to be attacked!! THAT is a very simple
concept!

So now, asking why I am being attacked, is whining?
You think people you attack, with no justification, should just ''take it"?

Wow.

What have I said or done for you to attack me like this?
Is it because I don't believe everything you do? I don't attack you because
of that.
So why do you feel it necessary to attack me?

Here's a reason for you to leave this group RJ
How about we don't particularly want you here, and you are pissing Frank
off......
Is that enough of a hint ?????
We don't care what you think of us or what we are doing....
Start your own group, or find one that actually likes you.

Since my personal results do not show anything paranormal,  I ask experts to
help with the tests: the experts being the people here. That I way I can
learn.  I have contributed a testing process so far, run several public
tests, and even though they were not positive results, I did not "tout it
all over the web".  I have not criticized.  I just don't automatically
believe everything people tell me.  
 
I don't understand why you would think that should be reason to be kicked
out of the group.

 That is really obnoxious! Like no one knows all you want to do is build up
a list of failed predictions so you can tout it out all over the web and
make a name for yourself. There are some here that suggest you be kicked off
the group cuz you contribute nothing, can't do any recordings of your own,
can't hear any of the EVPs, can't see any of the images, yet are quick to
criticize and test everyone else.

 Same old thing, heard them talking about "it hits the earth" again last
night while testing one of those single supply dual sweep boxes, so set up a
hack radio I had handy.
"--BehindTheSun--ComesFarFromEarth--(jack-frag)IsComin'--Session-EarthWillTh
enCollide-ItEnds--Comet-Good(?)". The jack thing is Jack FM, 105.5 FM a rock
station. Presumable 2012. The December 21st date from the Mayans seems to be
a middle number, there's like a window right around Christmas, as they seem
to mention the 17th along with this stuff. Who knows if it means anything,
but what I don't like are those that profess to "know better". 
 
 The unconverted wave sounds a littel better, but it's over 3mb.
