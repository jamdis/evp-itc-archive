I noticed the same thing LC........Then Lorraine came in and said it wasn't  
demonic......
 
Has anyone ask why a person that supposedly has a demon attached to them or  
chasing them is going into people's homes and investigating? Is it just me, or 
 is that a recipe for disaster?

I just got to add to FS' point with respect to Paranormal State.  

Anyone notice Ron Milione (TAPS gadget electronics expert) appeared  
on Paranormal State as now a "demon expert," identifying an EVP on 
the  show as a "demon" by the sound of its voice on the recording?

Then I  saw Ron on the History Channel's UFO Hunters as a UFO 
researcher/expert.  I'm trying to keep count, but that makes him a 
electronics guru, UFO  expert and demonologist! Nice guy, but I think 
he just has a great agent  that can get him these "roles." 

Also, I saw a lady have her home  investigated by the Penn State bunch 
on Paranormal State and supposedly in  need of their help, then I turn 
the channel and see her as a paranormal  investigator on Ghost Hunters 
International! She must have a great agent,  too. ;)

people involved, and you can  tell they are actors, with speech

too well rehearshed and scripted for  me to watch any more of it.
