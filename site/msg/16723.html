Do any of your boxes control the sample time as well as sweep?
I would thin=
k that this kind of control would be useful.  My own 
experimentation sugge=
sts that a somewhat slower scan rate combined with a 
short sample time for=
 each station might have interesting results. 
Unfortunately,  such enginee=
ring is beyond my current electronic skills 
(should be simple, however), b=
ut before I go through the trouble of 
working this out, I would like to kn=
ow if someone has done this already 
and what the results were (if any).  N=
o sense in going where others have 
been already.

 More from work, fo=
und this stereo in the disposal pile, so kept it for 
hacking. I removed th=
e mute function transitors, but the tuning button 
still has to be held for=
 sweeping. I did a short recording to cassette, 
and that's where the "help=
 me" voice is from.
 
 According the "Skeptic" this is just a broken radio,=
 my response--pay 
attention to what the skeptic say doesn't work, cuz it n=
o does work. In a 
way the skeptics are showing people who still have some =
thinking ability 
what is worth while, I think they do a favor.
