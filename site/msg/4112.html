Can you expound possibly on how you are using the Radio Shack hack, 
such as the set-up you are using with the radio?

&gt; Hi Sam,
&gt; 
&gt; I bought a Mini-Box -- the first one off the production line, in 
fact
&gt; -- and yes, it is a lot clearer than either of my two Frank&#x27;s Boxes,
&gt; which I pointed out on the air on C2C.  I also have the RS Hack, and
&gt; it works quite well, and certainly provides an economical 
alternative
&gt; to people.
&gt; 
&gt; For the record, I have no vested interest in Mini-boxes, the hacks 
or
&gt; any ITC devices.  I have stated opinions about the Mini and it&#x27;s
&gt; advantages, and it&#x27;s OK to have those used as testimonials. I am 
using
&gt; a variety of devices in my work, and they are all valuable to me.  I
&gt; travel a lot, so the Mini and the RSH will be the devices of choice,
&gt; especially since they are more portable and less fragile than the 
FBs. 
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
&gt; Rosemary

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new to this group, but not to ITC research. I&#x27;m familiar with
&gt; &gt; spirit communications using boxes like Frank&#x27;s, the mini-box, and 
RS
&gt; &gt; hack. I&#x27;ve seen the picture of Frank with the mini-box. Frank, it
&gt; &gt; looks to me that you are promoting this mini-box. Is that 
correct? If
&gt; &gt; so, is it the only box that you are promoting now? Or are they 
just
&gt; &gt; using your image and a few of your statements to push their box? 
What
&gt; &gt; I heard of the C2C show it seemed to me that it was more of a
&gt; &gt; promotion for the mini-box. They posted something about that 
their box
&gt; &gt; has a cleaner signal and Frank&#x27;s box had more noise to it. Well,
&gt; &gt; sometimes in this line of work you want to have a little bit of
&gt; &gt; inherent noise. I know that the RS radio has to meet FCC Class B
&gt; &gt; regulations Part 15. As for being a cleaner signal, I would think 
that
&gt; &gt; the RS radio would actually be, than the mini-box. I have heard 
both
&gt; &gt; the mini-box and the RS hack and I can&#x27;t tell a lot of differences
&gt; &gt; between the two except for the price. It&#x27;s my understanding that 
the
&gt; &gt; mini-box is selling around $400 and that&#x27;s a lot of money for 
just a
&gt; &gt; AM radio. The RS radio is selling for $24.95 and I know people are
&gt; &gt; getting some great results with the RS hack. Just my two cents 
worth!!
