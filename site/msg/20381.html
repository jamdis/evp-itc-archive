Thank you, Snow! And, guys, I refuse to censor myself, my s=

de/deny what I hear, from myself. If we do that, we miss out on finding out=
 the WHOLE truth, in all its intricacies. We shortchange OURSELVES. You kno=

ie through their teeth, whether or not we say something that looks like it =
might be "fodder". Everything we do is BS to them. They don't even take the=
 time to analyze our counterarguments. I'm extremely confident that what we=
 are getting is paranormal, and I have no qualms discussing it in full deta=

I wrote an article for Tim Woolworth's website Ghost Boxer at itcvoice=

k, I realize how this sounds, but it's not debunker fodder. They truly have=

length... I think they may like to use ten-code... that's my suspicion... a=

 each lasting 20 some seconds long, which are compilations of all the "help=

bunkers! I feel that what we get across these ghost boxes is yes, ghosts, b=

 it's painful not kn=
