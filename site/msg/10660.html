Thanks everyone for your input on this.  I have decided to just let him believe or not believe what he wants and not involve him in my research unless he shows an interest. I know I am talking to spirits on my radio and I have some great files some of which where done by members of this group which prove it. It is nice to know there is a good support group for us believers.
