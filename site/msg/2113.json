I am starting to \nbelieve that certain\nspirits or entities attach themselves to a particular boxes frequency \nand look for that boxes signature. The spirits coming through #12 \nseem to be wondering why they are not talking to Frank, and there is \na new person using the box. because it seems like they are confused \nabout where the box is and who is using it but they are slowly with \nsome explanation on my part starting to get the idea that the box has \na new user.\n\nAlso the spirits that were communicating with me when I was doing the \nmanual FM sweep sessions are now starting to come through box 12. \nAnd I believe they are helping the spirits that may be already \nattached to this box understand the box is in a different place with \na different user. What led me to believe this theory is the first few \nsessions the entities were asking where frank aka purple was. Also \nSteve Hultay when he received box 13 from frank originally began \ngetting questions and statements from the spirits about Colorado \nwhere Frank lives.\n\nI will continue to talk with them about the attachment to a certain \nbox and hope they will do the research on their side which I&#39;m sure \nthey will and we can come up with a solid answer.\n\nI&#39;ll keep you all posted.\n\nBruce"}
