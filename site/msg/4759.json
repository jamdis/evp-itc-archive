I have heard several  \n&gt; where some of the audio is clear enough to stand on its own without  \n&gt; his interpretation, and where his interpretation generally agrees. I  \n&gt; have also heard some where the audio I hear disagrees with his  \n&gt; interpretation, but not to such a high degree that I was overtly  \n&gt; troubled by it--it was in what I would call the high-end of my  \n&gt; tolerance range for subjectivity.  I have heard audio where the  \n&gt; person asking questions of the box clearly heard answered that  \n&gt; appeared to move them greatly without dependance on Chris&#39;s  \n&gt; interpretation.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, to try to sum up for you, my personal investigation led me to  \n&gt; believe that something was happening with the box. I did not always  \n&gt; agree with Chris&#39;s interpretation, but it appeared the same or close  \n&gt; to what I heard a high enough percentage of the time that I was  \n&gt; willing to accept he was not faking it, but giving it an honest  \n&gt; enough go. It led me to start hounding Frank for a box of my own, and  \n&gt; later to buy a minibox from Rick, since poor Frank was beset on all  \n&gt; sides. ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;ve already had some spectacularly burning arguments about what  \n&gt; Chris claims his guides or technicians tell him behind closed doors.  \n&gt; As far as I know, no audio of this is public, so his claims can&#39;t be  \n&gt; evaluated. I think the proliferation of people getting results with  \n&gt; the boxes belies his assertion that only 30 are chosen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Dec 30, 2007, at 11:09 PM, Robin Henson wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think some of you were discussing this recently, but I&#39;m wondering\n&gt; &gt; what you all think. I&#39;ve watched/listened to this video a number of\n&gt; &gt; times and can&#39;t figure out if the participants are actually hearing\n&gt; &gt; responses on their own or are totally relying on Chris to interpret  \n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; them what is being said. I&#39;m disappointed because I honestly can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; hear the words he&#39;s repeating as being from spirit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-wQZ7FU2Vc\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Robin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
