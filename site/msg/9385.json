Rofl.\n\nIf you have a website, I would love to see your ITC photos of animals.\n\nThat is so awesome. I feel that our family and friends take care of\nour pet babies when they go to the Other Side.\n\nMy friend that came through on the EVP on Sunday was such a wonderful\nwoman. She loved animals like I do. She owned a Bakery and lived\nacross the street from me for years. The dog that my first wife and I\nhad at that time was a Scottish Terrier named Abbra (Her official name\nwas Aberdeen, as in the Scottish town) anyway, I used to hear Jean\ntalking and I would look out the window and there she would be,\nsneaking snacks to Miss Abbra who needed bakery snacks about like I\ndo. LOL. Thats when we figured out why Miss Abbra wasn&#39;t losing weight\non her new diet. LOL.\n\nBlessings All,\n\nJeremy\nOkie in New York :)\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s awesome, Jeremy.  I have some EVP of a woman talking to my\ndog.  One time when I \n&gt; was recording, my dog (Kindred) started barking.  When I listened\nback to the session (this \n&gt; was tradition EVP done in silence with a digital recorder) she had\nsaid, &quot;Kindred.  What was \n&gt; that?&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; In another, Kindred barks, then the woman says, &quot;Kindred.  She\nthinks you&#39;re sleeping.&quot;  I \n&gt; also have one of someone telling her &quot;NO&quot; and I really like the one\nwhere someone tattles \n&gt; on her to me, &quot;Kindred&#39;s headed for the dumpster.&quot;  LOL.  Just goes\nto show you they are \n&gt; not only keeping an eye on us, but the animals too.  I think it&#39;s\ngreat that sometimes they \n&gt; are talking directly to the dog.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I only have one involving my cat, Kizmyt, where someone says, &quot;Stay\nback&quot; (the cat had \n&gt; come into the room as I was recording).\n&gt; \n&gt; I have gotten many ITC images of animals, so clearly they are an\nimportant part of the \n&gt; spirit realm.  :-)  As well, I had animals come through during\nsitting with a medium.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for sharing about your Molly EVP!  It made me smile.\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jeremy Robert Huber&quot;\n&lt;JeremyRobertHuber@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello Again Margaret,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I forgot to tell you this earlier. Since you are also a dog owner I\n&gt; &gt; know you will appreciate this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The day before yesterday I received an EVP. Male Voice.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He takes what sounds like a breath and says...Pooch. :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I, of course always have Molly, my Jack Russell Terrier by my side\n&gt; &gt; when I record.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, I guess I have a Spirit Friend that loves animals too. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Grin.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Take care.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many Blessings All,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jeremy\n&gt; &gt; New York, New York\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
