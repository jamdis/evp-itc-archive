(Isn&#39;t it just the Radio Shack Hack?)\n&gt; &gt; Has anyone purchased this book? Has anyone had dealings with this \n&gt; Dave \n&gt; &gt; Oester?  I guess he produces other types of ebooks too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is so much FREE information out there on how to modify the 12-\n&gt; &gt; 469, I wonder if his book is actually selling...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; - Mike C.
