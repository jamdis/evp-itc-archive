<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Most all of my audio files are in .wav format and are between 10 to 
50kb; many of the mp3 files I am looking at in other folders on here 
far exceed my file sizes (100, 200, 300kb in size).

I propose setting a (specific) kb file size limit, and delete those 
that are over it.  Bigger files can be linked to if uploaded to 
esnips.  Allow both .wav and .mp3 files that meet the requirement.  
Making them all mp3 will not solve the issue.

This way we do not have to convert everything to mp3 format when mp3s 
are not always opening up for everyone easily, either.  I have to do 
a &quot;save target as&quot; to download and save it to my desktop first; wav 
files play automatically.

&gt; A thirty second .wav file costs about 5mb to 6mb, in .mp3 format it 
is
&gt; @ 540kb. Most of my message files, which are about 3 to 5 seconds
&gt; (contain 10 to 20 words) are 27kb to 40kb. A huge difference!
&gt; 
&gt; I think thats a pretty good measure to go by. If you are posting a
&gt; single message file and it is close to 1mb, then its probably too 
big.

&gt; &gt; Hi, Misty.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am deleting some of my files, but is there a file size that is 
&gt; &gt; appropriate?  Though I posted audio in .wav files, they actually 
seem 
&gt; &gt; pretty small in file size.  I do not have time to convert these 
and 
&gt; &gt; wonder if they are OK the way they are?  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Please advise...  :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello all. It&#x27;s that time again for me to remind you that the 
group 
&gt; &gt; &gt; is low on space (96% used) and actions will be taken. For now 
&gt; &gt; rather 
&gt; &gt; &gt; than delete everyones files I am asking that you convert your 
wav 
&gt; &gt; &gt; format into mp3 or smaller format before you post them to the 
files 
&gt; &gt; &gt; area.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; One member using 10+ megs out of our groups 100 total megs just 
&gt; &gt; isnt 
&gt; &gt; &gt; going to fly anymore. So starting in May all files that are not 
&gt; &gt; &gt; within size limits and arent in smallest formats will have to 
start 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to get deleted.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; For those who cant convert your files I have programs that are 
free 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to help you do that. For those that dont want to convert your 
&gt; &gt; files, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; you can use esnips to post your larger files and share them 
with 
&gt; &gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; group as links in posts. For those that ignore my posts and do 
what 
&gt; &gt; &gt; you want to anyway, your stuff will be deleted and your option 
to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; upload and share here in group will be disabled.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; As I said we have 100 (one hundred) megs total in file section 
for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; sharing, please do not abuse your share of that space. As you 
can 
&gt; &gt; see 
&gt; &gt; &gt; there are others who like to share too. Eventually we may just 
&gt; &gt; clean 
&gt; &gt; &gt; it out of everyones files but for now lets try and stick to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; compacting the things we upload and make use of places like 
esnips 
&gt; &gt; &gt; for sharing.
