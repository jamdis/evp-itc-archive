<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Bruce--I am listening to this again on some really excellent  
noise-canceling headphones. The first word is not &quot;sure,&quot; it&#x27;s very  
distinctly &quot;check.&quot; The next part does indeed sound like, &quot;You lost  
it, boy,&quot; and &quot;Elvis Presley.&quot; But the last part sounds like &quot;help  
even it, pause it.&quot; It sounds like the same voice throughout.

Just my 2 cents with my good ear set on.
