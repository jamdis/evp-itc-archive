Hmmm; then it&#x27;s possible that our tech is partly us channeling or 
communing with some greater consciousness.  Again, much to mull over!

Thanks,

&gt; Sharon,
&gt;  
&gt; The question of telekinesis is a valid one, I have discussed that 
idea with technical people
&gt; that are trying to further the technology.
&gt;  
&gt; My belief is that if the researcher is able to recognise the tech&#x27;s 
voice it is because the 
&gt; researcher and the tech have built their relationship to the point 
that they have synchronized 
&gt; their spiritual energy and the tech is capable of finding and 
utilizing certain fragments of radio
&gt; speech and frequency to create a recognizable voice. It does not 
necessarily have to be the voice 
&gt; they had in the physical, but I believe if they create the same 
voice during communication it is
&gt; a validation to us on the receiving end that we are in fact 
speaking to our counterpart and not a deceiving
&gt; entity that may be negative in manner.
&gt;  
&gt; Also my tech&#x27;s do not 100% of the time have the correct signal to 
create the recognizable voice and do 
&gt; answer or speak in a different or combined voice. When that occurs 
they tend to reassure the researcher 
&gt; with a comfortable feeling and you instinctively know after a 
certain period of communicating with the same 
&gt; tech/guide that it is in fact them that are speaking on the other 
hand you will also get a strange gut reaction 
&gt; when it is not them speaking. That is the best way I know how to 
explain it as I have come to understand it.
&gt;  
&gt; I hope it helps further your knowledge of the tech/researcher 
relationship.

&gt; Hi Juli,Thanks for your input -- this is interesting -- could it be 
that Mike and Lisa use these fragments in conjunction with psycho-
kinesis in order to modify the tone of these fragments to sound as 
their own voices would have sounded when they were alive? We know 
they don&#x27;t have vocal cords, and so they probably communicate via 
some kind of thought/mind process ... Not to say that all the 
entities employ this method, maybe some of the more identifiable ones 
like Mike and Lisa.I love mulling over things and this will keep me 
mulling for quite a long time.Sharon the Muller--- In EVP-

Bruce, you may want to also add that when they wait for those 
fragments they are in fact Mike and Lisa&#x27;s voice not just any male or 
female voice. They are ones that you identify as being theirs.&gt; &gt;

In my experience through research, most of the time mike will wait &gt; 
for a masculine fragment or signal&gt; &gt; and lisa will wait for a 
feminine one. I believe they try to answer &gt; in the apropriate gender 
so that I &gt; &gt; don&#x27;t get confused about who is answering. Sometimes I 
will get a &gt; response or message that is made &gt; &gt; up of both male and 
female voices together, even in the same word &gt; sometimes but very 
rarely.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And I think when that occurs it&#x27;s because they lose 
the particular &gt; fragment midstream and pick up &gt; &gt; whatever is 
available at that instant to complete the message , &gt; word or 
phrase.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this answers your question and please keep 
asking them. It &gt; forces me to formulate an answer&gt; &gt; and you to 
further your knowledge as a researcher. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s &gt; all 
about.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@:

Bruce,Is it common to receive a response comprised of a mixture of &gt; 
men and women sound bytes/voices (like I heard in this one)? My guess 
&gt; is that we hear predominantly male voices because they&#x27;re more male 
&gt; radio announcers. Therefore, does the entity who announces herself 
to &gt; you as Lisa come through with a male voice at times (because 
those &gt; are the voices that she gets most of the time to formulate a 
&gt; response)? Please tell me if my reasoning here is way off &gt; 
base...Thanks,Sharon--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-&gt;
