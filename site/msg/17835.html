<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>With the &quot;new&quot; digital TV you can use the last channel viewed button to
rapidly switch between two different channels. Here there is some high
number channel that is AMC, and also #64 is AMC, so switching between the
two almost, or maybe does,  result in meaningful messages. Many of the
channels have a second or more delay to get audio, so it doesn&#x27;t work on all
pairs.

 &quot;The answers will come if I (wait?)....simplest believe
&#x27;em---gibberish--(at 8 seconds) Believe My Princess gets it&quot; and I think the
end is gibberish. Of course I&#x27;ll have to wait for the more qualified
listeners judge this to be sure. Just kidding!

 The secret? &quot;They&quot; know exactly what I&#x27;m doing and what I&#x27;m going to do. No
accidental captures!

 The image freezes until the new channel is switched to, the audio comes
first, then the pix, so if you switch before the new picture comes up you
get these little micro sound bits and a frozen image on the screeen, it
takes a littel practice.
