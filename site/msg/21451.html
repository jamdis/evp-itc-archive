Thanks Steve, sounds like something I can really use, Carbonite, got to get 
more files with the peanut gallery first, i did manage to get some of them, 
but the ones about those girls that got killed, and the killers name from 3 
years ago, are lost.  Remember, the Chinese girl, Annie Ye?  Spirit named 
her killer, and all the details and they were right, plus the info. on the 
Summers girl, and other little girl down in FL, they were right about that 
too.  Even the little boy, they named the step mother who tossed his body over 
some bridge, and there were other cases they sloved.  They were right too, I 
think that person David had a lot to do with keeping them truthful.  I sure 
will sign up for that program. sf
