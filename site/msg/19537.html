<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi guys.

As some of you know, I work with the inimitable Stacey Jones in a
ghost hunting group called Central New York Ghost Hunters.  We have a
TV show that plays throughout Central NY (accessible to over 1.5
million viewers total) called CNY Spirits.

In this episode, which has been uploaded to youtube, you can see the
Minibox Plus on an investigation.  It was used in tandem with a poker
game and garnered some amazing results.  The Minibox was used in part
2, and everyones favorite shack hack was used in part 3.  To my
knowledge, this is the first time a Minibox has been used on
television.  You will have to ignore what Stacey says about the
Minibox because she was dead wrong on most of her facts.  I wish that
the producer had interviewed me so I could have explained it a helluva
lot better.

If you are wondering, I am the goofy looking guy with the pony tail and tattoos.

You can check out pt 1 here:

This episode was a followup investigation to a prior one done about 6
weeks earlier.  This earlier investigation yielded some amazing EVP&#x27;s
and flashlight responses.  YOu can view pt 1 here:

These are some of the clips from that session.

The clip about &quot;pissing me off&quot; has become pretty famous because
Stacey uses it when she lectures at conferences.  It is very
intriguing because it is her voice coming through the Hack while she
is sitting at the table.  I have discussed this clip with a few of
you, and here it is a lot cleaner than in the video.

The rest of the clips are from the poker session that were not in the
video.  On the &quot;Holding a Five&quot; clip, Mike actually had a pair of
fives in his hand.
