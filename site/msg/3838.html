          Frank,
 
After doing box research for a while now and having the opportunity to work with several different
types of boxes. I would have to agree the boxes are meant for and work better as a stationary communication device 
sort of like a communication station that is consistently under the same basic conditions. I have never taken my boxes out of my home
or done a session out side of my home and I don't believe that taking the box , any box not just yours to a remote allegedly haunted location
will not serve to enhance communication. And if anyone is really concerned about summoning dark entities they have a much better chance
of that communicating with a grounded and maybe disgruntled or confused entity at a haunted location.
 
so I agree with your assessment of box use 100%

      This 'negativity' is bad enough, I wouldn't even want it on the group except Moon is the one that says everyone else,  me and the group included, gets only 'false communcation' or 'bad guys', and that's from his own friggin' blog, I didn't make that up, or pull it out of my butt. So it effects us all, and I think is open for discussion/comment knowing this will get forwarded back to him. In fact I'll cc Moon this posting. 
 
 When he says all these scan radio users, that means me to, since I use the things, and I prefer the linear scan mode. What I say about the box use is completely disregarded, and what I get through the box, myself, as The Box Maker, is minimalized by Moon. Moon puts my name out there connected with his so called 'telephone to the dead', and I very much disapprove of my name being applied to an unauthorized use of my equipment. I don't give a crap what he gets through the boxes, or does with it, but don't make it look like I designed it specificaly as the 'telephone to the dead', I designed it as a friggin' ITC device, that is capable of two way communication--SOMETIMES, it's not like it's a guarenteed connection, and you can't just dial up anyone, anytime, that's an exageration! The "box" was intended by me to be used in a fixed location, just by taking it to a GHU, or an "investiigation" is using it in a way I did not intend, and I still say it's better if used in one
 place. All guide lines I have offered for box use are completely ignored, not just by Moon, to be fair.  
 
 
 It has been shown that many different approaches work for this communcation, I suggest Moon design and build his own 'telephone the dead' and leave my name out of it.
