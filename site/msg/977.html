<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all,
I am a fairly new member and have been reading posts here for a short 
time.
I found this group through a link from Frank...hi Frank...and am very 
interested in what you all are posting about.

I consider myself to be a beginner at EVP, but have been practicing 
for years.  I have in no way perfected it, but then again it seems no 
one has....but I am constantly upgrading, only to find the older 
tools seem to work better.

I am interested in knowing how or where to hear these evp clips you 
have been posting about most recently.  Looked in the files and links 
here and found nothing recent.
Can someone clue me in?  

Also, I want to learn how to use the am radio sweeping for evp.
I have a few oldies around here I&#x27;d like to try it with, but i need 
to know how and what to connect it to.  
If anyone has time to explain it in layman&#x27;s/beginners terms I&#x27;d 
appreciate it very much.  

I am also practicing on an old 1950&#x27;s reel to reel.  I&#x27;ll let you 
know what I come up with.  Very exciting.

I am not a &quot;ghost hunter&quot;, not into finding anyone&#x27;s relatives that 
have passed on...just connecting to the other side for beneficial 
and/or useful information for myself, and others.  It gets more 
interesting as I go along.

Nice to meet/read you all and will write more soon.
