Don&#x27;t let idiots get you down. I don&#x27;t blame you for being pissed, but everyone laughed at the idea of the world being round once upon a time, so don&#x27;t give up. The proof is in the pudding. If they can&#x27;t see that, it&#x27;s their loss, not yours.

&gt; A show that i had no knowledge of berading me and frank for an hour. At least they could have had us on to defend ourselves. Not knowing what we do at all, most of what they said is based on conjecture and 100% false.
&gt; 
&gt; Listen for yourself and see. David Rountree is a huge piece of crap and adds nothing to any field or life for that matter. If you see a picture of him, you would want to punch him repeatedly.....at least that&#x27;s how i feel.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Rorke i thought was a good guy, but he&#x27;s no better than the other skepdickheads.
