     A short time ago, I got the idea that I could do my own EVPs 
here at home,see my posting, &quot;Newbie&quot; on December 9th. I talked with 
Mike Coletta recently and he suggested I post how I set up my laptop 
and also my results.
     My goal is to turn my laptop into a self-contained, portable EVP 
recorder.  Here&#x27;s what I did, and also what happened.  I&#x27;ve posted 
pictures of the setup under LapTop and Laptopmp3s so you can see and 
hear what I have been getting.  
     For software, I am using Audacity, EVPmaker and Audition 1.0. 
The laptop is a Dell M1210 with a 1.66 ghz duo processor and 1gb of 
ram.  It is about a year and a half old.  It is a small laptop with 
little teenie speakers.  For initial playback, I have an enclosed ear 
type headset.  For portability, I also have earbuds.  Lastly, I went 
to Fry&#x27;s (electronic superstore) and bought the smallest, cheapest 
($9.95) microphone.  
Here is how I use all of the above
 
First, I make sure the computer knows the microphone is plugged in 
and that it is working, open the Audition software, click &quot;new&quot;, then 
select &quot;11025, mono, 16bit&quot; from the next menu.
 
Second, I start the EVPmaker software and open the 1 minute .wav file 
I found online of a doctor giving a talk.  I then click the &quot;extras&quot; 
tab and select &quot;normalize signal.&quot;  This basically increases the 
volume of the EVPmaker output.  &quot;Segments&quot; are set at &quot;80&quot;, &quot;Overlap&quot; 
and &quot;Z-Cross&quot; are checked.  Under &quot;Play EVP&quot;, select &quot;continuously&quot;.  
Then I click the yellow play button.  It is now babbling..

Third, open Audacity software, and under &quot;generate&quot; select &quot;white 
noise&quot; and create a 10 second clip of white noise.  By 
holding &quot;shift&quot; on the keyboard while clicking on the play button, it 
will play the noise as an endless loop.  It usually drowns out the 
EVPmaker, and the volume is adjusted by using the slider that appears 
next to the graphic waveform of the opened file, not the volume 
control that is located higher, under the Play/Pause buttons.  The 
upper slider adjusts the master volume for .wav files playback and 
should be left at maximum.  I adjust it so it accompanies the 
EVPmaker sounds, kind of a background noise and not too loud.  Listen 
to my files and you can get an idea on how the level of the white 
noise/EVPmaker is set. 

Fourth, microphone is placed on the laptop keyboard right next to the 
touchpad, aimed at the computers speakers.  I use a bit of plumbers 
putty to hold it in place.  All of the programs can be sized to fit 
on the screen at the same time.  See picture in photo section.  Next, 
recording is started in Audition.   I did a few trial runs to get all 
the sound levels right.  To ask questions, I simply lean forward and 
speak into the microphone while all programs are running to check the 
sound levels.  That&#x27;s it.  I record 3 minutes at a time and ask 3-4 
questions during that time.  I&#x27;ve noticed the sound from the laptop 
speakers does bounce off my chest and then the laptop screen, 
creating a Doppler effect when I lean forward.
  
Once everything was working, I started my sessions.  First, I read 
a &quot;statement/prayer&quot; to clear the air and set forth the rules.  I 
also remind &quot;them&quot; to be really clear because I willl not do signal 
processing to pull their messages out .  I get all the software ready 
to go, then start recording first, so I don&#x27;t miss anything.  Then I 
hit play on EVPmaker and Audacity.  

     My first sessions were done using my desktop computer, and 
asking questions to see if this setup would work, then I used the 
same setup the laptop and asked the same questions.  These files are 
in &quot;setup&quot; folder.  
     My next sessions were focused on asking about an unusual light 
that my wife and I saw in the middle of the night in the desert in 
1973.  I have no idea what we saw, but now have some answers.  These 
files are in &quot;desert experience&quot; file.  My questions were not leading 
in any way, nor did I speak aloud any details of the lights we saw.
     I have a few other mysterious things that have happened in my 
life I want to ask about using this system.  I feel more like an 
experimenter than a researcher.

    I am absolutely amazed at the answers and statements I 
have &quot;received&quot; right off the bat.  They are clear  I don&#x27;t process 
the recording at all, other than to normalize the files - and 
relevant to the questions posed.  They range from Class A to Class 
C.  There are some other things I want to try in the future, but for 
now, I&#x27;m happy with the results.
Thank you to Mike Coletta for inspiration and help
