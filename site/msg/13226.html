<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello All,

Well... to update anyone following the crash debris session 
experiments; I have received session files from half the people I 
sent plane crash debris. Thank you to those of you who submitted 
files, and to those who explained why it wasn&#x27;t possible.
I now have enough data to produce Part 3 of &quot;Voices From The Scorched 
Earth&quot; video. Part 3 will be a compilation of the other researchers 
ITC session files while using the crash debris. Watch for that on 
Myspace and Youtube next week sometime.  I&#x27;ll post a link when it&#x27;s 
uploaded.

Also... I&#x27;ve decided to attempt another contact using items/objects 
associated with someone who has passed on.  This person was a very 
unique individual in our community. A person who enjoyed life, and 
was also a magician by hobby. 
After he passed on his family had an estate sale.  I was lucky enough 
to acquire a number of his very personal items including a few 
magician related items.
I obtained his magic rings, a magic rope, and a magic magazine in 
which I found a huge bonus.  Inside there was a number of old typed 
pages of his outlining a magic trick he was working on.  Different 
versions of the trick were detailed.  I was a great find!
So... I&#x27;ll be using these items/objects to attempt contact or at 
least see if there is any energy still present within the objects 
related to this man or what he was doing with the items.
And I will be doing a video about this ITC session 
research/experiment.  Stay tuned...
