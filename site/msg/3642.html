<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I almost don&#x27;t want to say what I think I hear...it sent shivers down 
my spine.  Before a female voice there is a clear male voice that 
sounds like it says &quot;GET OUT&quot;

Followed by that is what sounds like a female voice, much softer, 
saying &quot;sprits [something] us&quot;  The something sounds rather 
disturbing...which is why I don&#x27;t want to say it without a cleaner 
version of the audio.

&gt; I have shown you what I did with my three modified 12-469 radios, 
in my 
&gt; videos I have shared on the web.  As of yesterday morning I had not 
&gt; tried my modified (older version) 12-470 yet. Well, I took it to 
our 
&gt; local city cemetery yesterday afternoon to see what I could get. I 
&gt; visited gravesites of people I knew had died tragically and 
quickly.  
&gt; They say those spirits never had a chance to express prior to being 
&gt; taken, it was just too fast.
&gt; Anyway, I just downloaded the third file and listened.  Oh my.... 
it 
&gt; gave me chills when I heard her voice at the last second of the 
&gt; recording.  Am I hearing what I think I am hearing?  Can someone 
&gt; confirm what is being said? (It is the last voice, I think saying 
three 
&gt; words just before I turned the 12-470 off.
&gt; I&#x27;ve placed the file in the folder UFO Geek Files in the file 
section. 
&gt; It&#x27;s named leah_ann_3.wav
&gt; Thanks!
