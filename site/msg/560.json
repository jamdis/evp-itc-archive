Dont worry my work didnt get destroyed LOL.\n   \n  I asked them if they could work with the new machine and got back a few replies. The good news is they can work with it and I had some very loud results on normal playback as well as in depth (other speed) replies. The bad news is I think perhaps they impressed themselves so heavily on my last peice of equipment it helped cause the overload that caused the freaky middle of the night crash. But it&#39;s all good. Things are back up and running and my harddrives were protected. I&#39;d had some warning but mostly dismissed it LOL.\n   \n  Anyway during this process I uncovered a new filter which brings out a new layer of voices in my recordings. I am uploading a couple of the evp&#39;s as well as the new filter settings for clear voice denoiser if anyone wanted to play with them.\n   \n  Some of the evp&#39;s were very clear, some layers were a bit fuzzy. these just pertain to what happened to my system and what thier thoughts were on it. You may notice in the first session I had music playing in the background so it would show me louder levels during recording so I could test it to make sure the mic was even working. They enjoyed the music and even used it at the end of thier welcome message to me...sort of singing it there at the end. I was not sure if there is was hillsburrow tenessee but I looked it up and theres a hillsborough.\n   \n  The 2nd one (never mind the action...)  for me was very loud and clear as well. Have a listen and let me know if you hear anything. Not going to post them all right now but I may post more later after work.\n   \n  Misty\n\n \t\t\n---------------------------------\nStay in the know. Pulse on the new Yahoo.com.
