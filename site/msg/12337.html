ing MP3 format and not larger file compression such as WAV. This 
group has=
 limited space and all files are subject to deletion to make 
room. For tho=

you can make use =
of esnips.com for file sharing. Once uploaded you can 
simply post the link=
 to your files just as it does when you upload 
here. Esnips is free and th=
ey give you 50 gb of space and allow 
multiple file formats as well as larg=
er files. The yahoo group only 
allows 100 mb for the ENTIRE group to share=
 so posting rules had to be 
implemented.
