<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey guy&#x27;s,

I read a few posts in the last couple of days that discuss and or 
mention &quot;serious research&quot;

I thought that I would throw my opinion in for what it&#x27;s worth.

Big surprise huh!

My personal feelings are that I take this research very seriously, 
almost to the point of obsession. I am not sure whether that is a 
healthy thing or not, the other posts pertain to seriousness of 
research in the sense that some individuals believe and practice 
their research on a solely scientific and antiseptic basis.

My definition of serious research is to do my best everyday to truly 
try and make the communication, technology and relationship between 
our world and the spirit world better and to continue to advance it.

I know that our spirit counter parts are working a 1000% harder to 
send the communication than we are to receive it, my technitions have 
literaly told me so. With that in mind I believe they deserve our 
respect, gratitude and full effort and cooperation. To me that 
entails a high level of seriousness when approaching this research.

If we are not completely serious about this gift of communication 
with other realms, then it is not research but a hobby, and in my 
opinion if your looking for a hobby take up needle point.

Anyway that&#x27;s the way I approach this research, just wanted to make 
my opinion known.

AS USUAL!
