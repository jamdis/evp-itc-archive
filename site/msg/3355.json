A \nfloor model was all that was available at my local radio shack.  I \nwas getting a pretty crappy AM signal because of the rain, but it \nworks.  I try to leave the files barely touched to leave the \nauthentic value for listeners.  I can get plenty 469&#39;s, i can always \npick one up and send it to you.  The original files from saturday \nwere from the FM from the 469, that mod took less than 5 minutes to \ndo.  The 470 old style is probably your best bet if you can find it \nbecause it has the built in speaker, but it&#39;s really hard to find.  \nIt&#39;s not the black one, it&#39;s grey.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; These are very clean.
