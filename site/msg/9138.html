<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Oops.  Just realized this is new thread.  What I wrote in the other was:

The posting on eBay/Craigslist could be as simple as:

FREE:  Simple instructions for making your own &#x27;ghost box&#x27;  in 10 minutes or less, for as 
little as $25.  Visit UFOGeek.com for details.  And be sure to visit YouTube and view the

&gt; That&#x27;s a lot better than the simple ad I suggested.  :-)

&gt; &gt; Here is a mock ad I made to put up on ebay. Let me know what you 
&gt; &gt; think and please any addtional information or editing on the ad is 
&gt; &gt; welcome. I will also put it on craiglist or anywhere else that will 
&gt; &gt; be helpful ...

&gt; &gt; MAKE YOUR OWN GHOST BOX
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can make your own Ghost box that functions similar to a Frank&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; box, Joe&#x27;s box and the Mini box. All you need to do is go to your 
&gt; &gt; local Radio Shack and pick up the 12-469  Digital AM/FM Pocket Radio 
&gt; &gt; for ONLY $24.99 plus tax and with a simple modification. You will 
&gt; &gt; have your very own cheap alternative to a &quot;GHOST BOX&quot;.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; (I will insert a picture of the RS 12-469 here)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; This simple modification lets the radio sweep both the AM and FM 
&gt; &gt; band. Instead of it scanning and stopping on a station, doing the 
&gt; &gt; modification (clipping the &quot;Mute&quot; pin) lets it just sweep the entire 
&gt; &gt; band, without stopping on any station. Just hook your Radio up to 
&gt; &gt; some speakers or headphones and while the radio is sweeping the 
&gt; &gt; bands start asking questions and get answers in real time.  You can 
&gt; &gt; also record it and review it later for answers you may have missed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There are several sites for the FREE instructions on how to modify 
&gt; &gt; your Radio Shack 12-469.
