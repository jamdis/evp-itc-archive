It has the familiar &quot;flute-organ&quot; type musical cadence to it....But I believe the voice is more noticable here for others that couldn&#39;t here the Original or Audacity enhanced versions. I really don&#39;t like going this far to enhance. Crossing my fingers :) Please post if anyone can hear it now. Blows me away.....LOL"}
