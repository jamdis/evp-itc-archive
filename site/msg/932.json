The general public has a fixation with the &#39;scary&#39;, this is being exploited and promoted. There are so many ghost hunting web sites. I don&#39;t like the trend, it&#39;s like expanding knowledge and understanding is too boring or something. \n\nDave\n\n--- franks-boxes@... wrote:\n\nFrom: &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [EVP-ITC] Re: learning from UFO hunters!?\nDate: Wed, 28 Mar 2007 08:15:49 -0600\n\nYeah, it&#39;s hard to explain. I see the focus in &quot;ghost hunting&quot; on the \nnegative, seems like it has to be scary to appeal to the public, that&#39;s the \nfirst thing I don&#39;t like. Then there&#39;s the aspect of huntiing, like they are \nafter subhuman animals, or something. Then there&#39;s the implication that one \nhas to go to &quot;huanted locations&quot; to do research. You get much better \ncontacts form higher spirits if you stay home. Then there&#39;s the Hollywood \ntake over of ghost/itc research I don&#39;t like.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nThe average US Credit Score is 675.
