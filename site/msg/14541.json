Dr. Sam El-Khazen recently published =\r\nan article in the\n      Journal of Neuroquantology (study of brain function=\r\n at the quantum\n      mechanical level). In this paper entitled &quot;DNA The Ga=\r\nteway to\n      Time&quot;, El-Khazen talks about the relationship between the st=\r\nructure\n      of DNA, time, conscious perception and gravity. There is cred=\r\nible\n      evidence that these are intimately correlated. \n\n      An import=\r\nant finding for this group has to do with how we may in\n      fact detect e=\r\nxternal influences in the physical world. If El-Khazen\n      has it right, =\r\ntwo EM waves must align in order for the preception\n      process to even b=\r\negin. If this does not happen, there is nothing to\n      perceive, even tho=\r\nugh we may be impacted by an external potentially\n      influencing EM wave=\r\n. The second wave is generated from borrowed\n      energy within our brain =\r\ncells and is modelled upon the structure of\n      DNA strands. So yes we ar=\r\ne impacted by billions of EM signals per\n      second but we actually detec=\r\nt only a small portion of these that we\n      later process in the late-sta=\r\nge perceptual processes. \n\n      This would nicely explain why two people w=\r\nould perceive events\n      differently despite the fact that they were lite=\r\nrally side by side\n      witnessing the same event. Again this is strictly =\r\na matter of\n      random probability, it seems to have nothing whatsoever t=\r\no do with\n      volition or intention. That is more the focus of the later\n=\r\n      perceptual processing which is in turn dependent upon this\n      prob=\r\nabilistic process.\n\n      This could also explain why it is that EVP and IT=\r\nC signals are\n      perceived differently by different people even when no =\r\nphysical\n      alteration to the media has occurred and why different thing=\r\ns are\n      heard more easily at different times by the same person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\n  Huge savings on HDTVs from Dell.com!\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_0080_01C9D9F3.AAB838D0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18702&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;Again, though,&nbsp;I really couldn&#39;t make \nout any dis=\r\ncernable words with it.
