<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Tuned Radio Frequency radios are what the very earliest tube radios were.
They use a series of amplifiers tuned to the exact frequency you want to
hear, followed by some sort of a detector to convert the final signal into
audio. The advantage is that you only get the signal you want to receive.
The disadvantage is needing tuning circuits that all have to line up and
track each other for each amplifier stage.

Eventually superheterodyne radios were developed, which mix the radio
frequency you want to receive with another frequency signal (the &quot;local
oscillator&quot;) to get either the sum or difference frequency. This is
amplified in a series of amplifiers called the &quot;IF,&quot; or Intermediate
Frequency chain. The advantage is that you amplify only one frequency, the
IF frequency, so you don&#x27;t need all those separate tuned stages. You can
also use expensive filters such as crystal filters that only filter one
frequency. The disadvantage is getting mixing products from harmonics of the
various signals that can cause you to receive more than one signal at once,
as well as get &quot;birdies&quot; and other undesirable things.

&gt; &gt; He would have had access to radios that are capable of being swept, at
&gt; least manually.  Pergaps the only limitation was few stations.
