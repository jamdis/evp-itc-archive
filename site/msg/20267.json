My wife has 100 plus dolls and a non commercial site haunteddolls.net where we show them and talk about them. The few EVP&#39;s are a little out of date - they were got in the usual way but it would be cool to have a ghost box because the spiritual events in this place are 24/7..\n\nApologies if I&#39;ve missed it and there&#39;s already a post on the subject but whats the best approach to a randomly scanning receiver as opposed to one that just scans sequentially ? \n\nThanks ! Steve Gunn"}
