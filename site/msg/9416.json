This Radio is simular to the old 12-\n470 it has two boards. When you open up the radio there is only ONE \nscrew holding the first board. When you take that board off there are \nwires connecting the two boards together. I cut the wire which was \nconnected to the board that said &quot;MUTE&quot; which was the second wire from \nthe top on my radio. Then I followed that wire over to the second \nboard and clipped that end too. I think you really only need to clip \nthe one end but I wanted to make sure since I had no instructions to \ndo the hack.\n\nKay\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; How did you know what type of wire to cut?\n&gt;"}
