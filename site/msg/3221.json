The way I read it  \n&gt; was that you have some sort of doubts about the validity of the  \n&gt; phenomenon because you got animals?\n&gt;\n&gt; The images remind me a very great deal of the Belmez faces. Are you  \n&gt; familiar with that case? It&#39;s a classic, so I&#39;m sure you are. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Nov 24, 2007, at 11:48 AM, bruce halliday wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi and welcome,\n&gt;\n&gt; the vpi images are my discovery.\n&gt; If you want more info you can visit my website\n&gt;\n&gt; http://free-paranormalinvestigating.com/\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt; Paranormal Investigating Team\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; From: heartbrkr2000@...\n&gt; Date: Sat, 24 Nov 2007 16:33:17 +0000\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Newbie here...VPI Photos?\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;\n&gt; What are these?
