So... after reading it I decided to \ntry out what the book suggested and placed my Radio Shack Hack 12-470 \nGhost Box into my microwave oven (in the OFF position) and ran a sweep \nin the AM and FM mode.\nThe AM mode did receive much less but a few audio snippets did make \ntheir way through.  The FM mode was a different story. No frequencies \nat all made it through... just white noise as each FM frequency was \nreached during the sweep.\nAs I always do... I made a short video of both modes being sweeped.\nYou can see it, here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQwYmi70-qw\n\nThanks,\n- Mike (UFO Geek)"}
