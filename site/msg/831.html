Here is a follow-up message from tonight. I had asked directly if the Alpha was the best system. Here is the reply.
&quot;Our Alpha contest (beep) Alpha makes best system&quot;

That&#x27;s the way I hear it.

Guy, Alec sounds excited, that&#x27;s good! I&#x27;ll send you the info he wants in a private email.
Thanks,

Dave - 

I sent along your EVP clip to Alec and here&#x27;s his response:

&quot;Guy,
far out man!
 
Had a listen to it in this noisy (Spanish) i/net cafe - even then - 
it shows through even on a one-play - I even think I recognise the 
voice - its a bit like mine, someone from my area.
 
This is absolutely mind-destroying!  Have you told XXX?
 
To establish the provenance of this can we establish for the record, 
the person who did the experiment, what method and equipment he/she 
used, time, date and location.
 
I am a state of shock.....
 
Lemme outa here!!!
 
Alec&quot;

I get the strong feeling he was pleased...:)

Anyhow - could you either post the answers to his questions at the 
end or send them to me in e-mail?

Thanks.

Guy Jackson

&gt; Guy,
&gt;  If you have contact with Alec you may wish to forward the 
attached capture I got yesterday. The first part of the message was 
a salutation from Canada. I clipped that part off and here is the 
main message.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Alpha may be best system&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Dave
