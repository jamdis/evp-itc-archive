No he doesnt believe only 30 can operate it however he also cant build every box for every person who wants one. Frank thinks the sweep tuning method can be used by anyone and I tried it just to prove that theory right/wrong. Works great for me!\n   \n  As for edison well thats a tricky subject. Tho I get &quot;claims&quot; of fame I never believe simply on face value. I document it and I move on. I think the box is like the sweep method in so many ways,  and Frank thinks perhaps it works better than the random tuning so he is incororating it into the box future prototypes. He wishes everyone would try it out a few times just to see what they can get. It doesnt take anything fancy just you, two fingers, and a radio with a knob/tuning dial while u record.\n   \n  instructions are on my website even tho some parts of it are under construction or not working yet you can get to the info by clickin on techniques.\n   \n  http://misty.xm.com\n   \n  Misty\n\nLisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n          Just to intercept before Frank goes into orbit &lt;G&gt;: The 30 people \nthing appears to be what Chris claims, but Frank does not subscribe \nto it.
