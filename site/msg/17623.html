<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank,

I listened closely to the clips and I found only one to contain continuous conversation between voices.  I am continually amazed that you receive multiple voices in conversation.  It never seems to be just one person speaking in your clips (from the ones I&#x27;ve heard anyway).  

There are typically two or more voices in conversation with one another, which, as you know, should not be possible because of the rapid switching of frequencies.  But yet, these voices carry over all the switching.  That should be proof enough for people.

By any chance do you know the amount of time your box stays on one frequency before switching?  Is this time different between random and sweep?

Anyway, to my ears, the best clip of these was the one labeled 0609101820.  The voices in this clip were quite clear.

@.01: Go Back (male)
@.02: It&#x27;s pretty cool (same male voice)
@.04: Awesome (female)
@.06: Hello (different female)
@.08: Help me (electronic)
@.09: Hi (same female as before)
@.10: Help me Help me (same electronic)
@.12: Help me (same electronic)
@.13: Help me (same electronic)
@.14: Help me (same electronic)

Clip 0609102333 had few clear words to be analyzed:

@.02: Hello (male)
@.03: Who has (?pulled center?) (female)
@.06: Whatever (same female)

The 0609101257 clip (the one with the scope) was odd.  There are vocal characteristics present such as pitch and timbre, there are times when it even sounds syllabled, but it does not sound like English to me.  Could this be one of your ET clips?
