<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, had a film crew, and interviewers at the house for almost three hours 
yesterday. I was dreading it, didn&#x27;t really want to go through with it, but 
as usual, not as a bad as I had imagined. We did run the box for the camera, 
and &quot;they&quot; were talking, and saying names of at least some prestent. It&#x27;s 
hard to catch it all  live, so I hope it comes out on the video, and DVRs, 
since the recordings were being done from monitor speaker on the box.

It&#x27;s very hard for me to accept being the focus of this kind of attention, 
but I don&#x27;t see the work stopping, so guess I best get used to it.

Even my little Yorkie was fascinated, instead of being scared to death of 
everything, he seemed to be very interestd in the cameras. Usually the dogs 
bark and bark when someone strange comes in the house, none of them acted 
thay way with this crew.

Then there&#x27;s the phone wierdness, maybe realted? for the last couple week my 
cell would ring about 2:30AM, blockled number, and no one on the it did that 
last night, same thing. Then at about 4a, my phone rang, then my wifes cell 
rang, then the house phone, all about a minute apart the last one, and the 
same thing, blocked number. When it&#x27;s answered, it&#x27;s dead quiet.
