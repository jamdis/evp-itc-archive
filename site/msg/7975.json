I have other files loaded, and only load what is closer to class &quot;A&quot;  EVP.  \n   \n  I am using the radio shack hack 12-469.\n   \n  I record usually in the morning. I work from home, and wait until the kids and wife are out of the house, so I have no interruptions.\n   \n  My personal interest is to make contact with my family members and friends that have passed on. I have so many questions to ask them, etc....\n   \n  Tips are welcome.. I still am playing with the sound of the radio when in scan mode. Trying to get the volume just right where if i did hear a spirit, the sound of the radio does not drown it out.\n   \n  Any advice you can give me after listening to my files, that would be great!\n   \n  Mike Edwards Cary NC\n\nbruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hi Mike,\n \nI have just returned to this group after a short absence.\nMy name is Bruce I have exstensive experience with box research and do my own research with every type of box that is available including the newest Frank&#39;s box that is out.\nI hear a female response saying &quot;YES&quot; at the very end of the file.\n \nWhat box are you using? if you can Mike keep your questions as short and to the point as possible, the longer your speaking the more chance of stepping on a message or answer.\nPlus the shorter and more direct the question the easier it will be for them to answer in a reasonable ammount of time.
