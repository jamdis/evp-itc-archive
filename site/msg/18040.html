&gt; I have placed a little something on top of my computer monitor, right in front of me.  It is now 7/10/2010.  I will leave it there 4 days, and remove it Noon Denver time, on Wednesday, 7/14/2010.
&gt; 
&gt; All you have to do is ask your boxes/spirits/aliens/etc, what it is.
&gt; 
&gt; I have taken a picture of it, and posted it to the files section here, so there is no way I can squirm out of the results:

&gt; 
&gt; Please do not try to open the file before noon Wednesday.  But feel free to download it to your computer beforehand, so you can be sure I won&#x27;t change it during, or after, the test.
&gt; 
&gt; Answers anyone reveals after noon Wednesday don&#x27;t count. Partial answers (like just the color, or shape, or some emotion vibe) don&#x27;t count.  Just tell me what it is.
&gt; 
&gt; Best of Luck. I hope for this to be a regularly occurring experiment, and I hope we all can learn from the results.
