This is my first post in this group, so hello to everyone here. Frank's post
prompted me to reply since I understand the frustration involved in
paranormal investigations. It seems that every time we think we have
something figured out, the rules change - so back to square one again.

I have been involved in paranormal studies from childhood, part of which
came from living in a house which was a civil-war era funeral parlor.Over
the years I've studied most aspects of the strange, from ghosts to UFOs to
Bigfoot, to... well, you get the idea. The last few years I've been involved
particularly with ghosts and have been studying the methods of spirit
communications closely. I am semi-retired now and have plenty of time for
experimentation. My educational background is in Geology, Computer Science
and Electrical Engineering. I spent many years designing analog sensors and
other devices for well logging and oilfield instrumentation.

Which brings me to what I wanted to say to Frank...

Don't give up. Take a break from it for a while, and be less concerned what
others think. If you have high standards, then your work will prove itself.
There are always going to be naysayers and backbiters and they will never be
satisfied with what you produce, so ignore them, and work with those who
have open minds and the ability to use critical analysis without being
totally negative. I believe your approch has merit, and am working on
duplicating one of your devices myself.

The last couple of years I have been closely examining methods of monitoring
VLF-ELF frequencies and demodulating audio from them. This is the world of
'Earth Sounds' and over the years I have had some interesting results,
particularly of voices singing and shreds of speech. My NASA Inspire
receiver was the starting point, but it was too broad banded and desparately
needed 60Hz notch filtering so I have retired it and am now starting
development from the ground up on a receiver targeted for 20 - 2000 Khz in
the EM spectrum. There is more to this than just adapting a high-gain audio
amplifier - a lot of filtration needs to be done and I'm eliminating the use
of any local oscillators or mixers to eliminate possible overload products
from the broadcast band.

Like you, I have a few detractors who tell me I'm wasting my time but I also
have a good research group (A.S.U.P.) who is totally supportive. If you have
seen any of the articles in Haunted Times or other publications about highly
modified K-II EMF detectors being used, I plead guilty. I have built and
distributed about ten of them to various people and groups, and have had
some very encouraging feedback.

So stay with it Frank, don't be discouraged, keep studying, working and
posting...

Thanks for the bandwidth and perhaps we can all exchange some good ideas
here.

Ron

  Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] The rest of the ding file



   Same old story, get a voice that should be extra-ordinary, and not one
friggin' comment. I was wondering over the weekend if I've spent enough time
on this. The boxes produce little that anyone seems to hear, and if it's too
clear, I'm sure some, or maybe many don't believe it. I guess it has to be
that whispery s--- that you have to filter into oblivion to be a "true" EVP,
and I think that's what most are listening for, it has to fit the paradigm
of current ghost hunting knowledge, or it's rejected. I've reached a point
where I'm tired of working on something that seems so pointless. What if
what I hear think I hear is only my own mis-perceptions!?

   Frank-S
