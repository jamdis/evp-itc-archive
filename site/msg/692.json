Those were evps that i had gotten out on ghost hunts. I started at home and took it out on hunts. The thing i really dislike about ghost hunting is that SOME of them are just there to get evidence that life after death does occur but when they find spirits that are trapped or need help crossing over, they do nothing. When they should. But hey thats just my opinion and that and 1.50 will will get you a cup o coffee. I think that sometimes like misty said you start out going oin hunts and moiving on once your &quot;knowledge&quot; has expanded. I think that ghost hunting does do a good service to the public by getting people interested in the after life, then its the folks who do evp that really give it the punch . Alot of people got involved after the movie. I had no clue EVP existed till then, and away i went lol\ni think that if you have the ability to help people &quot;see&quot; the light, you should show it to them. oooh yeah and i loved the other day when you said &quot;skep-dicks&quot; i bout rolled on the floor laughing . However, without them, we have NO reason to improve. :)\n\nMisty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:                                  \nFor some it is all about haunted places.
