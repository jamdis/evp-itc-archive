I put the radio with speakers in mom's old room, and when I came in from  
=
the store, I could have swore to hear her voice, when I said what's your 
m=
iddle  name, it sure sounded like she said it, fast and low, it also sounds=
 
like there  are people talking to her over there, sounds like she's in a =
kind 
of  conversation with other people.  It's still on the AM dial, on FM=
 there 
are  too many music stations, so it's hard to tell which is radio 
=
broadcasting, and  which may be spirit.
