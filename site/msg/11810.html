<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t think Erland was the one bothered with them. Bill  
something...I can&#x27;t remember his last name. And Charlie with the  
ghost coffee pot. She got them, too.

I heard a lot of what Bill got when he used to post it back on the AA- 
EVP board. I remember none of it rising above the level of swearing  
and threats that we get on occasion. The impression I got at the time  
was that this was a group of deceased humans who had formed a little  
after-death-prankster club. Yes, they could be quite shitty. If I  
recall correctly, they called themselves the Fish Group because they  
said they felt like fish looking out at us through aquarium glass. I  
thought that was a really interesting comment on the separation  
between our planes of reality.

&gt; No, I&#x27;ll post it here. It&#x27;s the &quot;Fish Group&quot;. They aren&#x27;t people.
&gt;
&gt; They have reeked havoc with a few researchers I know of.
&gt; Everything from serious poltergeist activity to getting in your  
&gt; head where you can hear them 24/7 - telepathically interfering with  
&gt; your thoughts, and they think it&#x27;s a riot. If I remember correctly,  
&gt; I think the late great Erland had a run in with them. They have  
&gt; been known to harass and be fairly nasty. I&#x27;ve never heard anything  
&gt; &quot;funny&quot; about them. They come through all things electrical and  
&gt; love radios. Which is probably why Frank gets them every so often.
&gt;
&gt; They&#x27;re the types to tell people to kill their family members and  
&gt; all sorts of weird crap. They get a huge kick out of scaring  
&gt; researchers, that&#x27;s for sure.

&gt;&gt; They&#x27;re awful. I had a run in a few years ago. They are more than  
&gt;&gt; pranksters. Damn awful. Clever too.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You&#x27;re not going to find any, I fear. This seems to be an entity  
&gt;&gt;&gt; collective who enjoy teasing EVP researchers. They caused a lot  
&gt;&gt;&gt; of annoyance to other researchers in the past, but nothing  
&gt;&gt;&gt; serious. Some seemed to be afraid of them, but I never really  
&gt;&gt;&gt; heard of them doing anymore than being annoying and prankish and  
&gt;&gt;&gt; sometimes, well, actually pretty damned funny on occasion.
