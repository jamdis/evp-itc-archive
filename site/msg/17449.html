&gt; I agree that science is capable of designing controlled tests of EVP/ITC
&gt; claims.
&gt; I disagree that failure of such tests constitutes &quot;accepting no evidence&quot;.
&gt; It is being honest about the results.
&gt;
&gt; I agree that not all people who say they hear voices on these recordings
&gt; are not lying or crazy.
&gt; I disagree that this is &#x27;proof&#x27; of anything.
&gt; But it doesn&#x27;t mean they are not being honest about the results.
&gt;
&gt; I agree it is &#x27;evidence&#x27; of something.
&gt; I disagree that simply then making a claim as to what it was, must be true,
&gt; especially since different people claim different things, and where they
&gt; conflict can&#x27;t all be right.
&gt; I disagree that those skeptical of some or all of the evidence or claims
&gt; are ignoring them.
&gt; They can still be honest, and disagree.
&gt;
&gt; So, everyone involved could be honest and sane.  Everyone involved could
&gt; interpret evidence differently.  Everyone involved can come to different
&gt; conclusions.
&gt;
&gt; And if everyone involved worked together, using their different skills and
&gt; perspectives, all lot more progress could be made.
&gt;
&gt; Instead of just telling someone what they believe is wrong, we should ask
&gt; them why they believe it?  What led them to that belief?  What prevents
&gt; another belief being as true instead?
&gt;
&gt; This requires conversation.  Those stopping this conversation are the ones
&gt; who will not listen to another viewpoint.    And from what I see posted
&gt; here, they aren&#x27;t the skeptics.

&gt;  I think science is quite capable of describing what is going on with
&gt; EVP/ITC, and able to test it .The problem being, a few who have
&gt; commented here accept no evidence. It&#x27;s not a discussion of whether or not
&gt; science can tackle the afterlife, it&#x27;s an arguement about what is acceptable
&gt; to think about.
&gt;
&gt;  There is more than enough &quot;evidence&quot; to show this stuff is not
&gt; imagination.
&gt;
&gt;  I get voices via &quot;the broken radio&quot; that use words not allowed on
&gt; broadcast radio to show it is not radio broadcast fragments, or imagination.
&gt; Yet, not enough for these so called skeptics, or the issue is sidestepped/
&gt; ignored. I submit there is proof, proof that something talks that is not
&gt; supposed to be there.
&gt;
&gt;  If a stranger tells you his name, do you automatically assume he must be
&gt; lying? If a spirit tells you who he is, must you assume it&#x27;s a lie, or
&gt; worse? Why, because, somehow we know better? If a voice claims to be an ET,
&gt; it has to be lying. Why? Because we all that is not possible.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I would like to try to address some of the themes that have been going
&gt;&gt; back and
&gt;&gt; forth in this forum of late; specifically, the state of science and the
&gt;&gt; real explanatory
&gt;&gt; power,  or lack thereof, it truly has.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Two highly respected parapsychologists recently published an interesting
&gt;&gt; book
&gt;&gt; called &quot;Handbook to the Afterlife&quot;. They are Dr. Pamela Rae Heath and Dr.
&gt;&gt; Jon
&gt;&gt; Klimo. (Frank don&#x27;t even THINK of hitting the Reply button quite yet.) In
&gt;&gt; this book,
&gt;&gt; they have distilled hundreds of channeled messages from many centuries in
&gt;&gt; an
&gt;&gt; attempt to present a comprehensive mixture of what these message might
&gt;&gt; tell
&gt;&gt; us about the nature of death and the afterlife. Heath and Klimo clearly
&gt;&gt; state that
&gt;&gt; this book is not for everyone. It is for those who find the topic
&gt;&gt; interesting and
&gt;&gt; wonder what has been learned from such  communications. Clearly those who
&gt;&gt; doubt such communications are possible or who disbelieve in the concept of
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; afterlife probably will have no use for this book.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Here are two well-known scientists (in the Parapsychology community) who
&gt;&gt; acknoweldge that sometimes it is more important to suggest what might be
&gt;&gt; possible than to stand only on that which is empirically proveable. The
&gt;&gt; very
&gt;&gt; nature of science is to explain where possible and to recognize that quite
&gt;&gt; often the right answer to many questions is &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Dr. Julie Beischel and Dr. Gary Schwartz have conducted extensive research
&gt;&gt; into mediumship. What that research has demonstrated is that there are
&gt;&gt; people who can know things they should not with no known ways of this
&gt;&gt; happening. This is called &#x27;anomalous information reception&#x27; in
&gt;&gt; Parapsychology.
&gt;&gt; The point is that we know this anomalous ability exists. What we do not
&gt;&gt; know, from the Science, is whether discarnate entities are communicating.
&gt;&gt; Certainly the research mediums involved believe so, such is the nature of
&gt;&gt; their compelling experiences. But the Science cannot, to date, support
&gt;&gt; the claim. And that is what is critical to understand here.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; At the same time, it is important to recognize that using technology does
&gt;&gt; not necessarily imply the Scientific Method nor does is mean one is doing
&gt;&gt; Science. What it does mean is that a part of the experience is documented
&gt;&gt; and that might be useful at some future time when Science does have the
&gt;&gt; tools and understanding to further evaluate the documents. Today this is,
&gt;&gt; unfortunately, simply not true.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What is known is that people are recording audio and video and believe
&gt;&gt; they have captured anomalies. Many people think these represent voices
&gt;&gt; of spirits and loved ones. Unfortuantely the pure truth is that Science is
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; simply not in a position to validate this at this time. But that does not
&gt;&gt; mean anyone should stop, nor that anyone should feel they have no reason
&gt;&gt; to guess what might be going on, or to speculate about the phenomena.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It also means that cynics and skeptics who demand proof are going to
&gt;&gt; have a hard time finding it. If Science is not yet able to describe what
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; is that is going on, skeptics and cynics have no way to determine what
&gt;&gt; is absolute proof. They can however choose to accept some personal
&gt;&gt; variant of their own truth as acceptable proof should they so desire.
&gt;&gt; But this is not empirical proof as required by Science.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Dr. Donald Hoffman is an expert on visual perception and is one of
&gt;&gt; the authors of &quot;Conscious Realism&quot; - a scientific theory of reality
&gt;&gt; which is the first to solve the mind/body problem. Dr. Hoffman is one
&gt;&gt; scientist who completely understands how people misperceive things,
&gt;&gt; and yet his controversial theories challenge even some of the world&#x27;s
&gt;&gt; leading theoretical physicists when it comes to understanding. Clearly
&gt;&gt; there are scientists who appreciate this phenomena may well be real.
&gt;&gt; I have personal dialogs with them frequently. You would simply not
&gt;&gt; believe how frustrating it is for someone whose job it is to explain
&gt;&gt; the world to others to have no idea whatsoever what might be going
&gt;&gt; on here.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I hope this helps put a face on Science, and that I have succintly
&gt;&gt; but  clearly explained why Science offers no magic explanations
&gt;&gt; at this time. And at the same time, perhaps this will better set
&gt;&gt; expectations for everyone while recognizing that the work being
&gt;&gt; done here may well have potential merit in the due course of time.
&gt;&gt;
