experienced opinion after lengthy research with both Frank's and 
Joe's boxes. I have contacted the manufacturer for an explanation, he 
instructed me to listen to the audio file and view the demo video on 
his site. After doing so my opinion on this box and the builders 
intentions for it is.

The box itself is not a knock off of Frank's box but a cheap and 
ineffective version of Joe's box,It works on an AM band instead of an 
FM band as Joe's box does. Another big difference is Joe's box 
actually works and you have all heard the files I have posted from 
sessions with it. After listening to this box and seeing it in 
operation I feel that anyone who purchases this box will be very 
disappointed and will not receive any contact from it and even if 
they did they probably would not even realise it for the simple fact 
that you have to have a certain amount of experience with box 
research and operation before developing an ear for picking up real 
time communication and also creating a bond with the spirit friends 
on the other side and also a measure of trust on both sides.

I believe the manufacturer to be a capitalist and only interested in 
the monetary reward to be gained from offering this cheap and 
ineffective copy to unsuspecting and naive individuals who are 
interested in this medium. I do not like to bad mouth anyone, it 
usually comes back to bite you in the ass but I believe that our 
friends on the other side know of our intentions and would not allow 
someone with the wrong intentions to develop a working tool for 
communication. also I believe that a person does not pick the box the 
box picks the person. 

So let him have his short and lucrative run with this fooling 
unsuspecting clients, bad karma always comes home.

Bruce
