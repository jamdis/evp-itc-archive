the panel mic. The panel mic can be turned on and off, and doesn&#x27;t come 
through the monitor speaker to prevent feedback.

it was like it took a couple attempts to say &quot;Randal Is Here&quot; ( I 
think). I have heard the name a few times over the last month or so.

Frank,

I heard o.k. and randal, when you finished the question 
then randal again at the end of the file.

I know thier talking from the other side but it sounds like if
you were standing in a room recording somone in another room
sounds very whispery and muffled but if you listen carefully you can
hear what&#x27;s being said.
