Just testing with me (my one lonely data point) is not as subjective as on=
e person asking their board open-ended questions, but I agree it is also no=
t as objective as it could be with more people, or perhaps more randomized =
data sources.

So while I still have my one data point test open to anyone =
who would like to test their board, we can also add future tests, with othe=
r people, or other "answer" sources.=C2=A0 That would add to the reliabilit=
y of the performance statistics, while collecting more data.

But I think i=
t's best to do one test at a time, yes?=C2=A0 So, might as well begin with =
mine, for those who are so inclined to begin testing, and then see where we=
 go from there.

=C2=A0 I am suggesting a method to determine, 
        statistically, how a=

        be.=C2=A0 L=
ets say I select two people, and in separate rooms, I give

spelling test.=C2=A0 Person 1 gets 100% right.=C2=A0 Person 2 
        gets=
 50% right.=C2=A0 Now, if I later give them a second spelling test, 
      =
  I can start with the theory that Person 1 will get near 100% correct, 
  =
      and Person 2 will get near 50% correct.=C2=A0 This doesn=E2=80=99t me=
an they 
        will, or that they have gotten these scores in the past.=
=C2=A0 But 
        statistically, it is a reasonable assumption at this po=
int.=C2=A0 After 
        the second test, I can examine the deviation of t=
he results from the 
        first test, and update the statistics.=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 If the deviation 
        remains small (if the results remain simil=

        safely assume that person 1 will hav=

        word right, and person 2 will ha=
ve half that.=C2=A0 If the deviation 
        swings wildly, than my statis=
tics may not be very predictive after 
        all.

The same is true with =
the board.=C2=A0 As you said, getting 
        this number wrong doesn=E2=
=80=99t say past answers were wrong, or that future 
        answers will b=
e wrong.=C2=A0 And it is possible it could have been right 
        by mere=
 chance (though very unlikely: winning the lottery is more likely 
        =
than guessing one number out of a billion).=C2=A0 What we=E2=80=99d have is=
 one 
        single objective data point.=C2=A0 It gives a starting point =
for 
        reasonable assumptions.=C2=A0 As you noted, after more such te=
sts, those 
        assumptions may start changing.=C2=A0 It would be inter=
esting to see how 
        they change, if they do.

Different people seem =
to have different 
        feelings about the board.=C2=A0 Some believe it =
gives great 
        results.=C2=A0 Some are suspicious, even dubious.=C2=
=A0 And there are 
        plenty of opinions in between.=C2=A0 My test is =
not for those who 
        believe it is statistically likely that psychic =
tampering would occur, 
        or that the board=E2=80=99s performance is =
just not testable, which is the camp 
        I gather you are in.=C2=A0 My=
 test is only good for that segment of this 
        population who believe=
s or wonders if the board is capable of giving a 
        straight objectiv=
e answer to a straight objective questions, and that 
        such performa=
nce is testable.=C2=A0 To address one of your examples, 
        while it c=
annot show that an entity is reading my mind if it gets the 
        number=
s right, it can conversely show that an actual entity is not 
        readi=
ng my mind (or that it is not performing remote viewing, or that it 
      =
  is not predicting the future of what the right answer is when it is 
    =
    revealed, or that it is not being forthright in its answers) if it 
   =
     cannot get the numbers right in the first place.=C2=A0 But if these 
 =
       things are true, then it begs the question of its accuracy 
        =
anyway.

So again, this is one data point, in what could be a 
        numb=

    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign=3D"top">Asking the =
board open-ended questions, and interpreting 
        the results, is subje=
ctive. Asking for a specific, predetermined number 
        is not subjecti=
ve.  It is about as objective as you can get. 
        <br><br>I am no=
t trying to prove anything, or rule out any 
        possibilities.  I=
 am suggesting a method to determine, 
        statistically, how accurate =
someone=E2=80=99s board, or methodology, might 
        be.  Lets say =
I select two people, and in separate rooms, I give 
        each a spelling=
 test.  Person 1 gets 100% right.  Person 2 
        gets 50% rig=
ht.  Now, if I later give them a second spelling test, 
        I can =
start with the theory that Person 1 will get near 100% correct, 
        an=
d Person 2 will get near 50% correct.  This doesn=E2=80=99t mean they =

        will, or that they have gotten these scores in the past.  But=
 
        statistically, it is a reasonable assumption at this point. =
 After 
        the second test, I can examine the deviation of the results=
 from the 
        first test, and update the statistics.   If th=
e deviation 
        remains small (if the results remain similar), then I =
can more and more 
        safely assume that person 1 will have a very hig=
h chance of getting a 
        word right, and person 2 will have half that=
.  If the deviation 
        swings wildly, than my statistics may not=
 be very predictive after 
        all.<br><br>The same is true with the bo=
ard.  As you said, getting 
        this number wrong doesn=E2=80=99t =
say past answers were wrong, or that future 
        answers will be wrong.=
  And it is possible it could have been right 
        by mere chance =
(though very unlikely: winning the lottery is more likely 
        than gue=
ssing one number out of a billion).  What we=E2=80=99d have is one 
  =
      single objective data point.  It gives a starting point for 
   =
     reasonable assumptions.  As you noted, after more such tests, tho=
se 
        assumptions may start changing.  It would be interesting t=
o see how 
        they change, if they do.<br><br>Different people seem to=
 have different 
        feelings about the board.  Some believe it gi=
ves great 
        results.  Some are suspicious, even dubious.  =
And there are 
        plenty of opinions in between.  My test is not =
for those who 
        believe it is statistically likely that psychic tamp=
ering would occur, 
        or that the board=E2=80=99s performance is just=
 not testable, which is the camp 
        I gather you are in.  My tes=
t is only good for that segment of this 
        population who believes or=
 wonders if the board is capable of giving a 
        straight objective an=
swer to a straight objective questions, and that 
        such performance =
is testable.  To address one of your examples, 
        while it canno=
t show that an entity is reading my mind if it gets the 
        numbers ri=
ght, it can conversely show that an actual entity is not 
        reading m=
y mind (or that it is not performing remote viewing, or that it 
        is=
 not predicting the future of what the right answer is when it is 
        =
revealed, or that it is not being forthright in its answers) if it 
       =
 cannot get the numbers right in the first place.  But if these 
     =
   things are true, then it begs the question of its accuracy 
        anyw=
ay.<br><br>So again, this is one data point, in what could be a 
        nu=
mber of tests, for those who are not ruling out that testing is 
        po=
ssible, and even desirable, when believing, or acting on, information 
    =
    gathered by using this kind of board.  <br><br><br>--- On <b>Wed, =
