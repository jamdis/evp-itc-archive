&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t remember much about 2012 from my visions but I do believe the world will 
&gt; &gt; continue. It is just the hurricanes, earthquakes, tidal waves, and that sort of 
&gt; &gt; thing is what people will think about. I think it&#x27;s because of the technology of 
&gt; &gt; web cams and the Internet will show us much more than the past news we received 
&gt; &gt; about that bad stuff. Which is what I believe the war on terror is actually 
&gt; &gt; about.
&gt; &gt; For your 2012 question I asked Tarot: 
&gt; &gt; It&#x27; is the 4 of cups!
&gt; &gt; We are receiving but we are not happy.
&gt; &gt; http://www.kufty.com/tarot/fours.htm
&gt; &gt; I am just seeing these cups of love( EVP trophies) in front of you. More 
&gt; &gt; EVPs are offer to you, but...
&gt; &gt; Apathy, Boredom, Re- evaluation, Hope, Day Dreaming, Self- Absorbed, 
&gt; &gt; Disillusioned, is what tarot shows me about you  from the boxes and the news.
&gt; &gt; Any question for me as a psychic, love/money/career questions I&#x27;ll answer. Just 
&gt; &gt; send them to my e-mail.
&gt; &gt; Sonny

&gt; &gt;   
&gt; &gt; Interesting. I&#x27;ll have to remember your story next time I get negative about 
&gt; &gt; this stuff. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t ask, but ya get anything for 2012? I get all the doomsville 
&gt; &gt; junkfrom the boxes, but I&#x27;m not convinced.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I alway had the EVP thing happen to me on a nomal radio. I tried to explain 
&gt; &gt; &gt;that 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I had EVPs on the radio since the early 70&#x27;s. Back then people would think EVP 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; was evil and many would attack me even though I was under age. I also explained 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; EVP to many people because I had a vision of how too do Ghostbox by flipping 
&gt; &gt; &gt;the 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; radio dial. I also explained:Â Songs can be used like Tarot cards! Anything can 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; speak to a person like the wind for example..
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides having visions I also used to sing songs on the radio years before they 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; came out. The news recorded me many times singing songs and warning of things 
&gt; &gt; &gt; before they happened. That&#x27;s how I got to do movie/rock star readings and 
&gt; &gt; &gt;warned 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; of things like 9/11 to politicians and put things in the media like &quot;The plane! 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The plane!&quot; on Fantacy Island. http://youtu.be/_xG7Qwv23sgÂ that would warn of 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the 9/11 terror attacks or actually warning of the conspiricy with-in and that 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; someone was doing something.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The 9/11 emergency phone number is also a warning of Â 9/11 terror attacks and 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the feeling someone was going to do something.
&gt; &gt; &gt; What I am saying isÂ I was there (in the 70&#x27;s)with the politicians in Canada 
&gt; &gt; &gt; warning of 9/11 to Americain politiciansÂ saying we would make the emergency 
&gt; &gt; &gt; phone number the same accross north America and what the number meant. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; We also spoke of the TV shows that warned of 9/11. Fantacy Island, SCTV and 
&gt; &gt; &gt;many 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; other tv shows or songs that would have a 9/11 feeling. SCTV is a great example 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; of thisÂ where all of Canada was saying &quot;Take-off eh. Like you know eh, you 
&gt; &gt; &gt; hosers you know.&quot; It even became a hit song. http://youtu.be/1BFPt001PYU Rush 
&gt; &gt; &gt; sang with the SCTV comediens Bob and Doug and it became a large part of a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Canadian&#x27;s identity, &quot;Like you know,eh?&quot;(a psychic expression like we all 
&gt; &gt; know)
&gt; &gt; &gt; I did this type of thing for many TV shows, movies, songs and politicians of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; many countries. I put my image in some of it and it shows too.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The whole time people have been trying to dismiss me, get me to loose me 
&gt; &gt; &gt; jobs,loose Â girlfriend and Â friends. And People tried to kill me. My 
&gt; &gt; &gt; ex-girlfriend said my baby it not mine and everyone believes her, so I lost my 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; kid!
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now I am a psychic forÂ adviser network.
