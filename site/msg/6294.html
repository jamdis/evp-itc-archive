Anyone know how to best get a minibox checked onto an international flight?  Handcarry would be best for me due to baggage problems in Mexico City.  Ron L

This issue comes out of the closet ever now and then so no biggie... 
If you review my website you'll see that the MiniBox is designed to 
put a device in peoples hands so that many people can do research 
with identical equipment, especially those who are not equipped to 
do RS hacks. The eBay venue is just that - a method to spread the 
word - the prices are fixed and the same everywhere, though if they 
are ordered through the website the shipping is free...

...We now take you back to our regularly scheduled program...
