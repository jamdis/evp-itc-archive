<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>C2C has really declined under Noory. I don&#x27;t dislike him, but he is no Art Bell. Art was a legend, but Noory is a tad too narcissistic for my taste, always seeking validation from guests that he has some superintuitive skill. Back in the Bell days, I usually listened most every night, because the guests were thought provoking and his interviewing style made the shows legendary. Noory unfortunately can have a brilliant guest lineup and still make the show a snoozer. 

I am rambling on, but I thought the segment was a good one, if not long enough. Hell they could have devoted the whole show to you and Bill and I would have been happy.
