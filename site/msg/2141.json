Their interests do not lie in the mechanism=\r\n of communication so much or gathering evidence to prove or disprove a theo=\r\nry. They are interested in the message and the connection we have with the =\r\nspirits we all have around us. Its how our own spirit (who we really are) c=\r\nonnects with the ones we are speaking with. \nEveryone has heard the term, &quot;=\r\nlike attracts like&quot;. This is a crude basis for resonance! Your spiritual pr=\r\nogress or rate of vibration determines what kind of etherial crowd you will=\r\n attract and hang out with. A lot of the viewpoints of investigators comes =\r\nfrom the belief that we are primarily physical beings. This is an automatic=\r\n belief because of the conditioning and programming we have received by our=\r\n societies all our lives. What the spirits have been telling us for thousan=\r\nds of years in scriptures, spiritual teachings, inspired philosophy and so =\r\non is that we are primarily spiritual beings. We are the &quot;ghost in the mach=\r\nine&quot;, not the machine.\n\nNow, I know many of you who actually take the time =\r\nto read all this will try to write these words off as some kind of personal=\r\n belief of mine or a unsupported philosophy. In fact everything I have just=\r\n stated is supported by 30 years of messages received from the 70&#39;s to the =\r\npresent through ITC contacts all over the world.\n\nSo to validate your belie=\r\nf Bill, yes it very much depends on the person who is recording the EVP! ;)=\r\n\n\nRegards,\n\nFrank R.\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: psi_research &lt;vilhe=\r\nllm@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thursday, September 20=\r\n, 2007 12:28:29 AM\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] Re: EVP Experiment planned in October=\r\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n            One of the reasons I believe the researche=\r\nr is often part of the\n\nprocess is because some investigators seem to be ab=\r\nle to consistently\n\nobtain evp&#39;s while others are not, despite many attempt=\r\ns over years of\n\ninvestigating.

As a &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; matter of fact we had an EVP when we reentered the house &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sayin=\r\ng, &quot;here they come, lets go&quot;. I don&#39;t necessarily understand &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; why =\r\na ghost or spirit would talk with no one present to receive the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; m=\r\nessage unless during setup you explained what you are trying to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a=\r\nccomplish and what the spirits roll is in the experiment (we never &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; tried explaining). A piece of machinery (recorders) in an empty room &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; does not have a consciousness or spiritual presence I would be &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; interested to see if you get different results.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt;   ----- Original Message ----&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: delchay2005 &lt;azred=\r\nant@&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;ma=\r\nilto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSent: Tuesday, September 18, 2007 6:47:24 PM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-IT=\r\nC] EVP Experiment planned in October.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;     To t=\r\nry and rule out that the EVP researchers are imprinting &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; voices &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; psychokinetically on audio players mistaken as ghosts voices, =\r\nI &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; will &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; pre-tape an interactive evp session.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I will record a bank of thirty questions, 20 seconds=\r\n of silence &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; after each question, on a cassete tape and playe=\r\nd on a cassette &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; player that will be utilized in all three bu=\r\nildings in a known &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; haunted location just outside of Phoenix,=\r\n Arizona.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There will be digital recorders, cas=\r\nsette recorders, omni &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; directional microphones, condensor mic=\r\nrophones, as well as an &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; electrocet boom microphone present i=\r\nn all of the sessions. There &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; will be no human agents in the =\r\nbuildings when these sessions take &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; place.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; My hope is to:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Record an authentic =\r\nEVP with no human agent in the building. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If t=\r\nhis is phenomena driven, will the phenomena communicate by &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; r=\r\nesponding to questions from a machine rather than a human agent? &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you have any ideas to enhance this experiment, pleas=\r\ne feel free &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to let me know.
