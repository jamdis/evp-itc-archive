The fact is you can never trust the recording whether it is an EVP or Fran=
k's Box or a picture of a UFO. =C2=A0You can only trust or not trust the so=
urce.
Days after the first photo, people were doctoring them. =C2=A0Same wi=
th audio.
That is why I'm more interested in things I gather myself and I r=
eally don't care if anyone else hears the same thing or believes me that I =
did not modify it.
I do it for my own purposes, not to convince others.
