I have tested all of the devices out there, Ron. I could take reams of paper
her to explain what I received. The issue is, with so many things normal
that it can be, the task is proving what it is. If you haven't used RF
spectrum analyzers, signal tracers, and RF field strength meters to
eliminate the probable causes, then it doesn't matter what claim is made.
You can't prove it. With Spiricom, for example, the Ghost of 29 MHz could
just have easily been a truck on a CB radio, as they cover the same
bandwidth. Every RF band out there has activity, of the living human
variety. In fact, most of the bands are choked with traffic. Personally,
since EVP can be captured without any of this technology, I find it
difficult to buy into RF being a tool, since we require special electronics
to create it and communicate with it. Having also analyzed EMF and EVP
simultaneously and found them to be related, I have a tougher time with it.
We don't speak using radio frequencies. It would be common sense to believe
if we ream conscious after to death at a pure energy state, we wouldn't
radiate at that frequency either. We would modulate in the audio spectrum of
our voice, and that seems to be where all the viable evidence is leading.
Thus it makes more sense to me that a real ghost talking device would use
the same methodology, such as modulating EMF to the voice. It is simple to
do and everyone can afford it, as well as it takes no special proprietary
instrumentation to do it. All you need is a mic, an amp and a speaker. You
are not only creating sound, but a matching EMF field at the same time.
 
People have different motivations, and different beliefs. I have always
approached it from a scientific aspect, and it has served me well. I don't
expect anything, instead I wait to be surprised. Objective research is the
key. Now if people need to believe in it, that is fine too, but beliefs are
different from this is what it does. The truth is it may be possible that
this can communicate with something, possibly aliens or inter-dimensional
creatures, but we have no way to prove it due to everything else it can be.
This is precisely why a handful of researchers and scientists have started
looking at this stuff seriously. It is also why I am here. I want to learn
as much as I can from the methods, devices and how they are being used in
order to duplicate the work in a controlled environment, with equipment
monitoring the equipment and the users. That my friend, reveals far more
than you would imagine.
