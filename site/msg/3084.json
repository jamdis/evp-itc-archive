As all on this board one way or another would \nhave \n&gt; done anything to get their hands on one of Frank&#39;s boxes or \n&gt; something equivalent.  So, now it&#39;s your chance to get another \n&gt; version of an already great idea and everyone&#39;s complaining.  Isn&#39;t \n&gt; this the answer to everyone&#39;s problem, it may be pricey but i know \n&gt; people who would have paid more in the past for a similar item.  \n&gt; This board is for research, this is just another idea just like \n&gt; Joe&#39;s idea of joe&#39;s box and frank&#39;s &quot;frank&#39;s box&quot;.  If this version \n&gt; doesn&#39;t work, than the idea will kill itself.  But, now people can \n&gt; get to see if they are truly meant to work with the other side or \n&gt; one of the 30 or 80 or whatever the number is up to now.  I think \nif \n&gt; you don&#39;t like this minibox than don&#39;t buy it, but isn&#39;t anybody \n&gt; curious to see the results people get with it or don&#39;t.  Just my \n&gt; take on it, i think it&#39;s crazy that everyone is getting so upset \n&gt; about another form of communication.  It took me back at first \n&gt; because i felt this would kill my research, but we don&#39;t know if \n&gt; this even works yet.  These things happen for a reason by stuff out \n&gt; of our control.  All we can do is sit back and watch, and who \ndidn&#39;t \n&gt; think someone was going to mass produce this idea eventually \n&gt; anyway?  \n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n      Hi Steve H., My thoughts are if the boxes DO work well for \nthose that are truely interested in doing research with them - \ndaily!! I&#39;d still like to experience one, but am in L.A. - where no \none&#39;s doing Public demos of it = UGH! Chris -who was in San diego \ntoday wants $125. for the admission!! Yikes!     =Judy="}
