<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Welcome, Gan!  Your story sounds so very interesting, I would love to hear more about the stuff you&#x27;re getting.  If you can post the files (not sure how you go about that, as I haven&#x27;t done so myself yet), I would love to hear them; I would also like to hear a description of your experiences so far (in case I can&#x27;t open your files, which happens to me sometimes) -- are the messages seemingly from people you&#x27;ve known, or have names been provided by the entities you&#x27;re speaking to?  What sort of things are they saying?

It&#x27;s my understanding that, usually, the entities speak only in a language that you can understand, supposedly because YOU are an active participant in creating the messages (albiet unconsciously).  If you speak English, you can get messages in English.

If you have the time, I&#x27;d love to hear anything you&#x27;d be interested in sharing with us.

Jill

&gt; Hello Folks,
&gt; I&#x27;m from chennai, india and have been experimenting evp for past couple of days actively.To my surprise, i can kind of make out the voices in english as well as my native language tamil. I am looking forward to explore, share and learn more from the experienced folksin the group.
&gt; For now, i&#x27;m using audacity in mac for recording (at 00 hrs as i&#x27;ve felt the timingperfectly good for silence and concentration). For processing i use soundtrack pro withwavearts noise + hum au effects to clean, boost, polish the track.
&gt; I&#x27;m looking forward for your knowledge and ideas.
&gt; P.S: Is it ok to send the mp3 to the group for analysis ?
&gt; Thanks,Gan.
