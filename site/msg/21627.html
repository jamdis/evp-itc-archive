I=
 was just sent an e-mail from the Andy Coppock camp, so i must retract my e=
arlier posts.

Although i had good reason to feel that i was taken for a ri=
de, that does not seem to be the case. Andy was apparantly bombarded with p=
robes to modify and mine was in the batch with the rest.

I also was inform=
ed that this probe that i modified myself is an older model of what Andy us=
ed to use, but he no longer does.

They offered to make good on my lost dev=
ice, which makes them top notch in my book and i no longer feel taken advan=
tage of. 

I look forward to seeing their new work and devices some day.
