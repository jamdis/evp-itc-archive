Hi Everyone :)

I'm new to the group, but not to ITC or EVP. I had taken a =
break from it for awhile and of course I can't stay away for too long. 

I =
will be getting a camcorder in hopefully tomorrow. I had one, but it was ol=
d and broke. (VHS kind) I am looking forward to the newer digital one. 

I =
have tried the EVP Maker for EVP and pretty good results. Today was the fir=
st time using it. I posted them up on my page: http://www.roscoeparanormal.=
com/evp.html
I am hoping to obtain a RS radio to minipulate, but they are s=
old out here and online.

I am very much enjoying all the EVP posted though=
!!

Heather
