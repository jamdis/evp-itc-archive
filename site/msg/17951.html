<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The only conclusion I have so far is that providing a raw material for the
entities to form their voices from seems to make the communication possible.
Any raw audio will work, but it seems to make it easier if there&#x27;s bits of
speech present. EVPmaker provides those bits of speech, and sweeping a radio
across it&#x27;s tuning range is a convenient source of speech bits. You can also
use crown noise, fan noise, running water noise, wind noise--any noise that
has sound that the human ear can perceive. You can use a foreign language
you don&#x27;t understand as the raw audio.

 Yeah, radio by itself, as in just a carrier wave would do nothing for
spirit communication, it&#x27;s only when the radio signal is demodulated in a
receiver to provide the bits of speech music and noise that it becomes
useful in spirit communication. Just one method of many to provide the raw
audio.

&gt;  Raymond Bayless was getting recorded spirit voices back in the 1950&#x27;s.
&gt;
&gt; While his best known work was with von Salazy on audio tape, Bayless
&gt;
&gt; also received voices using an early grammophone-style recording device.
&gt;
&gt; In other words, he was using strictly a mechanical recorder. This would
&gt;
&gt; suggest that the voices may not require electronics at all. And that would
&gt;
&gt; imply that radio signals may have nothing to do with the voice reception.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Consider too that EVPMAKER sessions seem to work well for some people.
&gt;
&gt; Except for the mechnical recordings, which are few in number, all the
&gt;
&gt; current techniques have electronics in common. So it would make sense
&gt;
&gt; that electronics might be important to the process. However, when
&gt;
&gt; you factor in the mechanical recordings made using devices prior to
&gt;
&gt; modern electronics, it seems more sensible to look for a common
&gt;
&gt; explanation which involves environmental manipulation. The most reasonable
&gt;
&gt; thing we know of that meets this criterion is mind-matter interaction,
&gt;
&gt; or psychokinesis (PK).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The only remaining question then, aside from the actual source of the
&gt;
&gt; information which cannot be objectively ascertained as of yet, is whether
&gt;
&gt; a single or multiple mechanisms are indeed at work. Even though radio waves
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; are not required to produce the phenomena, if multiple mechanisms are at
&gt; work,
&gt;
&gt; it may be that radio waves are one of many ways the phenomena is produced.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Bottom line, with so many options much more information is needed to form
&gt; any
&gt;
&gt; reasonable hypothesis.
