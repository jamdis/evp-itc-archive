It only gets better!  Wait until your in the store and can hear the peoples conversation 2 isles over, mixed in the the rest of the people.  Its a constant scan over and over again!  I feel like one of those nosey neighbors hearing things I shouldn't, LOL.
   
  I already own a straight jacket, so I guess I'm set!

heightened to the point of hearing conversations when you are alone? 
Or seeing things more clearly spirit wise? Or am I just nuts and need
to be committed? 

I had to ask. It's a very strange thing. These things have been
happening to me and I'm wondering if you have experienced the same
thing or close to it.
