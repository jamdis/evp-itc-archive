"....turning more toward the spiritual (whatever your definition of that is), would be a basic goal..."

You are correct throughout your post with the above quote being the most relevant.

            This is my two cents regarding the box and the "spread" of it.



I would think the goal would be to get people experimenting with it 

as much as possible.  There are always going to be people who shoot 

it down, attack, etc., but you will find others who experiment with 

it, or embrace it, as well.  Nothing that is new (or old) will ever 

be exempt from the attack of others, unless of course one keeps it 

hidden in a closet.



With this type of ITC, it is ground-breaking IMHO, as the box is 

providing an avenue to "open up the minds" of those whose time has 

come to "hear."  In other words, I suspect that only a given amount 

of people will be open to it; and that will be their time to explore 

the boxes and make contact with spirit.  That is the goal I would 

think: more belief by the populus and especially connection to the 

unseen, whatever that may be.



I just received a nasty e-mail from a TAPS lover attacking Angels & 

Ghosts because I have written some articles with respect to their 

shoddy review of the Shadow Man pic at Moundsville (I am not dogging 

TAPS here).  I simply felt what was done by the TV show to the lady 

who took the image was wrong.  I also was attacked as to some of the 

EVPs on Angels & Ghosts as being "faked."  We receive submissions 

from all over the world and post those that are of interest (photos, 

videos, evp, stories, etc).  The only goal of the site is to post 

that which might cause others to consider the existence of spirit - 

the existence of more beyond the physical realm. Of course, we don't 

try to post that which we know was faked.  Again pointing others to 

connect spiritually is the idea. 



Is that not what the boxes will be first used for?  I could see many 

people split on this, but the idea of turning more toward the 

spiritual (whatever your definition of that is), would be a basic 

goal.  From there, everyone must have their own personal experience 

to become a believer, no matter how good the evidence posted from 

anyone experimenting with ITC.
