I would try it both ways -solo and with another person. However I would lim=
it it to just me and one other trustworthy person.

Only after establishing that I =

 Well, if my husband would let me actually experiment with one, that would =
be the first step LOL!

  But what I would try and do is get some kind of v=
erifiable information from the "entity" that I contact with the board to pr=
ove that it is communication from an actual, intelligent being and not just=
 my own motor responses making he planchette move. It would have to be info=
rmation that I have no knowledge of.

  If I could do that, and consistentl=
y, then I would be comfortable saying that I am actually talking to a spiri=
t.

  The reason I have my doubts is that you have to be touching the planc=
hette to get it to move. If it were an actual spirit, I would think that sh=
ouldn't be necessary. We all know ghosts can a do move objects.

  But this=
 brings up another mystery - if the Ouija board is actual spirit communicat=
ion, maybe there is a difference between the entities you can contact with =
it and your common ghost.

    When it comes to the Ouija, I just want=
 to study it to find out if it is really spirit communication, or just kine=
tic energy or your subconscious mind moving the planchette.

    I agree th=
at we all have the ability for extra sensory perception, just some are bett=
er at it than others. Like running, for instance. We all can run, but some =
are naturally better at it. Still, with practice we can get better.

    Bu=
t that is not my aim with the Ouija.

      You forgot yawn =
from boredom, that's what I do.
       
      Use it, don't use it.  I don'=
t care.  But why bother.  When people ask me I usually suggest that if they=
 want to communicate with ... whatever why not develop the ability yourself=
.  - ya, I'm one of those who believe anyone can.
       
      There's alw=
ays the question in the back of your mind whether your partner's moving it.=
  The intentions of "what" you are talking to.  Not to mention it's too slo=
w and limited.
       
      Besides if you take the time to develop the ab=
ility you can get more texture in the information.  Asking the board "where=
 you married?" may get you a "yes" but a psychic might get the sense of a r=
eligious or civil ceremonhy, the garment(s) worn, other's in the party, or =
whether that Being approved/disapproved of their spouse (ie was it a reluct=
ant union).
