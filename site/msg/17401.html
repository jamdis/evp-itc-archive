&gt; Frank,

&gt; Very interesting. It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve listenend to your files. The
&gt; fm on this tuner sounds really active; the Others are definitely chatty on
&gt; this band.
&gt;
&gt; This is what I hear (in studio grade headphones):
&gt;
&gt; Your AM file @ 03 secs: &quot;Here Prin Cess&quot; (male + two escalating tones)
&gt; @ 11 secs: &quot;Be sure (static) good news&quot; (male)
&gt;
&gt; Your FM file @ 01 secs: &quot;Trying to get through&quot; (in female tones)
&gt; @ 03 secs: &quot;It don&#x27;t ?boost? right&quot; (male then two tones)
&gt; @ 05 secs: &quot;Closer to cooperating?&quot; (male, first vowel sound is hard and
&gt; second vowel sound in this word is a soft &#x27;a&#x27; or &#x27;o&#x27; so it cannot be
&gt; calamity)
&gt; @ 06 secs: &quot;Till we&#x27;re done&quot; (female, fast)
&gt; @ 08 secs: &quot;Frank&quot; (male)
&gt; @ 09 secs: &quot;Hi&quot; (female singing, drawn out)
&gt; @ 11 secs: &quot;How you doing&quot; (male)
&gt; @ 14 secs: &quot;Hi&quot; (female or child)
&gt;
