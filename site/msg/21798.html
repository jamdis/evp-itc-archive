<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Group,

I don&#x27;t usually comment on this kind of thing but it&#x27;s getting kind of depressing.  And I won&#x27;t be saying any more than this on the subject.

I just spent half an hour reading through the Amy Winehouse 4 posts  What I&#x27;m not getting here is why some of these discussions devolve into attacks.  This is a forum for airing knowledge and posting GBC materials regarding EVP-ITC.  If one disagrees with another person regarding religious beliefs or postings it can be done in a way that is respectful.  What I&#x27;m reading seems mostly like pent up resentment and disagreements in the form of attacks.  Constructive criticism  is a great way to air different opinions on a subjects.  Attack mode is just negative.  I may be guilty of chatting and joking around and probably shouldn&#x27;t, but I am alarmed at how personal this stuff gets.

I wish we could all be respectful of other&#x27;s beliefs and constructive in our criticism.  This kind of attack mode stuff doesn&#x27;t really seem to be doing much for the advance of EVP-ITC research though, if done in an appropriate and respectful manner, it probably would.  This is just my opinion and I&#x27;m not targeting anyone in particular.

Please, try to be a little more constructive or take what you need and leave the rest.

Regards,

Adrienne</pre>
