Thank you, Frank!  There you have it!  The last time I checked, =
the U.S. of A. was a "Capitalist" country...! That simply means making or b=
uying wholesale a product that will retail for more money than was invested=
 thus making a Profit.  You want an example?  You just have to look at Thom=
as Edison and Nickola Tesla.  Both were brilliant men,  pioneers in their f=
ield,  which was basically the same for both.  One was more brilliant than =
the other,  in turn the less brilliant "stole" ideas and products from the =
other.  The most brilliant was not a "Capitalist",  he devoted his time and=
 efforts to "bettering the lives of mankind".  The lessor was indeed a "Cap=
italist",  his motives were less noble,  however,  and he was willing to "b=
etter" mankind,  too,  but make a good profit in the process.  We all know =
the story...one is foremost in the eyes of the general public,  became pers=
onally rich and famous,  while the other died broke and without fanfare.  A=
 shame,  but factual,  none-the-less.  Would you work for free?  Would you =
supply people with something they want without recompense?  I think not.  I=
 certainly wouldn't!  Get real.  Bruce is going to post a capture, he says,=
 from Nickola Tesla.  I predict that it will be a warning... "Don't Do What=
 I Did!  Make a Profit!"    --Rod
