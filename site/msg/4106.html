Mike,
 
The way your explaining this procedure it sounds more like traditi=
onal evp recordings
and not real time communication. are you hearing anythi=
ng real time?

Actually=
... the output from the amplified microphone is plugged into the mic input =
of the recorder and also Y-ed to a set of earphones. The 12-470 sweeping ra=
w audio comes out of the 12-470 speaker as does the white noise come out of=
 the speaker from that device. Both units sound are fed into the chamber wh=
ere they mix with any ambient noise, then the amp mic picks it up, feeds it=
 to the recorder which records it. I could have just used the built-in mic =
on the recorder but the amp mic adds a little better tone, also you could h=
ave the recorder outside the case if you want, which would be a more ideal =
thing if you use a larger recorder or a tape recorder. That way the motor n=
oise would not mix inside the chamber.- Mike--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,=
