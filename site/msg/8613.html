Yes that was what intrigued me the most about it. Interesting stuff!

&gt; Hi Misty,
&gt; 
&gt; yes, but as mentioned in the article, the soundwaves engraved in 
smoke
&gt; on paper were never intended to be played at that time. So it was
&gt; actually in best a preliminary stage to the phonograph. In most 
cases,
&gt; inventions don&#x27;t fall from the sky, and of course it seems very 
likely
&gt; that Edison had already heard of the &quot;phonautograph&quot; before he 
developed
&gt; his phonograph.
&gt; 
&gt; Stefan
&gt; 
&gt; -- 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yeah it makes one wonder. Then again this country not to mention 
the 
&gt; &gt; world as a whole has always been on the brink of new technology 
which 
&gt; &gt; they either cover up or covet to the point others rarely know of 
its 
&gt; &gt; existence. I wonder what else is laying around that was invented 
that 
&gt; &gt; nobody knows about or told others about. I found the smoke thing 
&gt; &gt; interesting tho. Never would have thought of that one so I was 
amazed 
&gt; &gt; that someone else did so long before edisons work became the 
&gt; &gt; forefront of technology. Considering the time frame it makes me 
&gt; &gt; ponder if he had heard of the work or just the idea even was 
enough 
&gt; &gt; to set his wheels turning and get him thinking in that direction.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Misty,
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; yeah, fascinating; however, I wonder why mechanical audio 
recording 
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; reproduction techniques haven&#x27;t been invented much earlier, 
since 
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; technical principle behind that is actually quite 
straightforward. I
&gt; &gt;&gt; could easily imagine that someone like Leonardo da Vinci could 
have
&gt; &gt;&gt; invented such a machine...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I ran across this tonight while surfing the web and found it 
&gt; &gt; interesting.
