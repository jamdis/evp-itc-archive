Frank, I think you misunderstood or misread something somewhere. The AAEVP/=

p>Frank, I think you misunderstood or misread something somewhere. The AAEV=
P/Sarah Estep Research Fund is not for AAEVP to do the research, it's for t=
hem to fund OUTSIDE organizations for THEIR scientific research on the stud=
y of EVP. The Windbridge Institute received some of this sponsor money for =
what they called "Real-time EVP Conversations: A Pilot Study." The method f=
or this communication was *not* based on radio sweep, nor traditional metho=
ds, so it's not based on what I assume many people here are doing. And in f=
act, it *was* based on the creations of someone outside of the USA, so I'm =
a little confused as to why all the hostility toward AAEVP for putting up t=
he money.<br>
<br>Sadly, radio sweep methods don't, and may not for a long =
time, get the respect of the scientific community that it deserves (then ag=
ain, seems no form of EVP does), but at least this current research is a st=
ep in the right direction. I hope, when Windbridge concludes their study, t=
hat it will support the notion that there is apparent communication formed =
in ways that cannot be explained by currently known and understood laws of =
nature. THAT alone, in my opinion, would be a big plus for all ITC communit=
ies, regardless of the method from which that communication was received. W=
hat's the old saying? "It takes but one white crow to prove all crows are n=
ot black." Any proof, derived from any EVP method, would be greatly welcome=
d as far as I'm concerned.<br>
