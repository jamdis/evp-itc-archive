<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes it is.  To greatly simplify things, motions within motions in and of 
space (or spacetime, if you will) cohese to form larger patterns we call 
energy.  Energy coheses and condenses to form denser patterns we call 
matter or mass.

Condensed space becomes energy. Dispersed matter becomes energy. There are 
many ways of accomplishing this.

All that article is describing is the patterns.  It doesn&#x27;t mention the 
content or structure of the patterns.

Also, the last sentence of the article is not completely true.  I&#x27;m sure 
Frank and a few others around who are radio amateurs or are familiar with 
the phenomena of propagation know about things like sporadic-E clouds and 
tropospheric ducting which enable signals in the FM spectrum (88 to 108 
MHz) and even higher frequencies to propagate long distances.  I made a 
microwave radio contact over a 470 mile path on the frequency of 10368 
MHz (microwave) with 2 watts and a small (20-inch) dish antenna a few 
weeks ago. Something called &quot;knife-edge diffraction&quot; is also fun to play 
with, where the radio signals can be made to diffract over the tops of 
buildings and mountains for long-distance contacts. We&#x27;ve had lots of fun 
with this over the tops of Chicago skyscrapers in the past, too.
