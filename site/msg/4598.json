The \namplified speakers are from OEM Electronics here in town.  They have \ntons of used parts, of all sorts.  It&#39;s a place the size of a grocery \nstore with aisles and aisles of used electronics stuff. Sets of used \nspeakers go for around $10.\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;judy_in_hollywood&quot; \n&lt;Ticket_to_Heaven@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Okay... I got a brand-spanking new audio mixer today for $8, so I \njust \n&gt; &gt; had to put a new Radio Shack Hack configuration together.\n&gt; &gt; See it here: http://ufogeek.com/?p=182\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;     . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    Hi Mike!  Wow! I really like the \n2 speakers & the small mixer you show on your photo!!  Where did you \nget/find the mixer (for $8) and the 2 speakers (how much)???  I have \na RS 12-469 that I hacked. I have &quot;El Cheap-o&quot; $1. dual speakers, but \nI have to put the dynamic mic right next to them + put the RS Hack \nvolume to max, to record! Not the greatest, but it works. Let me/us \nknow, thanks!!   8-))  =Judy=\n&gt;"}
