&gt; D&#x27;Ana-- this list is full of people doing two-way communication. 
You  
&gt; may want to google &quot;Frank&#x27;s box&quot; and do some reading to catch up 
to  
&gt; where we are.
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome  aboard.

&gt; &gt; it was where he was asking his dad somethionog that is all i
&gt; &gt; know regarding the one i listened to. that makes more sense though
&gt; &gt; for some odd reason there arent any others that have brought up 
two
&gt; &gt; way communication so im afraid i was wrong! Thanks for doin that 
for
&gt; &gt; me and bruce. I am glad there is other ways that specialize in
&gt; &gt; communicating with the deceased. i have no clue why i have never
&gt; &gt; heard of that but thanks for the heads up...tons of things 
everyone
&gt; &gt; isnt aware of.. so you answered the one i wanted
&gt; &gt; answered .

&gt; &gt; &gt; That isn&#x27;t his dad--it&#x27;s Mike, his guide.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; What you&#x27;re hearing are artifacts of the sound clean-up program
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; makes the voices more audible.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; These are not EVPs, they are realtime communication. They are
&gt; &gt; heard
&gt; &gt; &gt; out loud as they happen. That&#x27;s what boxes do--they allow two-
way
&gt; &gt; &gt; real-time exchange between us and them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now I am sure you arent aware of who I am being, noone else 
other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than misty welcomed me to this group. Being I am not 
professional
&gt; &gt; at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e.v.p.s but yet have gone through listening to many of them 
from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trustful resources, your e.v.p.s make me a bit leery. NOt 
trying
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be rude, so dont go get all upset right off the bat. In your
&gt; &gt; e.v.p.s,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this one especially, alot of them sound like you, not the part
&gt; &gt; where
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you asking questions, but where your dad is supposively 
answering
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you. NOw everyone has their own right to opinion so there is 
now
&gt; &gt; need
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get defensive, if all is real there would be nothing to 
get mad
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about. I just cant help but notice how odd it is that your 
e.v.p.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions to your father, seems to answer right away when you 
ask
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question. Also, i notice that after you ask the question i 
hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something being turned on that has contains the answer to that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question. Whether it be your dad or not. I feel its you that 
is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; answering, but let me tell you why i figure this.. and please 
you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would like to defend you side of things that would be great,
&gt; &gt; maybe i
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be able to change my opinion on the matter. But as of 
now,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e.v.p.s are usually done on the same tape that the questions 
are
&gt; &gt; on,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then in a rewind you can hear you and the e.v.p. but to me it
&gt; &gt; sound
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like you put the e.v.p. response on another tape. i am not 
trying
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; start any kind of fight or be cruel, maybe i could learn
&gt; &gt; something on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behalf of how you do your work... thank you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
