I put an attenuator on the output of the AM\n&gt;tuner, which helps.\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s the type of voices that gets to me sometimes, how many times to I have\n&gt;listen to crackhead aliens saying they&#39;re coming to pick up their Purple\n&gt;Princess!?  I think the purpose of EVP is make us nutz! Or maybe I need \n&gt;some\n&gt;of Art Bell&#39;s Gray Away Spray!?\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Tease your brain--play Clink!
