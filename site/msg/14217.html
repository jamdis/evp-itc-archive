Yeah I have had that a few times over the years. They usually use it as the=
 "name" for the entities speaking.
=A0
I asked another trooper tonight when=
 I had a chance she said that yes "signal" seven means a death. She also to=
ld me that some of the local police departments use a different system. The=
y also use the code 10-7 which means out of service. Pretty interesting any=
way.

True - except th=

Code 7 means thi=

he didnt know so he got on his radio and called in and asked them if it was=
 a 7 at the site. They told him negative, and he told me the little boy who=
 was the worst off was still alive. I asked him why did you ask them if it =
was a 7. He said code 7, I was asking them if they were dead. So if you eve=
r hear anyone call 7 over the radio that means someones dead.
=A0
Just thou=

e heard this before when used to describe who is speaking rather than a nam=
e they say seven.
