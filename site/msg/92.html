              Hi All;
  
   Well, I think it�s close enough to call the predictions I was getting a non event. Confusing this is, since I get trivial predictions that hit, but this big stuff, not! At first it�s tempting to throw the boxes at the wall and walk away from this stuff, but it�s just too damn intriguing to give up, and besides to give lets this deceptive, or lying element win. I don�t know what�s going on, but I have to keep plugging away at it, and as always not take it like it�s written in stone. I did have my doubts about these predictions, and that was probably my intuition trying to get through. 
  
  
   I keep my tape deck on the dresser, since I like to listen in the bathroom, one of the few quiet rooms in the house, and even this morning a little voice �Frank, it�s today�, and I think � but the day�s about over in England�. I guess, there�s a chance, but hopefully not!
  
   There was some information in these voices that didn�t add up. Like one said we were going through some of these rocks ( a meteor field) on Sunday, but that actually happened on Saturday, I think, cuz one did hit in Norway on the 10th, which I don�t accept as a hit by the guys. http://www.unknowncountry.com/news/?id=5347 
  
   Then the main voice I got that started all of this actually said the �16th�, but I don�t want to hold on to that saying �wait for it�, �wait for it�, �wait for it����forever!
  
   This stuff is so confusing!
