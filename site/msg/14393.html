Sounds like a little boy, says his name is Ralph, he said last name,  but i 
can't hear it, and his dad, i think. I asked if he use to live around  
here, I think he said, "yes."  If I could get his last name, perhaps I  could 
check this out more.  His father sounds young, if that is his dad, he  sounded 
like he was getting the little boy to speak up, because when he didn't  
respond right away to me, the man said, "ralph."  Then the boy said  something.
 
What do you guys hear?  Sure wish I had a box, maybe I could get  better 
sound from it, I think I am going to go deaf after trying to hear  these.sf
