<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think you&#x27;d be better served to try the simpler methods first, if those 
don&#x27;t work, chances are a box won&#x27;t either. I think almost everyone is 
basing their expectations of the boxes on Moon&#x27;s claims, which may be highly 
exaggerated. Besides, it&#x27;s not Like I can just throw this stuff together, 
despite Moon telling the world I give it away. I give away the proto types 
I&#x27;m done with, and don&#x27;t have any at the moment.

Many of the other methods work as well as my stuff, such as EVPmaker, the 
various direct radio voice methods.  They have a huge advantage--simple and 
cheap! I swear, all I do  is the same, provide a source of raw audio.

&gt;Mr. Sumption, I would like very much like to receive information as to 
&gt;acquiring one of your Boxes. I am a serious, independant Paranormal 
&gt;researcher, Not! a de-tractor of your instrument, not by any means. I 
&gt;mention this here because I&#x27;ve followed the various exchanges of 
&gt;information, and &quot;information,&quot; concerning your instrument. I&#x27;ve reviewed 
&gt;the sound bytes posted and am very impressed with the results. I would 
&gt;appreciate a responce, one way or the other, from you at your convenience. 
&gt;Thank you in advance.   --Rod

&gt;           I never paid much attention as to which boxes produced more 
&gt;negatives, but I
&gt;used to get alot when I first started this stuff. I tend to ignore those,
&gt;and sometimes if it&#x27;s in a segment I copy to the computer I&#x27;ll play it
&gt;backward. Reversed, sometimes the evil voices are angelic. That&#x27;s curious
&gt;about it shutting off aplliances, I thought those ran on internal 
&gt;batteries.
&gt;Maybe you&#x27;re getting a lesson in energies?
&gt;
&gt;I did get a quake warning in last nights test, it said China suffers a
&gt;quake, followed by August 11. I usually don&#x27;t get dates, or locations, so I
&gt;guess wait any see, of maybe they can evacuate China? Often, when a quake 
&gt;is
&gt;coming I get a wolf image, well there&#x27;s a wolf face on the shower window,
&gt;kind of a medium size wolf, so I think if there is a quake it won&#x27;t be real
&gt;severe, maybe like a 6 or 7. Wolves for quakes, cats for wind, and bears 
&gt;for
&gt;tsunamis, which I didn&#x27;t know ahead of time. For Katrina I had a cat(image)
&gt;with huge round eyes.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does anybody think it&#x27;s possible to get 2 extreme opposites in
&gt; &gt;communication? 1 Box curses at me constantly and tells me to die and
&gt; &gt;also talks about the end of the world and hell. And the other one
&gt; &gt;talks about how pretty it is there and i always get &quot;Hi&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt;Here&quot; as well as &quot;Don&#x27;t leave&quot; when i&#x27;m signing off and an
&gt; &gt;occasional &quot;Goodbye&quot;. Has anyone experienced anything like this
&gt; &gt;before? The 1 box even shuts off appliances in my house when i use
&gt; &gt;it, i guess i&#x27;ll stop using that one for now until i figure out a
&gt; &gt;solution to what&#x27;s going on. Any ideas?????
&gt; &gt;
