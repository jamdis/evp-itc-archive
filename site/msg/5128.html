Sumption sometimes uses them on his, and Ratka has been doing some other evp experiments with crystals. I myself have used quartz and gotten some nice itc images. Others have also done that. 
   
  For my own experiments not every quartz was active, I discovered that by doing a test using many different rocks/crystals and even tho many appear similar in shape size and definition some "turn on" some dont. It was easy to see which ones were active recievers and which were not. Some took longer to absorb the light and then flip on like a little tv (best way I can describe it) some were quicker to activate. And then there were those that did nothing. 
   
  They asked for me to use them for a long time but I didnt get it until I did what they asked and contacted someone whos name they kept mentioning for over a year. I didnt think she spoke english so I procrastinated (sorry) LOL. Just couldnt translate what I wanted to say. But then I heard she spoke english so no translator needed and contacted her. Once I did and shared my info with her she shared some info with me that made all those evp's make sense. Some of those results are in the gallery.
   
  Alot of people use quartz and other things to enhance thier methods. Best way to know what works is try it.

          Hi All, Just got an email from Mark Macy (Happy New Year, + info.) and read about quartz crystals being used for getting EVP's . . . . so was wondering IF anyone's used any with their boxes, yet? Results? =Judy=
