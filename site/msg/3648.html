<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce- Wow! That is a very bold statement, minus the name of the
person you are accusing (although it&#x27;s clear who you are referring to). 
I did read your apology for the negativity you&#x27;ve helped spread about
Christopher Moon. I acknowledge that your apology took a great deal of
humility. However, knee jerk reactions are exactly what I&#x27;ve been
talking about. People doing or saying without thought and consideration.

&gt; I think someone that stands to loose there bread and butter is making 
&gt; idle threats or having someone else do it. I would like to state for 
&gt; the record. SEND ME SOME DEATH THREATS YOU COWARD OR BETTER YET LETS 
&gt; SET UP A MEETING AND WE WILL SEE WHO IS LEFT FACE DOWN. 
&gt; 
&gt; Who ever you are you better hope I never find out, it&#x27;s a bitch when 
&gt; the hunter becomes the hunted!
&gt; 
&gt; If you got the balls contact me!
&gt; 
&gt; Sum don&#x27;t worry anyone that talks about doing something does only that 
&gt; TALK!
