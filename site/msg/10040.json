This impression was \n&gt; strengthened by the observation that the buzzing sound often was \neven \n&gt; modulated by O&#39;Neill&#39;s own voice during the dialoges between him \n&gt; and &quot;Dr. Mueller&quot;! (Did O&#39;Neill forget to remove the device from \nhis \n&gt; throat while talking to his counterpart?)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And what about the &quot;13 frequencies&quot; that are supposed to be used \nas \n&gt; the &quot;carrier&quot; for the spirit voices? Why aren&#39;t they audible in the \n&gt; recordings? And why does a mixture of the 13 tones created with \n&gt; Audition sound so different from the typical &quot;Spiricom buzz&quot;? - \nWell, \n&gt; if you analyze the frequency spectrum of the buzzing sound (this \ncan \n&gt; be done with Audition etc.), you will find a lot of harmonics \n(peaks \n&gt; in the spectrum), and some of these harmonics more or less match \nthe \n&gt; 13 Spiricom frequencies...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To me, the entire Spiricom saga produces more questions than \n&gt; answers...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- original Nachricht --------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Betreff: [EVP-ITC] Re: Spirico Device\n&gt; &gt; Gesendet: Fr, 18. Apr 2008\n&gt; &gt; Von: alexrondini&lt;alexrondini@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks Guy, I have heard a few people mention that O&#39;Neil \nhoaxed \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but I don&#39;t know enough about this to really pass any sort of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; judgement.  Looking forward to seeing your website.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Alex\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Guy&quot; &lt;yzzzguy@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In regards to the Spiricom story - I have to assume you&#39;re \n&gt; referring to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Mark IV model as diagrammed/written up in the Spiricom \n&gt; manual (as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opposed to the INCORRECT diagram made by Polish researcher \n&gt; Wojciech \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Drewniak...http://www.worlditc.org/k_06_spiricom.htm ).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While my research is still not finished (and I&#39;ve been \nworking \n&gt; on this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a little over 2 years), I&#39;m leaning toward the Mark IV \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conversations as having been hoaxed by Bill O&#39;Neil. HOWEVER - \nI \n&gt; believe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he acted alone and that none of the other members of the \n&gt; Metascience \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Foundation were involved with this hoax. As to O&#39;Neil&#39;s \n&gt; motivation for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the hoax - I still don&#39;t know. But I will also say that the \n&gt; veridical \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence that O&#39;Neil claims to have received about Dr. George \n&gt; J. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mueller through clairaudience is amazing and it is tough to \nsee \n&gt; how \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; O&#39;Neil would have gotten this information given his finances, \n&gt; location, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the timeframe, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been promising to get my personal website up and \noperating \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some time now but have been busy.
