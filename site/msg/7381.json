I organized this group in 1998, and have been in the\nresear=\r\nch of Ghost and Paranormal happenings ever since. I&#39;m the official\nparanorm=\r\nal researcher for the Stranahan House which is Fort Lauderdale&#39;s\noldest and=\r\n most haunted historical landmark. We have gotten many EVP&#39;s by\nuse of digi=\r\ntal recorder. There are 5 intelligent haunts that are in the\nhouse and one =\r\nresidual haunt outside of the house. Most of the evp work has\nbeen handled =\r\nby me, but I have been teaching some of my member to work their\nown recordi=\r\nngs.\r\n=20\r\nI am totally fascinated by your use of the &quot;Frank&#39;s Box&quot;. My congradulatio=\r\nns\nto your success, Frank and those who use the box on the research that yo=\r\nu&#39;ve\naccomplished. In this, I&#39;m also dissappointed by those who have used y=\r\nour\nbox to make money or notority to gain fame by it. I won&#39;t mention names=\r\n, to\nmention them will only give them more strength.=20\r\n=20\r\nWe are currently trying to do the Radio Shack hack of the 12-469 and hope =\r\nto\nbe successful in this trial by error. Hoping that our work will produce\n=\r\nsomething that we&#39;ve been trying to accomplish like you all have, two way\nc=\r\nommunication with astral beings. It&#39;s fustrating to do digital recordings\na=\r\nnd having to wait and sift through the recordings to get information. We\nho=\r\npe to elliminate that with the hack.\r\n=20\r\nAre Frank&#39;s boxes available for retail? I&#39;ve heard of the Mini Box that is=\r\n\ncoming out soon and they are taking pre-orders for this product. Our group=\r\n\nis small and we don&#39;t charge for our research at the historical landmarks\n=\r\nthat we do here in Fort Lauderdale, so we are looking for the best at the\nl=\r\nowest route approach.\r\n=20\r\nOur next project is a Historical Firehouse that is haunted by the ghost of=\r\n\nRobert Leland Knight. There is a mystery on how he died, but legend goes\nt=\r\nhat he fallen in a water puddle that was electricfied by a downed wire. He\n=\r\nwas a large man and a Golden Glove champ of Florida. It was his second week=\r\n\nof working at the firestation and he didn&#39;t have his gear because it had t=\r\no\nbe ordered. There is some who think (psychics) that he might have been\npu=\r\nshed out of the firetruck as a prank that went wrong.\r\n=20\r\nThis firehouse has had media play with the Sci-fi channel in a show called=\r\n \nProof Positive&quot;. The firestation is becoming a museum, and is allowing us=\r\n to\nspend the night in doing an investigation about Robert. There are some =\r\nwho\nbelieve that some of the haunt has to do with a hanging tree that was a=\r\nt the\nopposite corner of the Firestation. We are excited about doing an\ninv=\r\nestigation of this Historical Landmark, but are cautious of the fact that\nt=\r\nhere will be low level spirits/astral beings that might be present.\r\n=20\r\nFrank, If you have the time to answer me, that will be great. Those who ha=\r\nve\nthe &quot;Frank&#39;s box&quot;, if you can tell me how you obtained yours, that will =\r\nbe\nhelpful also. I would be greatful for any help at this point.\r\n=20\r\nThanks for letting me listen in on all of your discoveries and successes.\r\n=20\r\nBest Regards,\r\nJohn Marc Carr\r\nwww.sefgr.com\r\n=20\r\n=20\r\n \r\n--------------Boundary-00=_TURYZDM8WCW000000000\r\nContent-Type: Text/HTML;\n  charset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=\r\n=3Dus-ascii&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;IncrediMail 1.0&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;v&#92;=\r\n:* {\n\tBEHAVIOR: url (#default#vml)\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;v&#92;:* {\n\tBEHAVIOR: url =\r\n(#default#vml)\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;!--IncrdiXMLRemarkStart&gt;\n&lt;IncrdiX-Info&gt;\n&lt;X-FID&gt;7=\r\n9F8FDE2-E90C-4120-9A2C-E484CCFAA091&lt;/X-FID&gt;\n&lt;X-FVER&gt;&lt;/X-FVER&gt;\n&lt;X-FIT&gt;&lt;/X-FI=\r\nT&gt;\n&lt;X-FILE&gt;&lt;/X-FILE&gt;\n&lt;X-FCOL&gt;&lt;/X-FCOL&gt;\n&lt;X-FCAT&gt;&lt;/X-FCAT&gt;\n&lt;X-FDIS&gt;&lt;/X-FDIS&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;X-Extensions&gt;&lt;/X-Extensions&gt;\n&lt;X-BG&gt;cid:5D6E4F81-6B49-4F28-9260-7AC6CCE60B9=\r\n8&lt;/X-BG&gt;\n&lt;X-BGT&gt;repeat&lt;/X-BGT&gt;\n&lt;X-BGC&gt;#f3eded&lt;/X-BGC&gt;\n&lt;X-BGPX&gt;left&lt;/X-BGPX&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;X-BGPY&gt;top&lt;/X-BGPY&gt;\n&lt;X-ASN&gt;BCEB29C0-42D3-11D4-BA3E-0050DAC68030&lt;/X-ASN&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nX-ASNF&gt;0&lt;/X-ASNF&gt;\n&lt;X-ASH&gt;BCEB29C0-42D3-11D4-BA3E-0050DAC68030&lt;/X-ASH&gt;\n&lt;X-AS=\r\nHF&gt;1&lt;/X-ASHF&gt;\n&lt;X-AN&gt;A5BE2A00-37CC-11D4-BA36-0050DAC68030&lt;/X-AN&gt;\n&lt;X-ANF&gt;0&lt;/X=\r\n-ANF&gt;\n&lt;X-AP&gt;A5BE2A00-37CC-11D4-BA36-0050DAC68030&lt;/X-AP&gt;\n&lt;X-APF&gt;1&lt;/X-APF&gt;\n&lt;X=\r\n-AD&gt;601231A0-325F-11D4-BA2D-0050DAC68030&lt;/X-AD&gt;\n&lt;X-ADF&gt;0&lt;/X-ADF&gt;\n&lt;X-AUTO&gt;X-=\r\nASN,X-ASH,X-AN,X-AP,X-AD&lt;/X-AUTO&gt;\n&lt;X-CNT&gt;;&lt;/X-CNT&gt;\n&lt;/IncrdiX-Info&gt;\n&lt;IncrdiX=\r\nMLRemarkEnd--&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-POSITION: left top; SCROLL=\r\nBAR-FACE-COLOR: #c6d7ff; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px; SCROLLBAR-=\r\nHIGHLIGHT-COLOR: #ffffff; SCROLLBAR-SHADOW-COLOR: #ffffff; COLOR: #010158; =\r\nSCROLLBAR-3DLIGHT-COLOR: #7b9ed6; SCROLLBAR-ARROW-COLOR: #4a6184; BACKGROUN=\r\nD-REPEAT: repeat; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; SCROLLBAR-DARKSHADOW-COLOR: #bebebe&quot; =\r\ntext=3D#010158 vLink=3D#0000ff aLink=3D#0000ff link=3D#0000ff bgColor=3D#f3=\r\neded background=3Dcid:5D6E4F81-6B49-4F28-9260-7AC6CCE60B98 scroll=3Dyes SIG=\r\nCOLOR=3D&quot;11031552&quot;&gt;\n&lt;TABLE id=3DINCREDIMAINTABLE cellSpacing=3D0 cellPaddin=\r\ng=3D2 width=3D&quot;100%&quot; border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD id=3DINCREDITEXTREGION di=\r\nr=3Dltr style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; DIRECTION: ltr&quot; vAlign=3Dtop width=3D&quot;100=\r\n%&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Yikes I will just keep trying to&nbsp;make one.
