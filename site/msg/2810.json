People all over the world scream for proof but yet if=\r\n you ask them they cannot define what criteria they require for proof. Why?=\r\n Because they are so brainwashed in our societies materialistic teachings t=\r\nhey never expect to receive proof, so they don&#39;t even bother to define such=\r\n a criteria.\n\nIts amazing to me that a primarily spiritual creature such as=\r\n ourselves can deny our connections with that world and the source. The con=\r\nnections we experience everyday and at all times in the form of dreams, ran=\r\ndom thoughts and inspirations are so easily taken for granted and written o=\r\nff as figments of imagination, trivial thoughts and meaningless aspirations=\r\n. Even as a child I knew I was unique as was every person on the face of th=\r\ne planet. I knew that their were as many perspectives of reality as their w=\r\nere people to have them and that each and every one of them were just as va=\r\nlid as the other no matter how outlandish it seemed to me.\n\nAcceptance was =\r\ntaught to me instead of beliefs. Beliefs can enhance the truth but they are=\r\n not in themselves true.\n\nMore than I expected to write but I feel it is st=\r\nill valid,\n\nBest regards,\n\nFrank R.\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: Fran=\r\nk Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\nTo: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Mon=\r\nday, November 5, 2007 1:03:02 PM\nSubject: RE: [EVP-ITC] Nothin&#39;!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n =\r\n \n\n\n    \n            \n\n\n I&#39;m not really discouraged except by other people&#39;=\r\ns expectation, and use of the box.
