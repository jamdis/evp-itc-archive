So it could be something similar to 911, where everyone sees things differently after that point, but not necessarily a big explosion like that; it could be a change in human collective consciousness.  This is the sort of thing the Mayan scholars are saying will happen. \n\nBut I agree:  something is going to happen, even if it&#39;s subtle.\n\nJill\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ya have to keep in mind, it&#39;s not just a Mayan thing, this date is all over\n&gt; the world, in almost every culture. Besides I think there&#39;s going to be alot\n&gt; of debunking going, so anything the &quot;experts&quot; put out there would be suspect\n&gt; at best.\n&gt; \n&gt;  the date is based on the sun crossing the galatic center, and that happens\n&gt; in 2012. The original Mayan calendar builders, not the people there now,\n&gt; were not stupid, they could do all these calculations presumably without\n&gt; computers, show me one of these brainiac astronomers today that can do that.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  We&#39;re gonna get more and more of these experts proclaiming how it&#39;s all\n&gt; non-sense.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Nov 13, 2009 at 2:53 PM, DavidBR549 &lt;davidbr549@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Several years ago on the Discovery Channel they said that the Mayan\n&gt; &gt; calendar was baised on the orbit of Venus, if this is true 2012 has come and\n&gt; &gt; gone.

First, Strieber has no concept of how the Mayans\n&gt; &gt; could possibly have known anything, since we are supposed to be so much more\n&gt; &gt; advanced, and he thinks he is such a genius, but can&#39;t figure it out. The\n&gt; &gt; guy is frikkin&#39; idiot! The other &quot;expert&quot;, Bob Gleason, better, but still,\n&gt; &gt; basing everything on current knowledge. So the &quot;information&quot; on 2012 comes\n&gt; &gt; down to some crackhead&#39;s opinion, based on ego and nothing more.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  No wonder the stuff from the boxes is completely ignored by these people,\n&gt; &gt; they have no concept of spirit, or any other entities, and all information\n&gt; &gt; has to come from the likes of Strieber, Hoagland, and Howe. God almighty! I\n&gt; &gt; am totally disgusted. Noory is supposedly co-authoring a book on spirit\n&gt; &gt; communcation--yeah can&#39;t wait for that--the new house has a fireplace!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I know, I&#39;m ranting, but instead of providing a place to share information\n&gt; &gt; and insights, they make C2C a place to manipulate any facts that may exist,\n&gt; &gt; and subtly debunk almost everything. I think it&#39;s just another corporate\n&gt; &gt; mouthpiece. They don&#39;t want to the  masses seeking out the hidden bunkers\n&gt; &gt; supposedly being perpared by the elite few--just a gues as to the why of\n&gt; &gt; disinformation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  It would be easy to disregard one culture coming up with the date in 2012,\n&gt; &gt; but the whole damn world!? I think it might be wise to pay attention. That\n&gt; &gt; fact is conveniently ignored by these Mayan experts presenting their gospel\n&gt; &gt; opinions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  This normally would not be EVP related, except I get that wormworm/comet\n&gt; &gt; junk from the boxes almost every session.  The last three short recordings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;wormwood comes,-- wormwood, --wormwood... That&#39;s the big comet from the\n&gt; &gt; bible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Frank-s\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
