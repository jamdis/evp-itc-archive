I have the 469 hack, as\nwell as an Olympus WS-110 digital recorder, and a mic. I am trying to\nconfigure my system to allow me to record not only my voice, but the\nhack at the same time. I ran a y-adapter from the mic input on the\nOlympus to the 469 as well as a mic. Now when I record, the mic does\nnot record, only the 469. The mic acts as a speaker. What am I doing\nwrong here? I don&#39;t have an audio input on my laptop, just a built in\nmic. Any suggestions?"}
