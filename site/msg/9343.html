<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>;-) Rees.  I have to be careful when I start thinking about having fun.  It usually involves 
the prior curiosity &quot;I wonder what would happen if I tried.....&quot;  It&#x27;s a miracle that to date, 
I&#x27;ve not set anything on fire, damaged any of my equipment, or zapped the cr@p out of 
myself on something.  LOL.

Thanks for the compliment on my ITC images.  I kinda miss working on that, but I&#x27;m all 
caught up in the two-way stuff for the moment.  Glad to read that I&#x27;m not the only person 
losing sleep around here!!

&gt;   I just playing with you, I didn&#x27;t mean nothing bad.  I know you like all forms of real time 
spirit comminucation, and also your water videos (which I think are great, and i think the 
newbies should check out your site).  I just need to have some fun lately!

&gt;           Hi Rees. What is said, and still maintain this opinion, is: 
&gt; 
&gt; My best (clearest, longest, most meaningful) responses have come via the manual radio 
&gt; sweep technique. My next favorite is the MiniBox. Third on my list of preferences is the 
&gt; hacked Radio Shack models. This is not to say I do not like them, but I like them least. 
&gt; 
&gt; This also does not mean that I&#x27;m not open to experimenting with another model (I 
&gt; currently own both the old and new 469&#x27;s and the old 470&#x27;s, so I have based my opinion 
&gt; on experience and not just uninformed bias).
&gt; 
&gt; I would place EVP Maker with the allophones file ahead of the shack hacks as well, but I 
&gt; don&#x27;t consider that method to be among the &#x27;radio sweep&#x27; methods for comparison.

&gt; &gt; I though you didn&#x27;t like RSGhost Boxes, I knew you would come around, kinda like 
&gt; when I said I would never buy a Mini Box, and now I&#x27;m in the market to buy one of those 
&gt; too.lol

&gt; &gt; Oh noooooo, Kay and Jeff. I&#x27;m having a vision that making another purchase at 
&gt; Radio 
&gt; &gt; Shack is in my near future. ROFLOL. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Looking forward to hearing some 820 examples once they start coming through for 
you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The diffence between the 12-820 and new 12-469 is amazing. There is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; no clicking what so ever on either band. The Am band is so quiet I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; had to look at the radio to make sure it was still sweeping! I tried 
&gt; &gt; &gt; it out this morning for a bit but didnt get anything. I hope they 
&gt; &gt; &gt; like the new radio.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the update, Kay. I&#x27;ve also noticed varying sweep times 
&gt; &gt; &gt; between AM &amp; FM on other 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; models. Not sure if the actual rate of sweep differs, for just 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the amount of channels there is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be swept on one band versus another, so it takes longer to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; complete one full cycle.
