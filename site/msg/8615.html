Not bringing anyone down here! If it were all in your head then you 
can put over half this group on the cookoo list with ya and I&#x27;d be 
right at the top of the list in the straightjacket =) I think you 
will find most here have lost someone. Some more recently than 
others. Some more pained by thier loss than anyone can imagine. Often 
its the inspiration for taking notice of whats important in life and 
where we go afterwards. I find the work very comforting and very 
educational. Ive lost too many to count but now I only grieve for 
myself, mourn my own feeling of loss because I know they still exist 
and they are still around. Just in a different fashion than I was 
used to.

&gt; LK - thank you!  You&#x27;re sweet to say that..  I didn&#x27;t mean to bring 
the
&gt; board down.. I just found my clips fascinating.  I really feel like 
I was
&gt; talking to Aly - my 17 year old nice.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I hope it wasn&#x27;t in my head!  Many of you heard my clips the way I 
did or
&gt; something really close to what I heard so that is kinda cool for me!
&gt; 
&gt; Hugs back,

&gt; 
&gt; Oh, Kristin. I&#x27;m SO sorry to read of your loss. That is awful. I 
think it is
&gt; strange how grief 
&gt; can whip back on us, sometimes seemingly out of the blue, as if no 
time has
&gt; passed. Once in 
&gt; a while, for no apparent reason, I will have one of those days 
where it just
&gt; brings me to my 
&gt; knees, even after years. Four months is not a long time at all and 
it is
&gt; perfectly 
&gt; understandable how your grief could be so raw in this moment.
&gt; 
&gt; Sending big &#x27;feel better&#x27; hugs your way!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Margaret

&gt; &gt; As many of you know I lost both my niece and my nephew about 4 
months
&gt; &gt; ago. I was doing fine but this morning was rough. I spent time
&gt; &gt; talking to their mom and I sorta lost it after. I did a session 
and
&gt; &gt; the clips are from that. Look for them in a a few..
