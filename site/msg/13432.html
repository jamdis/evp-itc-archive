        guess, so =
I used to have a blast with the itcs but after some of the exeriences I hav=

            <BR>> <BR>> I have =
to admit that I thought I had seen the

how on television already. I was wrong. Door

xceeded<BR>my worst expectations.<BR>> 
             <BR>> Gener=
ally, I respect John Oliver's work as a medium. 
            While I have n=
o<BR>personal experience with him, in the past he has 
            looked a=
nd acted more<BR>genuine than not, the rolling of the eyes 
            put=
 aside for the moment.<BR>>  <BR>> I do take exception 
        =
    to the characterization of the talking box as an<BR>Edison device. I 
 =
           have documented the history of Edison, ITC 
            and<BR>E=
VP  elsewhere. This is however the smallest 
            concern =
I have with this<BR>show.<BR>>  <BR>> Prior to 
            wath=
cing I had just had a conversation with a respected<BR>colleague 
         =
   on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena he and<BR>others 
    =
        are constantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to<BR>that=
 
            on Door to the Dead. None of those measurements were made by =

            this<BR>team. The use of thermal in this situation is not indi=
cated 
            as well.<BR>>  <BR>> The real concern is that=
 no attempt 
            was made to help this family in<BR>a broader conte=
xt. The skeptic 
            did and said nothing skeptical as far<BR>as I =
could tell. Key 
            questions were not asked (at least on-camera)<=
BR>that would reveal 
            the psycho-dynamics of this family. We kn=
ow fairly<BR>well at this 
            time that PK phenomena is often cent=
ered on a focal<BR>person who 
            can exhibit specific characteris=
tics. That the team seems<BR>unaware 
            of this is quite disturbi=
ng to a person like myself.<BR>> 
             <BR>> A real rese=
arch opportunity was lost in this case, as 
            was an<BR>opportuni=
