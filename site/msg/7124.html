 Just wanted to stress the clarity with this. It's manually tuned with a t=
en turn potentiometer, yet the voices mentions stuff that applies to the co=
nditions at the time, such as, at first a voice says "just give me another =
board". Is that ghost box board, or perhaps discussion board? Then a woman =
talks about going downstairs, my work room is down stairs. That's how this =
works, at least some of it, sychronisitic, and meaningful coincidence.

This is a very simple system. It requires some techno knowledge to find a s=
uitable tuner from a car stereo, but that's about all. The modules I get ar=
e from older digital car tuners of the late 80s to early 90s. I usually get=
 ther radios form junk yards, but also find them in thrift store (second ha=
nd shops). The radio has to be power up, and scope, or volt used to determi=
ne the pin out of the tuner module, looking of main power, which is usually=
 8 volts, the tuning voltage, input, and audio output. As well as any other=
 voltages, such as band switching if you have an AM/FM tuner, and the anten=
na input. These AM tuners seems to work ok on a 9 volt battery, I do like t=
o use a small serius resistor of 20 to 30 ohms to drop the voltage down jus=
t to protect the tuner. On my boards I use a 78L08  regulator(from mouser.c=
om) to get the 8 volt operating voltage. Then I use LM386 amplifier chips f=
rom Radio Shack to drive the speaker. The amoplifier schematic is on the ba=
ck of the package. 
 
 The clarity of the voices in manual mode, to me, sug=
gests that the tuning rate should be much slower that I ever thought.

 would ignore the critics that would think this is only broadcast fragments=
