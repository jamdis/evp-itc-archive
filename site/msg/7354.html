Hi I am new to the group.  Now that you have your box, what type of questions have you asked?  Like, "What happens when we die? Where do we go? Is there a light? Do we meet with our loved ones, and can we see them in a physical form as we did when we were in our bodies, or do we just see light/energy and know it is them? After we see our loved ones, what happens next? Can we eat food there? Drink a nice glass of wine there? Enjoy a beer? Travel the globe and see all the tourist attractions on the planet? Can we travel and walk on the moon or other planets? Can we dive in the worlds oceans, and visit old shipwrecks? What is the purpose of our human life, and can we reincarnate again and how does that happen? I bet you are having a ball with that box. Please keep me in tuned to what you hear back.  Mike Edwards, Cary NC...
