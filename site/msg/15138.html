  I know-I am doing=
 it again, replying to my own reply LOL!!!

  I want to bring up that there=
 was one case we had WAY back that we did actually consider photographic or=
bs as evidence. The reason we were able to do this was that the client clai=
med she could see them with her eyes and then she would take a picture and =
sure enough-she would get orbs.

  These orbs looked exactly like your ever=
yday dust orb. While we were conducting the investigation, we had her tell =
us where to take a photo and we would take a picture. Sure enough WITHOUT f=
ail, we would get orbs right where she pointed them out to us. We could not=
 se them with our eyes, but she could.

  Now in our other photos -nothing.=
 We didn't get any orbs at all until she was around.

  At the time, we had=
 3 investigators using 3 different types of cameras - a film camera, a low =
end digital and a high end digital. All 3 were picking up these orbs on que=
ue.

  We had no choice but to consider these orbs as something other than =
dust.

  Still though, we could not say they were ghosts. All we could say =
is that we couldn't explain them.

  I agree that this can be the case-that alot of times people create what t=

isn't always the case.

    As far as helping stuck souls cross over using =
the box-I have yet to see any real evidence of that.

      This crap I hear about people supposedly crossi=
ng over stuck souls with a box? 

      Does not anyone get the concept tha=
t you create what you expect in the paranormal? If you think there's haunti=

uls you'll have no shortage of ghosts screaming for your superhuman help. O=
f course, you also create the illusion of being the big expert as well-whic=
h is what I think many want most.

      Just a suggestion--but grow up peo=
ple!
