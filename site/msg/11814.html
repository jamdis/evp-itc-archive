Go to DeadScience.com and write to Rob he has plans for a working speakjet =
box, he has made several of them. and has given out the plans to peaple bef=
or.

Hi, (Im new to the group)
No actual plans as yet, but have the concept in m=
ind that Im going to 
work into a device. Maybe this will help somewhat...
=
1. Speakjet chip and suitable audio amp.
2. PIC microcontroller, configured=
 to talk to Speakjet serial port at 
9600 baud, including baud sync and flo=
w control feedback from SJ.
3. An array of "speak" (ascii)commands programm=
ed into PIC to initiate 
outputting of all specific allophones, as per the =
Speakjet datasheet.
4. External sensor of some form (perhaps EMF) that is a=
ble to act as 
environmental trigger for allophone speaking.
5.PIC sub-rout=
ine to allow PIC to read and digitize the sensor analog 
output via the PIC=
's A/D input(s).
6 PIC sub-routine to link incoming sensor data to the sele=
ction of 
allophone output, depending on sensor level thresholds, etc and p=
erhaps 
a random selection process.

There is a Yahoo group dedicated to th=
e Speakjet chip, but it wont be 
of much help in this case. The core work i=
s in the PIC programming.

Think thats about it for now. Hope this helps.
