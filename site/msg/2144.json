It seems others have often gotten EVP \nwhere I didn&#39;t, at the same time and place.\n\nI got a LOT of them at the former Manteno State Mental Hospital (Illinois) \nlast year though.  I got the same ones on both a pocket DVR and a \ncamcorder. Most were Class B EVP because they were barely perceptible. \nBeing a radio amateur who has spent hundreds of hours digging weak voices \nout of the noise helps to hear them, though. I did get a few Class A&#39;s.\n\nSome of the things I heard were like these.  When I write &quot;questioner&quot; I \nmean someone in the group who asked the question.  When I write &quot;EVP&quot; I \nmean the response, which was not from anyone in the group.\n\nQuestioner: &quot;Are there other spirits here with you?&quot; / EVP: &quot;You bet&quot; \n(male voice, slightly speeded up)\n\nQuestioner: &quot;Are you happy?&quot; / EVP: &quot;Course I&#39;m haaaapeeee&quot; (long \ndrawn-out male voice, almost slowed down)\n\nQuestioner: Do you know what year it is?&quot; / EVP: &quot;1996&quot; (female voice, \nnormal speed, very dim. The year was in fact 2006).\n\nQuestioner: &quot;Do you like it here?&quot; / EVP: &quot;Leave this building!&quot; (normal \nmale voice but quite dim and almost in noise)\n\nTwo group members chatting, suddenly a very speeded up word thrown in / \nEVP: &quot;Fantastic&quot;. (I slowed it to half-speed with Audacity, then it \nsounded like a normal male voice with a slight accent - Italian?)\n\nGroup member commenting on shadow figure seen in adjacent part of building \nthrough window: &quot;... I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a person, at least living.&quot; / EVP: \n&quot;It&#39;s Harold Wing&quot;.  Group member &quot;I can still see it moving&quot; / EVP: &quot;It&#39;s \nHarold Wing&quot;.  Group member makes another comment / EVP &quot;It&#39;s Harold.&quot; \n(This was a Class A EVP, sounding like a very loud whisper or hoarse male \nvoice).\n\nThe Manteno State Mental Hospital was closed in 1985.  There&#39;s a lot of \ninfo here: http://www.mantenostatehospital.com\n\nThe building we were in was the last remaining building of the original \nhospital still standing that hasn&#39;t been renovated or destroyed - the \nMorgan Building.  A researcher found out that there was a patient there in \n1936 named Arnold Wing who died of malaria or typhoid.\n\nVerrry interesting stuff!\n\nZack\n\nOn Thu, 20 Sep 2007, psi_research wrote:\n\n&gt; One of the reasons I believe the researcher is often part of the\n&gt; process is because some investigators seem to be able to consistently\n&gt; obtain evp&#39;s while others are not, despite many attempts over years of\n&gt; investigating. Sometimes the teams in CA refer to those who often get\n&gt; decent results as &quot;evp magnets&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the individuals who can easily obtain good results (no matter\n&gt; where they are) may be able to channel their psychic abilities into PK\n&gt; energy and record the results as an evp. I&#39;m not suggesting this is\n&gt; what happens every time but it may be what&#39;s happening in some of the\n&gt; cases.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Bill\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;delchay2005&quot; &lt;azredant@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ---\n&gt;&gt; Hi Tracy,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you study human agent poltergeist cases of psychokinesis, the\n&gt;&gt; identified human agent is always in the house of structure when the\n&gt;&gt; objects move.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The famous Miami Hotel case that Dr. William Roll investigated is a\n&gt;&gt; great example. When a certain kitchen worker was present, all sorts\n&gt;&gt; of objects were thrown around the room. When he was not there,\n&gt;&gt; nothing happened. When he left the Hotel for good, no more activity\n&gt;&gt; was ever recorded.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I would like to try to rule out, or, support the theory that we are\n&gt;&gt; not, or that we might be imprinting EVP&#39;s on audio tracks or tape.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My own personal experience in EVP gathering leads me to believe that\n&gt;&gt; this is phenomena driven, not my subconscious mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But now I have to try and find out the truth for myself.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This last year we saw an incredible amount of EVP&#39;s being recorded\n&gt;&gt; during our cases we investigated.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://arizonaparanormalinvestigations.com/api_gallery/index.php?\n&gt;&gt; cat=4\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The above is our link to our new EVP gallery if you would like to\n&gt;&gt; listen to them. These were all recorded in the last year using\n&gt;&gt; multiple recorders in each location. There is a Grade A and a Grade\n&gt;&gt; B icon to seperate them.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; James\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Tracy &lt;loneshewolf999@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I am not sure this would still rule it out.  I don&#39;t think\n&gt;&gt; psychokinesis is restrained by walls, the mind isn&#39;t restrained by\n&gt;&gt; walls whether human or deceased.  I am guessing that psychokinesis\n&gt;&gt; behaves similar to telepathy....\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   I believe many evp&#39;s are deceased spirits, but the question on\n&gt;&gt; whether it could be a living person imprinting the evps was\n&gt;&gt; certainly one that made me really think !\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Frank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;               Hi James,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Back when I still investigated haunted sites, our team did this on\n&gt;&gt; various occasions within a house where we recorded several hours of\n&gt;&gt; activity over a few years (a long term investigation). We would\n&gt;&gt; leave our audio equipment recording in several &quot;hot spots&quot; all over\n&gt;&gt; the house and then leave for an hour or two. I have to say, in our\n&gt;&gt; experience we never got an EVP while we were out of the house. As a\n&gt;&gt; matter of fact we had an EVP when we reentered the house\n&gt;&gt; saying, &quot;here they come, lets go&quot;. I don&#39;t necessarily understand\n&gt;&gt; why a ghost or spirit would talk with no one present to receive the\n&gt;&gt; message unless during setup you explained what you are trying to\n&gt;&gt; accomplish and what the spirits roll is in the experiment (we never\n&gt;&gt; tried explaining). A piece of machinery (recorders) in an empty room\n&gt;&gt; does not have a consciousness or spiritual presence I would be\n&gt;&gt; interested to see if you get different results.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Frank\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   ----- Original Message ----\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: delchay2005 &lt;azredant@&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 18, 2007 6:47:24 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] EVP Experiment planned in October.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     To try and rule out that the EVP researchers are imprinting\n&gt;&gt; voices\n&gt;&gt;&gt; psychokinetically on audio players mistaken as ghosts voices, I\n&gt;&gt; will\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pre-tape an interactive evp session.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I will record a bank of thirty questions, 20 seconds of silence\n&gt;&gt;&gt; after each question, on a cassete tape and played on a cassette\n&gt;&gt;&gt; player that will be utilized in all three buildings in a known\n&gt;&gt;&gt; haunted location just outside of Phoenix, Arizona.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; There will be digital recorders, cassette recorders, omni\n&gt;&gt;&gt; directional microphones, condensor microphones, as well as an\n&gt;&gt;&gt; electrocet boom microphone present in all of the sessions. There\n&gt;&gt;&gt; will be no human agents in the buildings when these sessions take\n&gt;&gt;&gt; place.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; My hope is to:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Record an authentic EVP with no human agent in the building.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If this is phenomena driven, will the phenomena communicate by\n&gt;&gt;&gt; responding to questions from a machine rather than a human agent?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have any ideas to enhance this experiment, please feel free\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to let me know.
