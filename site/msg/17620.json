As usual, ignore all =\r\nfacts and all other methods, such as EVPmaker, which forms all the voices i=\r\nnside&nbsp;the computer. Ignore all phone EVP messages, ignore all voices h=\r\neard with no electronic aids. Ignore messages received via turned off TV an=\r\nd printers--and on and on, yet they know all about EVP..Ignore the fact tha=\r\nt probably thousands use boxes successfully.&lt;/div&gt;\n  \n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n \n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&quot;We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep EVP =\r\nand the results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of s=\r\nuch devices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how EVP =\r\nand visual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it is=\r\n difficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without soli=\r\nd research supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to recom=\r\nmend it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies conducted by=\r\n experienced researchers that shows it does produce phenomena, we would gla=\r\ndly promote it as an alternative technique.&lt;br&gt;\n &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\nWe are pretty s=\r\nure that, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the voice is formed in the =\r\nelectronics by transforming available audio-frequency noise in an active pa=\r\nrt of the electronics such as a transistor junction. We think the process i=\r\ns amplification of a weak telekinetic signal via stochastic resonance and w=\r\ne have found that the optimum audio-frequency signal for this is a chaotic =\r\none rich in voice-frequencies with many transient perturbation. That is our=\r\n working hypothesis. &quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n  \n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n \n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;I can&#39;t say =\r\nwho this is from, cuz almost certain I&#39;d get sued.
