<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I also agree, I didn&#x27;t think of that aspect, that using the box away from home also means making more friends...

&gt; I agree that the voices come to you in your home, I think we can all agree on that.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; As a ghost hunter, locations allow you access to voices that would otherwise never find you.  I am not sure why this is, but it seems that the spirits like to hang around certain areas.  I know that radius has nothing to do with it because I have been on hunts hundreds of miles from my house and I get the same voices I have at home.  I have also been on hunts far from my home where I met someone new on the other side that was there again when I turned my box on at the house!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I love the idea of doing GBC at home and I try to get in at least 2 sessions a week.  But, going to a location has its perks too.  You can find out names and historical facts that you wouldn&#x27;t know otherwise.  If you go to a place it seems like you announce yourself to a new group of people when you turn on your box, and you never know, those people might stick with you for a while.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It has always puzzled me how they recognize me when I am on no matter where I am.  One of the greatest pieces of evidence we can gather is having the same voice communicate with you in different parts of the country.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; As it has been stated before, you can use a box anywhere there is a radio station and you&#x27;ll get something.  But, the more places you travel too, the more access you have to a growing chorus of voices.

&gt;  I, as a rule, don&#x27;t go to haunted locations. For one thing, don&#x27;t like that creepy walking through spider web feeling at some of these places.  Second, spirits and entities travel, they will come to you.

&gt; For me its mainly at home, because I&#x27;m a homebody I love home... and the added bonus with that is that you get to see how amazing the ghost box is even when you&#x27;re not in &quot;haunted&quot; locations. The most calls for help I&#x27;ve ever gotten have been just sitting at home on my bed... it&#x27;s just simply amazing. My sessions are one to two times a week...
