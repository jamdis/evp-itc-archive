IMO, that is the biggest problem that serious \n&gt; &gt;  researchers of any field face-their own biases. It is good to be \n&gt; skeptical,  but you \n&gt; &gt; HAVE to keep open to any possibility, and realize that there  can be \n&gt; holes in \n&gt; &gt; even your own, well thought out theories.

I don&#39;t truly  know a whole lot about headphones, I only know \n&gt; &gt; these came highly  recommended and were moderately priced. I think I paid \n&gt; $50. \n&gt; &gt; They are  very light and comfortable for full headphones. They have \n&gt; thick, \n&gt; &gt;  padded ear cuffs and a padded headband. The others I have-the ear bud \n&gt; types,  \n&gt; &gt; make my ears hurt.

In the &quot;tomorrow let  you know&quot; EVP, \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; do hear something...&lt;WBR&gt;.just can&#39;t be  sure that it is a voice. I does \n&gt; &gt; have a cadence similar to someone  speaking, but it could just as easily \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; something present in the  environment-&lt;WBR&gt;a natural background noise. \n&gt; There is \n&gt; &gt; no  way for me to tell for certain as it is just too feint. I can&#39;t make \n&gt; &gt;  out any clear words. Sure-I could probably matrix some in, but that is \n&gt; all it  \n&gt; &gt; would be. For an EVP to be considered proof positive of spirit  \n&gt; &gt; communication by the community at large, it has to be clear enough  that \n&gt; many people \n&gt; &gt; hear the same thing, without hints or coaxing. If  you have to have high \n&gt; &gt; quality devices to make it out, it just isn&#39;t  good enough. That does not \n&gt; mean it \n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t a true EVP, just that it  isn&#39;t good enough to stand as evidence. \n&gt; As \n&gt; &gt; for the whistle, it  sounded like feedback to me as well, but I will have \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; take you word  for it that you were no where near any other electronics \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; EMF&#39;s  that could contribute to feedback. Even so, if I am trying to \n&gt; remain \n&gt; &gt;  unbiased and objective, there is no way for me to say this is a spirit,  \n&gt; &gt; without personally being with you when you caught it. The only thing  I \n&gt; can \n&gt; &gt; still say about it is could be, but for me it is non  conclusive. If \n&gt; someone \n&gt; &gt; does not hear what you are hearing, try to  remain objective and just \n&gt; &gt; understand that it isn&#39;t personal. You have  to understand that with just \n&gt; these \n&gt; &gt; recordings alone, there is no way  to scientifically prove what you have \n&gt; &gt; recorded is spirit  communication. If you could get consistent, \n&gt; intelligent \n&gt; &gt; question and  answer recordings, then you would be alot closer. Here \n&gt; again, we are \n&gt; &gt;  back to the &quot;So what?&quot; thing.

If you don&#39;t want contrary opinions on something,  then you \n&gt; should \n&gt; &gt; not give people the chance to critique.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now I could  see if someone flat out said your recordings \n&gt; were \n&gt; &gt; all trash, period.  You would have every right to be angry, but no one is \n&gt; &gt; saying that, at  least I am not saying that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just stated that I did not hear what James  heard, and \n&gt; &gt; though I wasn&#39;t going to say he doesn&#39;t have anything, I  can&#39;t say that \n&gt; he does \n&gt; &gt; either.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Frank Sumption \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; To: _EVP-ITC@yahoogroup To: \n&gt; _EVP-ITC@y_EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) )  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, May 15, 2009  11:00 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: what  you hear is what you get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, and  we&#39;ve all heard the thing about opinions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F-s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; On Fri, May 15, 2009 at 10:53 AM, April Abercrombie &lt;april@&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Noone is saying what they hear is law, just their  opinion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  From: Frank Sumption \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To:  _EVP-ITC@yahoogroup To:  _EVP-I_EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ \n&gt; (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) )  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, May 15, 2009  10:43 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: what  you hear is what you get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Soooo, everyone hears different, and personally I  find it \n&gt; &gt; offensive when someone presumes to tell everyone what another  \n&gt; researhcer&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; voices really say.

Sometimes I could sort of \n&gt; hear  \n&gt; &gt; something that sort of sounded like what you suggested, but I could  also \n&gt; &gt; hear it in other ways, or not at all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So my suggestion to you,  if you want to get less subjective \n&gt; &gt; conjuctures or simply less  affirmations of your own interpretations, is \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; post the future ones  without labels. The labels you give can influence \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; listeners: when  you have a sound that could be several things, and you \n&gt; note \n&gt; &gt; that it  sounded like &quot;keep it moving&quot;, the listener can find it nearly \n&gt; &gt;  impossible to try NOT to hear what you heard, and so not be able to give \n&gt; a  \n&gt; &gt; fresh perspecive to help your research methods. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In  _EVP-ITC@yahoogroup --- In\n&gt; &gt; (mailto:_EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) ) ,  \n&gt; &quot;James W.

I said 16 (my earlier age I was \n&gt; saying in  \n&gt; &gt; recorder) and the male evp said 13....then a female laughs.
