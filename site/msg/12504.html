<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, we&#x27;re on the same page regarding appropriation by the Catholic 
Church.  Here&#x27;s a bit regarding Satan that I recently contributed to 
a conversation on another discussion group, interesting timing  (I&#x27;d 
also be willing to discuss this stuff further offlist, I know have 
Frank doesn&#x27;t like a lot of religious discussion here):

&quot;A perfect example (which I believe I mentioned before) is Satan, 
which was a Hebrew word appropriated by the Church under the context 
of &quot;the devil&quot; himself or &quot;lucifer&quot;. In Judaism it refers to 
god&#x27;s &quot;angel&quot; that&#x27;s translated as the &quot;adversary&quot; - it stands 
for &quot;choice&quot;. A &quot;prosecutor&quot; if you will, he gives you choice - to 
which there is an outcome - i.e. a consequence. Without something to 
choose against, there&#x27;d be no &quot;free will&quot;, hence &quot;Satan&quot; or &quot;ha-
Satan&quot; was created. There&#x27;s nothing inherently negative about that, 
other than the ominous notion to choose wisely.  All 
energy, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, all comes from the same source in 
Jewish/Kabbalistic belief. &quot;Angels&quot;, &quot;demons&quot;, etc. are not
considered to have free will (that&#x27;s what we were created for), and
are seen as simply direct extensions of the same &quot;one&quot; (hence the main
angels have &quot;el&quot; - alpeh lamed - as part of their name). Its based
via the concept of a pure monotheism viewpoint. All are simply
extensions and therefore parts of the whole.&quot;

&gt; Since the early Christian church made up the idea of a &quot;devil&quot; 
from  
&gt; the Kabbalistic term &quot;Satan&quot; which is a thing not a being, I like 
the  
&gt; Jewish definition which is much more interesting, though that&#x27;s a  
&gt; pretty radical idea. The orthodoxy tend to be much more radical  
&gt; though. Even the kid in Maryland that The Exorcist story is based 
on  
&gt; wasn&#x27;t possessed, but found to have Tourette&#x27;s syndrome. I wouldn&#x27;t 
be  
&gt; surprised if all cases of people claiming possession have a simple  
&gt; scientific or medical explanation.

&gt; &gt; Well, the concept of a Dybbuk is a bit different than the popular
&gt; &gt; concept of &quot;posession&quot;. It usually involves a soul that has not
&gt; &gt; accomplished something they were supposed to and cannot advance
&gt; &gt; further, so they return and bind with the living to do it. Its
&gt; &gt; considered a rare occurance and usually only acknowledged or dealt
&gt; &gt; with by some of the orthodoxy.
