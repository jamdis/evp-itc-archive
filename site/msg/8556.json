However, I&#39;m not sure if this really\ntakes place. Some time ago I had made some experiments to find out if\nthe sound is changed for EVPs. I compared the original signal to the\nsignal which had been transferred acoustically, and except for the\nreverberations from the room etc. I could never hear any significant\ndifferences; thus a manipulation of soundwaves did not take place and\nseemed to be unnecessary for the production of EVP. This led me to the\nconclusion that &#39;they&#39; usually don&#39;t manipulate our physical\nsurrounding.\n\nStefan\n\n&gt; Hi Stefan and Steve. The closest thing I&#39;ve gotten to an answer from\n&gt; &quot;Arthur&quot; about how this is working is the words &#39;air&#39; or &#39;air-to-air.&#39;\n&gt; This makes little sense to me, unless there is some type of additional\n&gt; manipulation taking place acoustically, because I am not recording in\n&gt; a closed environment. I am playing the file from EVP Maker using an\n&gt; external speaker and recording using the built-in mic of my MAC.\n\n&gt; I have no idea, what, if any difference this might make in terms of\n&gt; opportunity for &#39;them&#39; to speak intelligent phrases. Just thought I&#39;d\n&gt; share what I&#39;m hearing. I&#39;ll keep asking, and trying to get a clearer\n&gt; explanation of the process (though I&#39;ve never had much luck with that\n&gt; in the past, in regard to getting explanations for the mechanics of\n&gt; any other technique!)\n\n&gt; Margaret"}
