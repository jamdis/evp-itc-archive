I was hoping he&#39;d pop up today and there would be a lot\n&gt; of joy. I was very excited this morning, for a few short moments,\n&gt; until I realized I&#39;d already missed Frank&#39;s return *and* his  \n&gt; departure.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if he will come back again. And I won&#39;t try to convince\n&gt; him.\n&gt;\n&gt; But if Frank does come back, I hope you all can understand that you\n&gt; are all in the same place at this time *because of Frank.*\n&gt;\n&gt; He doesn&#39;t owe anyone an explanation for why he does what he does,\n&gt; with whom, and for whom. He doesn&#39;t need to believe that anyone is\n&gt; more special than anyone or more deserving.\n&gt;\n&gt; Things *are* getting a little messianic around here, HMO. And the one\n&gt; thing I can say from watching this field for 30 years is that\n&gt; messiahs come and go and never really are. What is are the little\n&gt; glimpses of life after death, in other dimensions, and seemingly all\n&gt; around us, invisible. That is the *only* verifiable truth of this,\n&gt; HMO: *Something* is out there and it will talk to you, if you let it.\n&gt; Beyond that, we are in no way prepared to make definitive statements.\n&gt;\n&gt; No one should be asking Frank for anything at this point. He should\n&gt; be free to gift his boxes on whomever he feels is the one that should\n&gt; have it--or not at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Before anyone jumps on me, yes, I used to ask for a box from him,\n&gt; because there were no other alternatives then and because we had\n&gt; known each other on several other lists for about five years and were\n&gt; friends.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bu now there are alternatives--lots of them. Buy a minibox, like I\n&gt; did. If that $400 price tag is too heavy, go to Radio Shack and make\n&gt; a hack. The radio, rechargeable batteries, and an adaptor cost us $70.\n&gt;\n&gt; No one should be asking Frank for anything at this point. He should\n&gt; be free to gift his boxes on whomever he feels is the one that should\n&gt; have it--or on no one at all. He doesn&#39;t owe anyone anything. He\n&gt; already founded this feast.\n&gt;\n&gt; Okay, enough out of me.
