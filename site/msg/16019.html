<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve just had a thought (maybe the only one today!):  would it be possible to tell one of my guys -- Steve perhaps if he comes back around -- to go visit Frank and talk to him (telling him something besides gloom and doom)?  Has that ever happened before, where an entity is heard on two different people&#x27;s boxes, and the people operating those boxes don&#x27;t know each other?

&gt;  Assembly time is cut in half with the printed circuits boards, but it&#x27;s
&gt; still tedious. All resistors and non-electrolytic caps are surface mount.
&gt; The wood box I picked up at the thrift store this afternoon for $1--had a
&gt; feeling I should go check to see what they had. The previous TRF boards took
&gt; 36 hours, just for the board, this one took 16. Then maybe an hour all
&gt; togeter for the antenna, it has to be wound, then glued, then the turns
&gt; adjusted for full band coverage.
&gt; 
&gt;  At 10 seconds on --2 &quot;giant Earth quake&quot; and I heard that before I started
&gt; recording as I was adjusting the tuning voltage.
&gt; 
&gt;  Yeah, I know--I have all the fun---yea!
