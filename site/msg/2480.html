<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I clearly hear the voice, Frank. No chance you&#x27;re using Asian porn as  
a sound source, huh? ;)

&gt; as a bell and you&#x27;re right, that isn&#x27;t something they would play on  
&gt; the radio.  The rest of it I could hear clear too, I just had a  
&gt; hard time hearing the very first part, but that one part was so   
&gt; clear I was like wow wow!

&gt;  Same old story, get a voice that should be extra-ordinary, and not  
&gt; one friggin&#x27; comment. I was wondering over the weekend if I&#x27;ve  
&gt; spent enough time on this. The boxes produce little that anyone  
&gt; seems to hear, and if it&#x27;s too clear, I&#x27;m sure some, or maybe many  
&gt; don&#x27;t believe it. I guess it has to be that whispery s--- that you  
&gt; have to filter into oblivion to be a &quot;true&quot; EVP, and I think that&#x27;s  
&gt; what most are listening for, it has to fit the paradigm of current  
&gt; ghost hunting knowledge, or it&#x27;s rejected. I&#x27;ve reached a point  
&gt; where I&#x27;m tired of working on something that seems so pointless.  
&gt; What if what I hear think I hear is only my own mis-perceptions!?
