Hi Mike,
Ive had a listen to your file, and severely altered pit=
ch and stretch 
to see if I could hear any embedded voices segments.
Ive co=
pied a sample off which says something like...
"watch out...I dont know wha=
t you are doing"
Its saved here ..

Incidentally, what is the model number of the diodes that you are 
using in=
 your detector?
regards,
JEFF
