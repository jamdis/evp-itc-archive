I was surprised too. 
   
  I am trying to determine how they communicate to us, and how their message is attached to that radio sound we receive.
   
  Where I am going with this?
   
  If we can figure out how they attach their message, then maybe we can figure out what is the best tool to use. So lets say they tell any of us they use telepathy. Then we should see if we can find a person that has telepathic abilities to see if they can turn that radio on and send a telepathic message to see if it attaches to the sound on the radio.
   
  Now the response I got was they use their mouth, so that leads me to think that maybe they do have a voice box on their end, but then the next question is, how does their message latch onto the sound of the radio.
   
  That is why I sugested we try and get a medium to help us. The closer we get to how they get their message to us, and or what is the best equipment we already have on earth we can use to hear them, then we can start testing those devices.
   
  Does anyone know Chip Coffey well enough to ask his assistance. I hear Chip received a franks box. If Chip can set up the radio, and ask the spirits those questions using his mediumistic abilities, that would be great.
