Bruce,
   
  My only problem with this is when I did started Box research 2 1/2 - 3 Months ago.  From ghost box research (not sound soap, or EVPmaker) I saw alot of messages/files posted  that were 4-10 words long, and you and others were bragging on how long of a message y'all had, and that nobody else could get messages that long.  That is were I feel that I have been mislead.  I didn't know that those files/messages had the garbage cut out of it.  I actually thought y'all got messages that long from the radio/Franks Box.  I was trying to get communication like that,  and wondered why I couldn't.  I do know now that it is physically possible to get that type of communication after I lost my session 22, but it doesn't happen like that every time.  I mean no disrespect about this situation.  Also I don't see myself as a "Newbie" anymore.  If you want to go by ranks, I would like to be refer ed as a "amateur box researcher".  If you have anything else to say, I think it needs to be
 taken care of in private emails.  You should have my work and personal email addresses.
   
  Thanks
   
  William

          William,
 
With all do respect and I do mean that. 
 
You are a newbie and you just started box research.
You are pursuing this subject quite passionately.
 
If you feel that you have been misled in any advice or representation here.
Go back and look at the posts from when you first started asking questions.
 
you will note that I have always said that the "CRAP" was cut from my files
and even have recommended audio programs to new researchers for that specific purpouse.
 
And you seem to be under the misconception that because you take out the blips and blurbs
that the message or answer somehow changes, no it does not!
 
the message is the same only the bits of noise crap are gone.
It's like you speaking a sentence once and coughing in the middle, and then repeating the sentence without coughing.
It's the same sentence with the same meaning, minus the cough.
 
William, I like you and your dedication to learning this research, but you are still learning and should take in subjects like this and digest them
before arguing the point with much more experienced researchers.
 
Again no disrespect meant, just some advice from a friend.
 
Bruce

Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP

        My point is let everybody know that the clip is cut, because it just might mislead people (Newbies) in thinking that you get messages that long without all the bullshit.  They might wander why they can't get a messages like that.  I think I been somewhat mis lead myself on this subject when I first started box research.

  Example Question: How are you today?  
   
  1st Answer:(Cut Up) I'm good, me and my spirts friends here wants to give you a long message for the reseachers to here>  
   
  2nd Answer:(Not Cut) I'm blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah good blah blah.

  Does anybody see my point on cut up messages?

      Stefan,
 
I do remove the "garbage" from my files.
 
At this point in my research, the message is more important to me than the proof of it.
I think most of us here will agree that we are receiving some sort of paranormal communication.
but it definitely exists. now we need to concentrate on the messages they need us to hear and the answers to the questions
we ask and in turn our answers to their questions. Anyone that cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the file
that has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously garbage like the "EH O EH AH O EH UR" in between words.
 
For example "Is there anyone here that wishes to communicate_YES_AH ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE"
It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return to a file that I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold some
relivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds.
 
At this stage in real time communication the messages are the top priority.
I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained and made available to individuals that make a request 
for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may be made, and god knows there are always fanatical 
sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to attack an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that 
our research files should be made available on request by every tom dick and harry that is unknown to us and may potentially
doctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such.
 
I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the researcher that receives the request for raw research data should 
scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment before handing out any research data.
 
These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file.
 
Bruce

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP

      Hi all,

just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I would
suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, in
order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can for
instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including
the experimenter's voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, but
not cut out individual pieces (supposed "garbage") to make an EVP match
with what it "should be". At least, the unedited version should always
be provided along with the edited version.

But that's only my personal opinion which I thought I had to express, as
we should always be able to present our results to a critical public.

Stefan
