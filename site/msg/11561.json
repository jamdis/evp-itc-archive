They have an EVP lecture tomorrow and I think it would be interesting to ask a question and see what they have to say about what we&#39;re doing.\n\n-Aaron\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;threadsintyme@...&quot; &lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Is the TAPSCON being onlined streamed at all? \n&gt; Al\n&gt; \n&gt; -- &quot;kolrone&quot; &lt;a.cronk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I tried sending this yesterday (Friday), but I guess it didn&#39;t go through. &quot;I know how some people feel about the TAPS guys, but is anyone going to TAPSCON ( http://tapscon.com/ ) in Clearwater, Florida this weekend? I can&#39;t make it on Saturday, since I have to work, but I&#39;m thinking about going on Sunday. If you go to the site it has a live feed (which I plan to watch at work) and its venue, etc. There&#39;s going to be all kinds of different stuff, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth the money. I think it&#39;d be interesting to go though.&quot;\n&gt;   \n&gt; -Aaron\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; ____________________________________________________________\n&gt; Free information - Musical Education Degrees.
