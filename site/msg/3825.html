<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have to opine that we really have no idea yet whether that is all  
true or not. Only time will tell and only the if a wide variety of  
researchers use the equipment under varying circumstances.

&gt; After doing box research for a while now and having the opportunity  
&gt; to work with several different
&gt; types of boxes. I would have to agree the boxes are meant for and  
&gt; work better as a stationary communication device
&gt; sort of like a communication station that is consistently under the  
&gt; same basic conditions. I have never taken my boxes out of my home
&gt; or done a session out side of my home and I don&#x27;t believe that  
&gt; taking the box , any box not just yours to a remote allegedly  
&gt; haunted location
&gt; will not serve to enhance communication. And if anyone is really  
&gt; concerned about summoning dark entities they have a much better chance
&gt; of that communicating with a grounded and maybe disgruntled or  
&gt; confused entity at a haunted location.
&gt;
&gt; so I agree with your assessment of box use 100%

&gt;
&gt; This &#x27;negativity&#x27; is bad enough, I wouldn&#x27;t even want it on the  
&gt; group except Moon is the one that says everyone else,  me and the  
&gt; group included, gets only &#x27;false communcation&#x27; or &#x27;bad guys&#x27;, and  
&gt; that&#x27;s from his own friggin&#x27; blog, I didn&#x27;t make that up, or pull  
&gt; it out of my butt. So it effects us all, and I think is open for  
&gt; discussion/comment knowing this will get forwarded back to him. In  
&gt; fact I&#x27;ll cc Moon this posting.
&gt;
&gt;  When he says all these scan radio users, that means me to, since I  
&gt; use the things, and I prefer the linear scan mode. What I say about  
&gt; the box use is completely disregarded, and what I get through the  
&gt; box, myself, as The Box Maker, is minimalized by Moon. Moon puts my  
&gt; name out there connected with his so called &#x27;telephone to the  
&gt; dead&#x27;, and I very much disapprove of my name being applied to an  
&gt; unauthorized use of my equipment. I don&#x27;t give a crap what he gets  
&gt; through the boxes, or does with it, but don&#x27;t make it look like I  
&gt; designed it specificaly as the &#x27;telephone to the dead&#x27;, I designed  
&gt; it as a friggin&#x27; ITC device, that is capable of two way  
&gt; communication--SOMETIMES, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a guarenteed  
&gt; connection, and you can&#x27;t just dial up anyone, anytime, that&#x27;s an  
&gt; exageration! The &quot;box&quot; was intended by me to be used in a fixed  
&gt; location, just by taking it to a GHU, or an &quot;investiigation&quot; is  
&gt; using it in a way I did not intend, and I still say it&#x27;s better if  
&gt; used in one place. All guide lines I have offered for box use are  
&gt; completely ignored, not just by Moon, to be fair.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  It has been shown that many different approaches work for this  
&gt; communcation, I suggest Moon design and build his own &#x27;telephone  
&gt; the dead&#x27; and leave my name out of it.
