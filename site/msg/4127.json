The rechargeable battery lasts about 40-50\nhours on one charge... nothing to replace that way. It has both a\nspeaker output and one for a recorder so you can not only hear it as\nloud as you like, but you can directly record your session from the box.  \n\nWhen it comes to audible differences, the quality of the electronics\nused provides clearer sound. I am not straining so much to hear\nthings. It is just speculation on my part, but it seems to take less\ntime and less effort for communication from the other side to come\nthrough with the Mini. At least, in my experiences with both devices.\nThough, I have gotten snippets from the RS Hack that were impressive.\n\n~April \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi April   Can you be more specific on the &quot;marked differences&quot;   ron"}
