Any clear Quartz is good for bring energy into a room. Looks like 
the crystal enhancer they are putting into the MiniBox is an Asian 
quartz crystal wand. A wand emits both positive and negative energy. 
It strongly amplifies energy and focuses it to where it is needed. 

I use a lot of different kinds of crystal when meditating. The one I 
seem to have the strongest communication with are called Lemurian 
Quartz. When I use them they literal start vibrating in my palms. 

Apophyllite is another good crystal for spirit communication but it 
usually only comes in a cluster.

Hope this helps. If you have any other questions on crystal I am a 
huge rock hound and have been using and studying the properties of 
crystal for a long time.

&gt; Crystals are used for channeling the spirits energy. I use 
crystals 
&gt; during meditation and have had great results with spirit 
&gt; communication. I assume by adding the crystal to the Minibox it 
&gt; would increase spirit communication giving the spirit another 
&gt; channel to go though.

&gt; &gt; This is going to sound crazy, but I&#x27;ll keep my clicking. I don&#x27;t 
&gt; hear it anymore during the session. I just like an old person when 
&gt; they get use to something, they will keep it. Nothing new. But I 
&gt; am in the market for a Mini Box with the crystal enhancer. Does 
&gt; anybody know what the crystal enhance does? I know that crystal 
&gt; have energy, but what is the enhancer?
