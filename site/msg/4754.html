<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Okay, I figured out what I was doing wrong. I&#x27;m just learning how to  
use Audacity, I was using &quot;Invert&quot; instead of &quot;Reverse.&quot; My bad!

&gt; Steve, holy cow, you&#x27;re right, it says Margaret! That is interesting  
&gt; that you didn&#x27;t hear anything in my second clip. I had reversed my  
&gt; clip previously, but didn&#x27;t sounds like anything but backwards  
&gt; words. How did you do that?

&gt;&gt; I hear nothing in the 2nd file, but i raised the volume of the  
&gt;&gt; first file and it sounds like it says &quot;Weirdo&quot; and i reversed that  
&gt;&gt; file and now i believe it says &quot;Margaret&quot;.  I&#x27;ve attached the 2  
&gt;&gt; files i re-worked for you.

&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m attaching an EVP that I picked up last week. We could hear it in
&gt;&gt; person at the time, and it sounded like &quot;get out.&quot; Once I pulled it
&gt;&gt; into Audacity, it sounded completely different. Slowing it down 33%
&gt;&gt; makes it sound even more different. Any guesses? I haven&#x27;t done
&gt;&gt; anything to these files other than to slow the second version down a
&gt;&gt; bit. Deb T
