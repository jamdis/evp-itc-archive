<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I never had alot of luck with it either. I tried it before with group many times but it was so distant and never clear or just nothing at all. But every now and then when I do a manual sweep I notice while I sit on dead air that sometimes thats where the best evp would come thru so I started to make it a habit that when I start and stop my sweep sessions its off station in the dead zone. I was doing a sweep the other night and they came thru real clear there with messages for my friend so I thought hmmm lets try just DRV and no sweeping and see if they can connect or if I can hear them. I heard nothing live just buzzing noise or what sounds like air/waves/whooshing now and then. So its not like some get where they hear it loud and clear and have conversations back and forth. At least not yet.

Maybe a few adjustments could change that I dont know. I never know why some days they are clearer than others.

&gt; Misty - you have a wonderful connection with them.  I have
&gt; tried DRV with no
&gt; luck.  If you don&#x27;t mind I want to pick your brains on
&gt; how exactly you do
&gt; this?  THX!  Great files.

&gt; 
&gt; I did a DRV session last night and I just wanted to share
&gt; some of the 
&gt; results with the group. They came thru quite clearly even
&gt; tho they had 
&gt; some difficulty making the link to where I was tuned off
&gt; station in 
&gt; the &quot;dead&quot; zone. I usually start and end my sweep
&gt; sessions off station 
&gt; but they had been coming thru quite clear there so last
&gt; night I did the 
&gt; entire session that way. As always Tony was there to lend a
&gt; hand.
