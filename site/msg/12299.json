I have been\nexperimenting with different filters to listen and record radio\nsweep(RS hack 20-125).\n\nI wonder if anyone has found good filters and mods to the filters for\nusing it real time filtering. The other day I threw together some of\nthere pre-built filters and got a good session(easier to listen to).\nThe next session those filters did not seem to work as well. \n\nHere is a quote from the site below(not the software distributor).\n\n&quot;DC6 is an audio editing program just like the ones we use for EVP\n(Audacity, Audition, GoldWave), except it has a neat feature called\n&quot;Live Multi-Filter.&quot; With this feature, audio coming into the computer\ncan be filtered live and the result heard with a short delay of a\nsecond or so. A typical setup for EVP would be a microphone into the\nMicrophone In jack of the computer with DC6 Live filtering what comes\nfrom the microphone and the output playing on the headphones connected\nto the computer&#39;s Headphone Out.&quot;\n\nFor those that have not heard of it, hear is a page explaining on how\nto use this piece of software.\nhttp://www.aaevp.com/techniques/techniques_evp11.htm\n\nThanks,\nJim S."}
