The amazing things are that some of the clips say the full names of the former residents.  This is a famous story as well and once we get the ok, I will be more than happy to share with all of you.  This houses history go&#39;s back to the 1800&#39;s and has been documents up until the current owner.  \n   \n  One of the former residents divorced his wife (which is documented in court records) because of abuse from the children.  This took place in the civil war ara and in fact was able to collect his civil war pension.  It is believed that some of the beating may have taken place by the creek with a whip (which is actually mentioned in the clips).\n   \n  Juli\n\nLisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n          I know you can&#39;t disclose the location, but can you summarize the haunting and what you got from the box session?
