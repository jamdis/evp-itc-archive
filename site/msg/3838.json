The &quot;box&quot; was intended by me to be used in a fixed location, just by taking it to a GHU, or an &quot;investiigation&quot; is using it in a way I did not intend, and I still say it&#39;s better if used in one\n place. All guide lines I have offered for box use are completely ignored, not just by Moon, to be fair.  \n \n \n It has been shown that many different approaches work for this communcation, I suggest Moon design and build his own &#39;telephone the dead&#39; and leave my name out of it. \n \n  \n Frank-S\n\n\n  \n  \n---------------------------------\n  Connect and share in new ways with Windows Live.
