It has a din jack for a \nCD, and all SMT constuction, except the electrolytics. The tape deck \nis kind of a module, and the radio won&#39;t work without the deck in \nplace. Japanese car radios tend to have the pin labels, I&#39;ve found \nSonys with similar markings. \n\n I didn&#39;t occur to me to take pix until after I started disassembly. \n\n This is where it&#39;s at for me, while the voices are a joy, getting a \nusable tuner, or building something--that&#39;s like Christmas morning! \n\n\n\n Frank-S"}
