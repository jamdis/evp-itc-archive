<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I totally agree.  I&#x27;ll be honest, I did just wing it on yesterdays
session.  In the previous sessions I did remember to write down the
questions I wanted to ask ahead of time.

&gt; Jeremy,
&gt;  
&gt; Juli is right, it is very helpfull to have your questions thought
out before a session especially if the session is pertaining to a
certain topic.
&gt;  
&gt; If you wing it, like juli said you will tend to speed up and overlap
the next question with the previous answer and then you think you did 
&gt; not recieve a response so you ask the same question again. I had
this happen a few day&#x27;s ago and when I repeated the question my tech&#x27;s
&gt; mike and lisa both said &quot;AGAIN&quot; they start to lose patience
sometimes, but you have to remember to them we must be like dealing
with kindergarten children.

&gt; Jeremy:
&gt;                You may also want to try and ask the questions
quickly (I often times write them down prior to a session).  The
reason being I have noticed that many people drag the questions or ask
more than one question prior to getting a response.  Please note that
in my research I have on occasion spoken over them and get not the
immediate response because I was too busy talking.  I have even gotten
from my tec David to (&quot;I&#x27;m  Talking) which was funny cause anyone that
knows me, knows I love to gab, lol.  I have attached to clips so you
can see what I am talking about.  The first one David tells me that
basicly I needed to listen and not speak, for he was not done.  The
second, Joel is asking a questions and the question seems to go on and
on, only to have David say &quot;Joel Speak Up&quot;.
&gt;  
&gt;                   In addition, I have also gotten as many as 3
spirits responding to your question at the same time.  I believe Bruce
and Steve have experienced that on more than one occasion.  Maybe they
could post or attach one of these files for an example.  
&gt;  
&gt;                   They know whats going on, and they will comply
with you and guide you along the way.  Best of Luck and Great
Job!ecuyler &lt;ecuyler@...&gt; wrote:

&gt; Sorry Bruce. I was so excited, I got carried away. When I&#x27;m
excited,I have a totally different thought pattern. I do understand
what you are saying though about doing it one questionat a time. I&#x27;ll
be sure to do that from now on. Thanks for the help.Jeremy--- In

wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Jeremy,&gt; &gt; There are quite a few answer or messages just in
this clip.&gt; My suggestion is to go over the clip a question at a
time.&gt; &gt; Put the whole recording into your editer and go to the
beginning&gt; of a question and then save the question and the preceeding
signalup to the next question.&gt; In a file of it&#x27;s own. Go over the
recorded data following thesingle question and look for specific
answers.&gt; to that question. If there are any save that answer to a new
file inthe editer and slow it or clean it a bit so it is
compehencible.&gt; then paste it back where it belongs in the question
file. You shouldnow have the question and answer in one file.&gt; Save it
and label it with the question and answer as one file.&gt; &gt; I hope you
understand that explination, if not fire back somequestions and I&#x27;ll
try to clarify.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; Bruce Halliday &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: ecuyler@:

After listening again, I think the &quot;tells me to&quot; part is
morethanlikely just a radio station.Jeremy--- In

new file on Esnips. It&#x27;sfairly big in size so I went&gt; ahead and put it
on there to help savespace on here. This is

I did as Bruce had asked and just used the RS 20-125 with a
digital&gt;recorder and this is what I came up with. It&#x27;s a little over
30&gt;seconds long. &gt; &gt; Bruce, if you still want to hear all of
thissession, I will put it&gt; all on Esnips. Just let me know. There
isquite a bit more to it&gt; than just this one clip. It&#x27;s amazing all
thethings that came through.&gt; &gt; Here&#x27;s a little background on the
file. Iasked two questions. The&gt; first was, &quot;Is the US governemnt
using ITCresearch?&quot; The second,&gt; &quot;How is the US goverment using ITC
research?&quot;I hear these things in&gt; this order: &quot;Yeah it is, just stop
it, juststop, you need help,&quot; and&gt; something toward the end that I
can&#x27;t quitemake out. Sounds like a&gt; couple of words and then &quot;tells me
to.&quot; Letme know what you think.&gt; &gt; Jeremy&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
