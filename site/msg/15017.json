I am currently reviewing my audio from our May 30th invest=\r\nigation.\n\n          It was me and another girl teammate present in the room=\r\n. I picked up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry =\r\nwith me. We were standing right next to another digital video recorder that=\r\n I leave beside my night vision camera. That recorder did not pick up this =\r\n3rd voice. I have asked the girl that was with me to check her recording to=\r\n see if she picked it up.\n\n          I have long felt the true EVP does not=\r\n come from sound waves in the environment, or then it wouldn&#39;t be EVP, but =\r\na disembodied voice. Somehow EVP&#39;s are appearing directly on the recordings=\r\n.\n\n          This instance with the recorders may back that theory up. That=\r\n other recorder should have picked that voice up if it were sound waves in =\r\nthe environment.\n\n          I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The =\r\nfile that is named &quot;01-02-17 Clip&quot; is the full clip. You will hear my voice=\r\n as I say &quot;Yeah&quot;, and then another comes in right after that. I think I kno=\r\nw what it says.\n\n          Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still=\r\n did not hear this until playback. It isn&#39;t clear, so I am not as excited a=\r\nbout it as my one&#39;s from the last investigation.\n\n\n            ----- Origin=\r\nal Message ----- \n            From: Frank Ratka \n            To: EVP-ITC@ya=\r\nhoogroups .com \n            Sent: Monday, June 08, 2009 1:09 PM\n           =\r\n Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] New ideas\n\n\n                  I have a running theo=\r\nry that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where =\r\nthey want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix=\r\n two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequency then if you add =\r\nor subtract them together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. =\r\nFor example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electr=\r\nic fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will ha=\r\nve a intermediate difference frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing r=\r\nange (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic equipmen=\r\nt generates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on.

If you mix \n        =\r\n          two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequency then \n =\r\n                 if you add or subtract them together you get a beat freque=\r\nncy \n                  or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is s=\r\nending a \n                  signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in=\r\n a room \n                  creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then y=\r\nou will have a \n                  intermediate difference&nbsp;frequency at=\r\n 9KHz, well within \n                  human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). =\r\nThis was just an example, \n                  but all electronic equipment g=\r\nenerates ultrasonic signals just \n                  by turning them on. Fro=\r\nm this theory I always felt that EVP \n                  were generated with=\r\nin a few inches of the recorder.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n                  &lt;DIV&gt;We are able to reproduce this affect in not only rad=\r\nio \n                  with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics =\r\nand audio \n                  as in some passive sonars and a commercial pro=\r\nduce called the \n                  &quot;audio spotlight&quot; by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                  &lt;DIV&gt;Frank R.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Mon, 6/8/09, Zack Widup \n                  &lt;I&gt;&lt;w9sz.zac=\r\nk@gmail. com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE \n  =\r\n                  style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From:=\r\n Zack \n                    Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@gmail. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: R=\r\ne: [EVP-ITC] \n                    New ideas&lt;BR&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Date: Monday, \n                    June 8, 2009, 1:56 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n      =\r\n              &lt;DIV id=3Dyiv100209972&gt;\n                    &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-te=\r\nxt&gt;\n                    &lt;DIV&gt;\n                    &lt;DIV&gt;Fascinating!
