idea for the watch like radio device, then you make one, then you go to a b=

 university, with the patten your safe noone can steal it away from you=
.   
Then you do scientific testing, you might test the spirit using Letter=
 cards 
 they can see and read off for you, there are all sorts of study's =
to 
develop  this work.  You need to see a lawyer in this area of pattens f=
irst, or 
the  old fashioned way would be to put the whole idea drawings wh=
atever, and 
take it  to post office, have them date stamp the thing, addre=
ssed to 
yourself, when it  arrives you put it away without opening it, at =
least that would 
be considered in  Court as a Copyright.  Get going!

for THEIR scientific research on the study

what they called "Real-time EV=

Sadly, r=

                  <P>Frank, I think you misunders=
tood or misread something 
                  somewhere. The AAEVP/Sarah Est=
ep Research Fund is not for 
                  AAEVP to do the research, it=
's for them to fund OUTSIDE 
                  organizations for THEIR scie=
ntific research on the study of 
                  EVP. The Windbridge Inst=
itute received some of this sponsor 
                  money for what they =
called "Real-time EVP Conversations: A 
                  Pilot Study." The=
 method for this communication was *not* 
                  based on radio =
sweep, nor traditional methods, so it's not 
                  based on wha=
t I assume many people here are doing. And in 
                  fact, it *=
was* based on the creations of someone outside of 
                  the US=
A, so I'm a little confused as to why all the hostility 
                  =
toward AAEVP for putting up the money.<BR><BR>Sadly, radio 
               =
   sweep methods don't, and may not for a long time, get the 
             =
     respect of the scientific community that it deserves (then 
          =
        again, seems no form of EVP does), but at least this current 
     =
             research is a step in the right direction. I hope, when 
     =
             Windbridge concludes their study, that it will support the 
  =
                notion that there is apparent communication formed in ways =

                  that cannot be explained by currently known and understo=
od 
                  laws of nature. THAT alone, in my opinion, would be a=
 big plus 
                  for all ITC communities, regardless of the met=
hod from which 
                  that communication was received. What's t=
he old saying? "It 
                  takes but one white crow to prove all=
 crows are not black." 
                  Any proof, derived from any EVP m=
