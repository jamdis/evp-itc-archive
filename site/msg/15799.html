    I think it varies depending on who=
 you ask as well as what they have personally experienced. As an example, s=
ome people believe in angels and demons others do not. Therefor some may ge=
t messages that correspond to their own beliefs as well as the beliefs of t=
hose who are speaking.

  Almost every person who does this eventually deve=
lops a theory that may change over time based on what they experience and w=
hat their beliefs are. Then there are those who remain undecided or have do=
ubts.

  As for me I look at it as purely educational, a learning experienc=
e. Ive met many people I never knew existed. Ive researched topics I'd neve=
r even considered. Ive gotten messages and images that are awe inspiring an=
d many interesting concepts to ponder and explore.

  There are many glimps=
es of truth, as well as momentary proof along the way that lead me to devel=
op my own theory and eventually you will develop your own too. This researc=
h is fascinating and can be quite mind blowing.

  I dont worry what anyone=
 else thinks. I have no need to prove anything to anyone else. They can do =
that for themselves. I always say honesty is the best policy and if you are=
 honest with yourself and others the only ones who object are those who's l=
ies arent tolerated. So just look for the truth yourself and dont let me or=
 anyone else tell you what that is. 

  It's a great journey and your path =
is your own!
