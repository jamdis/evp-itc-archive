Hi All,

These are from my first session with my n=
ew P SB-7.

I  conducted this experiment with my 6 year old daughter. Unfor=
tunatley you 
will  hear her say what she thinks she hears in the files. Pl=
ease try not 
to be  influenced by her. I will admit though that she seems =
to hear these 
things  much better then I can.

Though I am still not convi=
nced, some of these  are uncanny, and I was 
surprised. I will be conductin=
g ongoing, regular  experiments with this.

Opinions are  welcome.

Thanks!=

April
