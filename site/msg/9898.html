Got the same words Bruce except SOUND PEOPLE was a stretch for me.  The other file was exactly as you heard.   
   
  Do you think if this had been recorded into a trained Voice to Print software program that we could get a printout?  A leading question, admittedly.  Other question--how much editing was needed on these last two evpmaker files?  Mucho or poco?  If Steve reads this I am wondering the same about his last two files from EVPmaker.   Great stuff.
