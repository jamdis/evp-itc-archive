<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>So that is properly The Gramdma Smackdown, eh?

Most people who report calls from the dead where the recipient is  
there to take the call say that a short and usually very normal  
conversation takes place. Afterward, the person who got the call  
realized the caller was a dead person and is shocked, but during the  
call, they report barely even registering that something odd is  
happening.

&gt; Hi Ann,
&gt;
&gt; Yes very close, I have spoken to her via several boxes.
&gt; but have not been doing as many sessions lately due to the backlog  
&gt; of recordings and the time spent with
&gt; everyday buisness.
&gt;
&gt; I guess she felt that she needed to give me a reminder. I was  
&gt; actually out of the house when the call was
&gt; recorded. Or it is possible that they can place the message  
&gt; directly onto the message recorder without actuall placing the  
&gt; simulated call.
&gt;
&gt; My thought is, I wonder how it would have went, had I picked up the  
&gt; phone? I sure hope I get another chance.
