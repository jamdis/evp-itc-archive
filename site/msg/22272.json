In her book she mentions the creator of the ghost box and the name in print is Frank Sumption, not Urkel /ultay or anyone else.\n\nThis should please Frank but instead he will probably be mad and bitter about something. He does not seem to look at the good in this group or the good in life. In some areas I think this group has gotten way off course as to the original reason for starting the group.\n\nAlso, as far as I can see Urkel/hultay uses this group to promote whatever boxes he has for sale, eBay or otherwise. Then we have the others who heve a signature trailer of  paragrapgh length on anything and everything they offer (for a fee of course).....private frank box sessions? That almost sounds like another chris moon, spirit medium? What does that have to do with this group that was created becuz of ghost box research?\n\nThis group seems to have fallen apart and the expletive words in every 3-4 message doesnt help. I really have had enuf at this point.\n\nGood luck, Misty, hang on as long as u can :) life is too short to try and keep a bunch of &quot;I am better than anyone else&quot; happy and in line, meaning doing ghost box research.....\nCB\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Country&quot; &lt;countrybumpkin1956@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Obviously I am way behind in my message reading on this group, I also rarely post for fear of being attacked by someone as well. Anyone who has been involved with EVP - whether radio sweep, digital recorder, Digital  Dowsing gadgets, etc etc etc - knows that Frank Sumption was the leader in radio sweep. Why do you have to be so angry and continually use the F word. Every ghost or paranormal book I have read ( and I have well over 100 on my bookshelf) gives credit to you, Frank, and every paranormal or ghost magazine has given credit to you when there are articles about using radios for paranormal investigation. As i said earlier, most educated people in radio evp know who created the wheel in this area. So why do you let a tiny little yahoo group and a few uneducated posters bother you, which in turn upsets the rest of us.\n&gt; \n&gt; CB"}
