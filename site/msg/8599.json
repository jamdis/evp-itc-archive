That is awful.  I think it is strange how grief \ncan whip back on us, sometimes seemingly out of the blue, as if no time has passed.  Once in \na while, for no apparent reason, I will have one of those days where it just brings me to my \nknees, even after years.  Four months is not a long time at all and it is perfectly \nunderstandable how your grief could be so raw in this moment.\n\nSending big &#39;feel better&#39; hugs your way!!!\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristin&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As many of you know I lost both my niece and my nephew about 4 months\n&gt; ago. I was doing fine but this morning was rough.  I spent time\n&gt; talking to their mom and I sorta lost it after.  I did a session and\n&gt; the clips are from that.  Look for them in a a few..\n&gt; \n&gt; k\n&gt;"}
