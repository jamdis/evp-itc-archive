 Do not anyone to have you loose faith, they are very real, and very much a=
live!? In the Bible, it says, to "test the spirits, to see if they be of Go=
d"? so right there Scripture talks about spirits,? I could go into it with =
hundreds of references, you can see for yourself we are all here because of=
 "the prime mover" God, who is spirit..? Test them if you have doubt, I kno=
w they are who they say they are, I would bet my life on it too.sf

I don't know for sure it was my dad's friend.  But I=
 find it hard to believe that entities on the other side who are not dead p=
eople would go to so much trouble to impersonate my dead friends and relati=
ves -- why bother?  If they truly seek attention, why not come up with some=
thing more attention-getting than my dad's friend?  Why not impersonate my =
brother, who is really the one I'm trying to reach?  And anyways, there are=
 hundreds and hundreds of stories of people believing they have seen or hea=
rd or spoken to the ghost of their dead family members (my mother being one=
 of them).  They can't all be wishful thinking.

  

  I find it much easie=
r to believe that I'm somehow unconsciously making this happen (via the pro=
cess Phenom Investigator describes) using the box.  But since it's equally =
possible for me or a discarnate dead person to influence the box (via me an=
d PK) (because, after all, we are no different from the dead people except =
we still have our bodies), I will probably never know if it's me or them ma=
king it happen.  

  

  I do know that I hear things on the tape that are =
repeated over and over and over again, in some cases twelve times in a row,=
 which tends to rule out pareidolia.  I also have very clear sentences whic=
h anyone -- ANYONE -- without prompting could understand and hear (I've tes=
ted this with friends and family, letting them listen and asking what they =
hear).  And, like I've said, the names I've gotten have mostly been of obsc=
ure dead friends and relatives, not the ones I'm trying so desperately to c=
ontact.

  

  So I'm leaning toward the dead people theory for now.

;     Well, I would disagree with the idea I'm hearing what I want to hear.=
 The first time I got my dad's friend Gordy, I didn't even hear his name; I=
 thought he was saying "Forty, forty, forty." It was only in a later sessio=
n that he identified himself again using his full proper name. Then I reali=
zed that he is now dead (last I saw him he was very much alive), and that h=
e'd been saying Gordy all along (confirmed by playing back the old tape). I=
 certainly didn't expect to hear him come through, and yet he did, so I can=
't see how I could've expected to hear his name.
