You can&#39;t deny \nthat there is some sort of communication going on, even the hardest \nskeptics as yourself have to admit the validity of those files.  I \nbelieve in a random chance of a stray radio signal coinsiding with \nthe question asked at that time, but after 2 years and 4000 files \nlater i have to believe that this communication is real.  I also use \nother methods that do not involve a radio at all, what could make \nthat happen?  These are all good questions to make someone re-think \ntheir stance on RTSC and other ITC devices.  How can a scrambled up \nfile on a computer program called evpmaker say full sentences up to \n25 words in length?  Did i mention that the original file that was \nused had no words in it at all, only bits and pieces of audio \nsegments.  Something to think about anyway.  I used to stand on your \nside of the fence, but after a while it can no longer be ignored that \nwhat we are hearing is really happening.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I didn&#39;t hear anything intelligible.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I try to work out the sounds as phonemes, it sounds like:\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah He La Naw Tay\n&gt; \n&gt; Try reading that: Ah He La Naw Tay\n&gt; \n&gt; Then listen to the sound again.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sun, 1/25/09, Roxy young &lt;horsewhisper4u@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Roxy young &lt;horsewhisper4u@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, January 25, 2009, 6:49 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;             what I heard. was. &quot; she&#39;s not dead&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sun, 1/25/09, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com &lt;EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups .com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, January 25, 2009, 7:39 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt; File : /Steve Hultay Files/MiniBox Plus/steve_hultay. mp3 \n&gt; Uploaded by : urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@aol. com&gt; \n&gt; Description : &quot;Steve Hultay&quot;----For them to say my full name it \nquite impressive. \n&gt; \n&gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/EVP- ITC/files/ Steve%20Hultay% \n20Files/MiniBox% 20Plus/steve_ hultay.mp3 \n&gt; \n&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; http://help. yahoo.com/ l/us/yahoo/ groups/original/\n&gt;  members/web/ index.htmlfiles\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@aol. com&gt;\n&gt;"}
