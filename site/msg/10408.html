I&#x27;m sorry but I actually laughed (call me sick/twisted) and agreed 
with some of the crap he said. The parts I didnt agree on, some of it 
I notice he is one of those who has been fed some of those 
misconceptions floating around out there about Frank and his work.

That is one of many reasons why I think its important Frank stay 
active and speak for HIMSELF =)

I hope he does continue experimenting on a regular basis. We all know 
it takes effort. He says he believes theres something paranormal just 
doesnt believe in everything thats being fed to the public. I cant 
say that is a bad thing. I have watched quite a few skeptical minds 
walk into this thinking man this is a load of crap, that all seems to 
change when they hear thier full name and direct comments aimed at 
them specifically with details that usually make them think twice. 

If anything I would wish him good luck and I hope they do choose to 
speak with him directly =)

&gt; &gt;   Yes, I also heard &quot;Steve&quot; in it, too. The guy gets his name 
&gt; dropped 
&gt; &gt; more than anyone I know, doesn&#x27;t he? He must have a good agent on 
&gt; &gt; the other side! :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This guy sent me a message saying that all the boxes are fake. He 
&gt; &gt; seems like a sane fellow. Probably on the board here somewhere. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here is his video about Frank&#x27;s Box:

&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought I would reply here. I got a chance to watch that. 
&gt; Sounded 
&gt; &gt; &gt; pretty clear here. I dont know about anyone else but I hear 
Steve 
&gt; &gt; &gt; being mentioned in there more than once LOL

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LC,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I already knew your files sounded good, but the box looks 
good 
&gt; as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well. Look forward to more stuff from you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Great Job,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I decided to video record what I have been doing...just a 
&gt; &gt; simple 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explanation for anybody looking for ideas. The box in all 
&gt; four 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; videos 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is FM scan - custom built.
