As much as I can&#39;t say \n                          for=\r\n sure that it isn&#39;t pareidolia, I can&#39;t say it is \n                        =\r\n  either. Otherwise, you&#39;re right...I wouldn&#39;t even be \n                   =\r\n       bothering to look into it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As it so happens, I \n             =\r\n             just received my own spirit box today, and will start \n       =\r\n                   conducting my own sessions regularly. I do in my heart \n=\r\n                          feel that ITC is possible. Now I just want to pro=\r\nve it \n                          to myself. \n                          &lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;So why spend time ghost huntig if \n                          =\r\nyou think there&#39;s nothign to \n                          it?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;E=\r\nxactly. I don&#39;t think at all that \n                          there is nothi=\r\nng to it, or I wouldn&#39;t bother. But I \n                          want that =\r\nirrefutable proof, though it may never \n                          happen. \n=\r\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;And- I think expectations can \n=\r\n                          create/allow the conditions you want to experienc=\r\ne or \n                          investigate. You want to get EVP, but you w=\r\nant to be \n                          able to explain it away.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;Believe me...I \n                          soo want NOT to be able to expla=\r\nin it away. But to do \n                          this, I have to try and ex=\r\nplain it away. If I can come \n                          up with a viable ex=\r\nplanation, then it isn&#39;t 100% proof \n                          positive. Bu=\r\nt if I can&#39;t..then I have something. I \n                          have in m=\r\ny collection EVP&#39;s that I KNOW are EVP&#39;s, but \n                          ar=\r\ne not good enough to put up as proof because they \n                        =\r\n  could be explained away. Such is the nature of the \n                     =\r\n     business. I still keep those EVP&#39;s for me \n                          t=\r\nhough.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You&#39;ve seen me poll this group on my \n                       =\r\n   EVP&#39;s before. If I can&#39;t get a vast majority agreeing \n                 =\r\n         on an EVP, then I can&#39;t call it proof because it could \n          =\r\n                be pareidolia. Doesn&#39;t mean I think it is just \n           =\r\n               pareidolia for sure, but that is the way the cookie \n       =\r\n                   crumbles. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;\n       =\r\n                   &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n=\r\n                          &lt;DIV class=3Dgmail_quote&gt;\n                       =\r\n   &lt;DIV&gt;On Wed, May 26, 2010 at 2:28 PM, Frank Sumption \n                  =\r\n        &lt;SPAN dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;&lt;A                             title=3Dhttp://m=\r\nc/compose?to=3Dpurplealiengirl@...                             href=\r\n=3D&quot;mip://0441e268/mc/compose?to=3Dpurplealiengirl@...&quot;              =\r\n               rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank                             y=\r\nmailto=3D&quot;mailto:purplealiengirl@...&quot;&gt;purplealiengirl@ \n             =\r\n             gmail.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                    =\r\n      &lt;BLOCKQUOTE                             style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(204=\r\n,204,204) 1px solid&quot;                             class=3Dgmail_quote&gt;\n     =\r\n                       &lt;DIV                               style=3D&quot;BACKGROU=\r\nND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n\n                         =\r\n   &lt;DIV&gt;\n                            &lt;DIV&gt;\n                            &lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;\n                            &lt;DIV&gt;\n                            &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n   =\r\n                         &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;This is no problem wiht that, as long a=\r\ns \n                            you&#39;re not saying the only possible explanat=\r\nion is \n                            imagination (pareidolia) .
