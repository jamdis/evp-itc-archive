            This=

              Actually that I would buy into  But the qu=

         2 different things happening-that' s why. When you get EVP that ev=
eryone understands,  it is outward, in the environment. Not a communication=
 through subconscious means.



                EVP that people swear they =
hear, but noone else can make sense, may be a message to them via subconsci=
ous means. That isn't to say that ALL EVP's like this are true messages, I =
am sure alot are just matrixing.



                But then that is how th=
e art of scrying starts-matrixing. Like the Rorschach tests. The images you=
 matrix with those gives the psychologist an insight into your mind.



   =
             By gazing into a dark, reflective surface, you start to see cl=
oudy images. At first, you will just be matrixing faces in the clouds and n=
ot getting much substance. Try it, you will see what I am saying. With prac=
tice, you start to see clear, concise images.



                I think th=

                We already know=
 for a fact pareidolia can occur in audio as well as visual stimulus.

 I have 
              when you say "tape" are you talking old analog tape =
or digi 
              recording.  Here is the reason I believe it can=
 be do 
              "real-time".  As you all know we use electromagn=
etic Field 
              detectors in field investigations.  If a spi=
rit can 
              manipulate that with to show that they are there by =
giving off a 
              EM field whose to say they can't manipulate a m=
agnetic strip of a 
              tape or even the electronics in a Digi re=
corder to speak in
