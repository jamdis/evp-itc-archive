if frank will end that project here, then you (or we all) have the
possibility to open another yahoo group and we can continue 
to discussing. in a group all members must have the opportunity to write his
ideas and, if someone like RJ (or some others,
maybe like me) tend to other types of ideas and try to point to other
prespectives, what is here wrong?
 
we must be prepared to all evidences, also evidences that are not convenient
to our personal ideas but
maybe we can learn something more and we can change our point of view. think
about that.
 
i try to reach the goal of the "voices" with a sceptict mind, but i am
experimenting with many differente methods to hopefully 
reach maybe one day something more convincing.

I am  worried that he is going to push Frank to far and Frank will not be
here anymore
THAT IS WHAT I AM AFRAID OF... And he is the most important person here.
It's his group....and if he gets mad enough he will end it, and then what ?

i hope that RJ stay for a long time here because i like its methods and his
ideas.
if you dont like read his mails, then lets swing the delete key on your

leave him write his ideas, because others (like me) want to continue to
read.

RJ, it is very obvious that you are not here for the same reasons we are. We
are trying to prove something we know, and
you are trying to disprove it .
Why don't we all just ignore him from now on and not reply to anything he
says and maybe he will go away.....
Bye RJ. You are just not in the group that you need to be in....

I realize you have plenty of subjective anecdotal evidence.I don't consider
that 'hard evidence' however.  I am looking for something a little more
objective and less subject to influence and interpretations.

And stop putting words in my mouth. A person can misinterpret something,
mistake something, or confuse something, without lying about something.  And
before you jump down my throat claiming I am saying all results are
mistakes, I am not.  I am performing experiments, keeping an open mind, and
considering all evidence I find. 

The way you have been attacking me by calling me names at every turn, just
because I try new things and don't always agree with your world view, is
eerily reminiscent of the way the church of old tried to suppress new
thought and discoveries, except you're just substituting the word 'heretic'
with 'science'. and 'blasphemy' with anything that disagrees with you.

There's an old saying:  "We become that which we hate".  So far, all you've
done is denounce people's efforts to try new methods and see what works.
You accept nothing anyone else proposes if it does not agree with you.  That
is the realm of the extreme skeptic: the same skeptic you ridicule.
 
You certainly don't have to agree with my comments.  And I don't have to
agree with yours.  But no one needs all the name calling Frank.   It really
adds nothing to support your theories.

 Yeah I know, science no accept anecdotes. There is plenty of hard evidence,
trouble, science don't accept that either cuz they are taught, no spirits,
so there are no sprit voices, fact is fact is facts. Well that's about all
there is in this field. Perhaps you should take bird watching or something
concrete. To not accept what others say is the same as calling us all liars,
and I find very insulting. 
 
 How irrational is it to ignore all evidence and continuously try to fit the
phenomon into a diffintion where it will not fit and does not belong, and
then claim you're looking for a more rational explantation, it just does not
make sense. I say forget the BS "science" whatever that is, puts out and try
thinking on your own.  Mr Spock was a fictional charactor!

 If you completely ignore what everyone else in the whole wide freaking
world gets via EVP, various photography and ITC methods, and just chance
encounters, then yeah, you probably don't have any data, and won't have any
data no matter what.

I don't think I have enough data yet to make any conclusions, so I plan more
experiments.  Since there are different distinct claims about what the box
or the recorders can do, I try to make different distinct experiments for
each.

Some people claim they can get the box to tell them things that the operator
couldn't know, so my "whats the object" experiment is one way to examine
that.  Some people claim the boxes can make predictions, so cataloging
predictions and examining the results can help examine that.  If there are
other claims, I will try to figure experiments based on those.

 I get our last dogs from time to time, and used to get them via white noise
when I first started this. Last summer some kids came down into the basement
wiht the younger grandson, and the little yorkie barked, but "get outta
here" came out, some how. 
 
 Yeah, I think I was too hard on RJ. I don't know why, but testing doens't
seem to work, but we get enough to prove this to ourselves. It's probably a
faith thing, although I'm not religious, even anti-religion.

Here is a short file, where someone says, "Scamp, Scamp," then Scamp barks.
"yap."  This little dog belonged to my grandma, when I was about 9 or 10
years old, he was a Manchester Terrier, and lived with us for many years,
and this is his bark for sure.  I'd know that bark anywhere.  Sorry, that I
can't make it any clearer, I need to get one of those better ghost boxes I
guess.  RJ, spirits are just like us, they are not omnipresent like God,
probably why David doesn't want to play the guessing game, he has better
things to do over there, and has said, they have thousands of people
standing in this long line waiting to get into the Heavens, and He can't
just drop His job and go to your house to see what you have over there, He
did tell me that first time what it was, and i sent it to you, but it was
too late.  It's hard for me to understand them sometimes, He was also right
about that little boy, Syler being killed, and where his body would be
found, I don't know what they did about it though. sf
