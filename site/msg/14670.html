I would not be able to make one myself, I would be glad to pay for one  to 
be made for me, with several waves or channels, or whatever those scans are, 
 it probably needs a long and short wave. as long as it is able to be  
plugged in to electricity is fine, as i would not going away from home, there  
are enough ghosts around here to talk to.sf

Why I've had enough of these insane idiots in the so  called paranormal. 
God forbid anyone should question their  little pearls of wisdom flowing from 
their sacred  keyboards.
 
 I''ve said it before, and I'll say it again, I do  this work for my own 
curiosity, I don't seek fame and fortune  like these others do, and I have no 
ego to puff up to the world.  I do not care if anyone uses my boxes, I don't 
even sell the  crap. It ain't gonna matter---the comet is on it's way! 
Y'all  have three years, I'd use the time wisely.
 
 I left the name off this, but anyone can probably  figure out who sent it, 
the same person that attacks many  researchers in this field. 
 
"Frank,

You have a big mouth on that piece of  shit group evp-itc come over to 
the---- group where I can  respond to your fuckin retarded rants. You call me a 
crack head,  you senile old idiot, don't hate people for being your superior 
 in the field just because your boxes are crap now and nobody  uses them 
for anything other than dust collecters. If I were you  I would go back into 
the bathroom sit on the bowl and think  about what an obscure hasbeen asshole 
you have become.  

Come to my group and open your mouth and I'll take  the wind right out of 
your fuckin sails.

All is  possible, nothing is  probable"
