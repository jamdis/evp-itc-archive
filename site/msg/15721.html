Twisting a prediction after the fact to fit circumstances is one of the big=
gest mistakes (or biggest cop-outs, or biggest lies) a would-be future-tell=
er makes.=A0 The predictions you were touting were for August 15, and inclu=
ded end-of-the-world warning..=A0 Trying to say these were correct, but not=
 REALLY for August 15, and not REALLY end-of-the-world stuff, seems like a =
way to save face, or keep hoping the messages are real, when in fact, this =
is another example that they are not.

So from now on, you will no longer h=
ear clear dates and predictions.=A0 You may hear vague dates and vague pred=
ictions if you like, but you will not hear anything that can be confirmed.=
=A0 Doing so would put you in a position of having to question the verity o=
f the EVP data you collect.=A0 And that might lead to abandoning this while=
 area of study.=A0 And we know you cannot do that.
