<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Diane,

Sorry it took a day to get back to you.  Yes, it is funny the things we sometimes think we hear (or they say? lol).  I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure it was &quot;foot in mouth&quot; - maybe &quot;food/put/ (something???) in mouth&quot;.  That&#x27;s all.  It&#x27;s tough to call something like that but there was clearly (to me) something being said that sounded that way between &quot;UFO&quot; and the laugh. Do you hear that?  I mean, do you hear anything in between?  It was in the same voice as I heard it....  hmm....  Maybe they&#x27;re messing with me :).

Adrienne

&gt; Hi Diane,  
&gt; Dear Diane,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Very clear!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the middle of the UFO recording I think I&#x27;m hearing &quot;Foot In Mouth&quot;  and 
&gt; then the same voice laughing.  What could that mean?  Is there  any context 
&gt; involving or surrounding this recording that would account for  that?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I may be wrong.  It&#x27;s your recording and it seems like we sometimes  hear 
&gt; different things for whatever reason...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Adrienne
