The files he posted are his own. As for my files I am \nstill \n&gt; working on them and after I send them to Mike and he is ok with me \n&gt; sharing them I have no problem posting them or sending them to you. \nI \n&gt; would be very interested in your opinion. On the other hand I have \nmany \n&gt; files you may find interesting I am currently working on putting \nthem \n&gt; up on esnips http://www.esnips.com/web/nightparanormalresearchsStuff\n&gt; thats the link to a couple and theres more to come in the future. \nenjoy\n&gt; back to my original question how long have you been involved with \nI.T.C \n&gt; and what is your favorite method of capturing I.T.C.\n&gt; \n&gt;                       Thanx Mike W.\n&gt;"}
