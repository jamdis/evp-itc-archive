<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, I&#x27;ve gone ahead and done it...

I purchased one of Ron&#x27;s MiniBox&#x27;s!!

No snowball will be safe in hell now!

Tell you what, instead of asking Chris about life and death or heaven 
and hell, I plan to:

1)Take a training class provided freely by ASUP.
2)Engage in a little direct inquiry and testing of spirits.
3)Strongly encourage fearless people to find their own answers, by 
doing something likewise. 

Thanks,
Lance

&gt; Lance, 
&gt; I think you make my point very well. You say you don&#x27;t know Chris
&gt; personally but that it seems I am the one wearing rose colored
&gt; glasses. I do know Chris. Even when Frank is upset he says &quot;Chris 
is a
&gt; nice guy&quot;. Chris&#x27; statements and beliefs have never changed while
&gt; others can be wishy washy depending on the day. The view that Chris
&gt; does not want any one to research the box besides him is BS. The 
fact
&gt; is that prior to Franks original yahoo group disappearing, Chris
&gt; provided a link directly to the schematics. In his presentations he
&gt; would tell people that the schematics were available online. Yet,
&gt; because he is against mass production, it MUST be because he wants 
the
&gt; research all to himself. Rose colored glasses or a case of only 
seeing
&gt; what is wanted? This is a fact compared to perceptions and 
opinions. 
&gt; 
&gt; Fact: Almost each and every user of a box or it&#x27;s facsimile have
&gt; stated that lower energy/evil/dark... entities have spoken via the
&gt; device. 
&gt; 
&gt; Fact: Rick Moran states that the groups for testing will include
&gt; believers, skeptics, senior citizens, (now here&#x27;s where it gets 
scary)
&gt; CHILDREN and HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS!
&gt; 
&gt; - Couple the last two facts together and do the math. One mentally
&gt; unstable child or youth hears the box tell him it is right to kill 
or
&gt; rape or .....
&gt; 
&gt; Fact: Rick Moran in his article about Tools being only as good as 
the
&gt; users states, &quot;...know how they work before you go into the field.&quot; 
&gt; So, in one place we are still testing, in another we are sending 
them
&gt; out in the field to be tested by groups that include children and 
high
&gt; school students. The good thing is that a nice little online 
tutorial
&gt; is available with some warnings. Phew! As long as this can&#x27;t come 
back
&gt; on anyone I guess all the bases are covered (tongue in cheek). 
&gt; 
&gt; Fact: Chris has been the primary tester of the device in the field.
&gt; That fact deserves consideration, at the very least. 
&gt; 
&gt; Fact: Last night, a radio personality on Spooky South Coast claimed
&gt; that after he engaged the dark voices coming through the box, he was
&gt; physically attacked.
&gt; 
&gt; Fact: Frank has stated that in the beginning Chris was the only one
&gt; who understood how the box should be used.
&gt; 
&gt; Fact: Some people who have received boxes from Frank discovered they
&gt; were not able to use them although they worked fine for Frank. These
&gt; same people would not return the boxes to be looked at.
&gt; 
&gt; Fact: After death communications have been received via both 
computers
&gt; and phones. If it were simply the devices and not the users would we
&gt; not have millions of these communications?
&gt; 
&gt; Fact: Mark Macy states that in an after death communication
&gt; communication with Konstanin Raudive in which Mark asks &quot; Can you 
tell
&gt; me about the equipment you use to produce a perfect, almost perfect
&gt; voice on earth?&quot; Konstanin replies &quot;Well it depends on your 
reception-
&gt; or mainly your psychic reception.&quot; This fact backs up the theory 
that
&gt; effective users are limited.
&gt; 
&gt; Fact: In another after death communication Konstanin addresses 
contact
&gt; fields saying &quot;...but if there is dissonance in the form of fears,
&gt; doubts, and animosities the contact field becomes cloudy...that&#x27;s 
when
&gt; negative spirit groups close to earth in vibration can break into
&gt; existing bridges with troubling results.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And so yes, maybe I wear rose colored glasses. However, I am 
inclined
&gt; to believe that I have done my research and have availed myself of
&gt; quite a bit of information regarding this topic. 
&gt; 
&gt; With that said, I am holding an online event where people can ask
&gt; Chris the questions they want as long as they are formed in an
&gt; intelligent manner. If you are interested in attending the event you
&gt; can find the information on the front page of my site at
&gt; www.thepsinetwork.com I felt it unnecessary to attempt to &quot;bridge 
the
&gt; gap&quot; as well between speculation, insinuation and fact. 
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; Babs

&gt; &gt; Hey Bab,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Even though I&#x27;ve newly begun to chime in here, it seems to me 
that 
&gt; &gt; some people are guilty of wearing rose colored glasses, as far as 
&gt; &gt; Chris is concerned. LOL! I don&#x27;t know him personally, so I really 
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t know what really motivates him. Right or wrong, by 
conducting 
&gt; &gt; himself in the manner he has, it&#x27;s understandable why his 
approach 
&gt; &gt; has drawn the scrutiny from his peers. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Frankly, this entire effort is a great learning experience and 
&gt; &gt; potential healing for mankind! I encourage all of us researcher 
types 
&gt; &gt; to simply sit back, and take a deep breath or three. Consider 
&gt; &gt; together why we&#x27;re doing this. Let&#x27;s work on making this world a 
&gt; &gt; better place while we have breath...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Success!
&gt; &gt; Lance

&gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce- Wow! That is a very bold statement, minus the name of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; person you are accusing (although it&#x27;s clear who you are 
referring 
&gt; &gt; to). 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I did read your apology for the negativity you&#x27;ve helped spread 
&gt; &gt; about
&gt; &gt; &gt; Christopher Moon. I acknowledge that your apology took a great 
deal 
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; humility. However, knee jerk reactions are exactly what I&#x27;ve 
been
&gt; &gt; &gt; talking about. People doing or saying without thought and 
&gt; &gt; consideration.
