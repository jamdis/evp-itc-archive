I&#39;d \nknow i&#39;d watch, maybe they can get russell crowe to play you in it.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I get grumpy, and pissed. I try to share to  information about the \nbox, and it&#39;s the same friggin&#39; arguement everytime. I&#39;m just now \nanswering e-mails generated from the mistake of leaving a comment on \na site about how I think most of what passes for paranormal \nknowledge is Hollywood. I can&#39;t get past that shit, nor can I get \npast the egos, so I give up, they can&#39;t hear me. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I think the problem is intellect, it takes a certain level to be \nable to comprehend, and use the boxes, to everyone else its&#39; going \nto look fake, and sound like gibberish. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: lisby@...: Thu, 8 Nov 2007 20:29:08 -0500Subject: \nRe: [EVP-ITC] You tube?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You don&#39;t scare me.

It&#39;s my first attempt, so I&#39;m not sure if it worked, and it&#39;s \nblocked here at work.  BTW, I&#39;m not sure if the Purple Princess \nstuff puts people off, that&#39;s who my guys say I am, and I accept \nthat as an axiom. As if it matters, but that&#39;s an &quot;other level&quot; \nidentity, and has little to do with physical conditions. Purple is a \ntreacher, that&#39;s all, I just happen to be a very poor teacher.  Frank\n&gt; \n&gt; Climb to the top of the charts!
