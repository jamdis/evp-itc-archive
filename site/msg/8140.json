Meredith (Maury&#39;s PA) was \ngreat to work with .. and honestly .. she didn&#39;t freak out as much as \nI did!  There was a lot going on including a member of my Team got \nwacked in the leg ... We have lots more video, evp&#39;s and pictures to \npost on my site .. It was just plain creepy!  Chris filmed that \napparition as soon as we walked in the door so I knew we were in for \na terrifying night...\n\nDebbie\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rhonda W &lt;rhondak1973@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Debbie,\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Great clip thanks for sharing that.  Got some good EVPs there and \nthe image on tv was  good too. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   But I gotta ask ya....did that Meredith gal bug ya with, what \nseemed like, constant freaking out? Maybe its just the way they \nedited the show, but she seemed to freak out over everything.  Was it \nreally as often as they showed it to be or was it more of their \ncreative editing handywork?\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Rhonda\n&gt; \n&gt; misujoey &lt;Debbie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Here&#39;s the link to one segment ...\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.thehauntingevidence.com/easternstatepennitentiary.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Debbie\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;misujoey&quot; &lt;Debbie@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jeffrey Wands, my Paranormal Team T.H.E.M. and I investigated \nEastern \n&gt; &gt; State Penitentiary with the Maury Show Producers.
