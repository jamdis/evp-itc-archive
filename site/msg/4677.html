About the Luminator....I have seen Luminator pictures where the 
ceiling light was displaced and somewhat distorted. If whatever the 
Luminator does can displace a ceiling light, surely it can also 
displace a human face.

&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know as there are &quot;hundreds&quot; of examples available to 
the  
&gt; &gt; public in the way of Luminator photographs,
&gt; 
&gt; I didn&#x27;t say that. I said there are hundreds of examples on line 
of  
&gt; known long exposures. When even a few of these are compared with  
&gt; Luminator examples, I see a tremendous similarity. Do you?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; but there are a couple of dozen in Macy&#x27;s book, &quot;Spirit Faces,&quot; 
and  
&gt; &gt; yes, many many of them are open to wide interpretation,
&gt; 
&gt; Does that mean that you agree with my point? Because, as I reason  
&gt; it,  they are either spirit extras or they aren&#x27;t. They can&#x27;t sort-
of  
&gt; be spirit extras. I&#x27;m not sure what other interpretations there 
might  
&gt; be in this instance.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; just as our humble recordings are.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   In addition to that majority that make us say, &quot;Come on!{&quot; 
there  
&gt; &gt; are a handful that make you say &quot;Hmmmmmmm. . . .&quot; Just like we  
&gt; &gt; offer a handful of results from our endless recording efforts to  
&gt; &gt; try to convince the hard-nosed.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;d agree with you wholeheartedly, if I had ever seen one that 
did,  
&gt; in fact, make me go, &quot;Hmmmm.&quot; As I said, I have never seen one 
where  
&gt; the sitter and the extra did not share a consistent set of 
features  
&gt; and coloring. If you have any examples that do, and you can share  
&gt; them, I&#x27;d be delighted to see them. I&#x27;d like my opinion to be 
swayed.  
&gt; Really, I would.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would think that many would see the Luminator efforts as a 
modern  
&gt; &gt; effort at scrying.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you mean scrying as in the psychomanteum method developed by  
&gt; Raymond Moody? My understanding, from attending a presentation by 
Dr.  
&gt; Moody, was that the psychomanteum produced full-blown apparitions  
&gt; that could converse with the bereaved. Not sure these two types of  
&gt; events are comparable.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Everything we do crosses boundaries, and my point is that it&#x27;s  
&gt; &gt; really hard to walk the line between trying to be scientific and  
&gt; &gt; trying to be open.  It&#x27;s really, really hard! But if we give in 
one  
&gt; &gt; area, we have to be willing to give in another.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t think that is arguably true, Ursula. If the evidence 
appears  
&gt; good, I acknowledge it; if the evidence appears weak, I 
acknowledge  
&gt; it. It is simply not true to say that a person cannot be both open- 
&gt; minded and scientific. I really do want to believe, but I won&#x27;t  
&gt; believe just because I want to. And because you, me, or anyone  
&gt; &quot;gives&quot; in one area, does not make a phenomenon any more or less 
real.
&gt; 
&gt; Your fellow traveler on this journey,
&gt; 
&gt; Ann

&gt; &gt; This is a classic example of the kind of photo that Mark thinks 
shows
&gt; &gt; a spirit extra. To me, clearly, this is the same woman--same hair,
&gt; &gt; same eyes, same mouth, same nose. Again, to me, it looks like a
&gt; &gt; classic long exposure when compared with other known long 
exposures--
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve included just of hundreds of examples.
