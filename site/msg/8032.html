  I sent you a nice email reply to the other post =)
   
  I think everyone here has the opportunity to learn from each other just as much as learn from those on the other side. Actually I have been studying box research since meeting Frank many moons ago =) I just progressed beyond the point of thinking I "need" a "box" for in depth communication. 
   
  Manual sweep works quite well =) If anyone ever will listen to Frank Sumption or "hear" what he says, then you will know that even Frank says he often gets better voices other ways than using his box all the time.
   
  So I appreciate your offer as I appreciate others here who have offered me one but honestly yall I dont "need" it. Theres only one box that has my interest and Frank knows which # that is. And really I only have interest in that # because they mentioned it a very long time ago in evp. Perhaps it is just a marker for progress being made I dunno. We shall see! I asked him to hold on to that one to use himself if it ever gets made/finished. I wanna hear alot of the results from it.
   
  Everyone is free to post thier opinions and feel free to differ from my point of view and form your own, that is what everyone is meant to do in life. So just try what ya can, find what suits your needs, and learn as you go. Everyone here is learning. Nobody is an expert. So just enjoy sharing with each other and try better communication methods on this side as well as the other =)

          misty,

I too a moment to think about it and realized that you and a couple 
of others here where very beneficial in my early stages of box 
research.

I would like to thank you for that initial help.

If it were not for those beginning bits of knowledge I could never 
have reached the plateau in this field that I currently enjoy.

I guess the old biblical adage is correct "give a man a fish and you 
feed him for a day" "teach a man to fish and you feed him for a 
lifetime"

I am sure that your and the groups help at the very beginning has 
helped make me the best box fisherman in the world today.

I would in closing like to extend the same courtesy. If you or any of 
the other original people who put me on the correct path, ever have 
any questions or need any help please let me know. I would be honored.

Oh yes I almost forgot, I know you have never done box research and 
do not own one. If you ever decide to give it a try I think I have an 
old 12-469 I'm not using, your more than welcome to it.

And all the help you need to get started. I would be glad to return 
the favor.

your friend
Bruce
