<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m completely new to this, but I&#x27;ve had some really good success, so I&#x27;ll answer a couple of your questions per my own experiences so far -- see below:


&gt; What I do want to ask, and maybe someone could explain for me, what *is* the benefit of asking the Box a question.
 
For me, I have an agenda:  I want to speak to my dead father and brother.  Since I haven&#x27;t had success with that so far, I&#x27;m speaking to anyone I get, which so far claims to be a guy named Steve, a guy named Frank, someone named Chris, two dead friends of my father&#x27;s whom I didn&#x27;t know where dead (Gordy and Greg), my grandmother (Margaret), and possibly two people named Ed.  I ask questions of these entities in an effort to find out what&#x27;s become of my father and brother, who both died suddenly, and just generally to try to prove life after death.

&gt; Also - and please don&#x27;t anyone yell at me, when I see the video&#x27;s, &gt; I see people on occasion grasping at what they think they might hear.
 
When I started, I expected crisp, clean words, or I wouldn&#x27;t accept them as words; I wasn&#x27;t going to bend noise into what I wanted to hear.  Then I started to realize that &quot;they&quot; couldn&#x27;t make the right words crisp and clear every time; I realized this because I was hearing patterns, the same or nearly the same things over and over, but each set slightly different.  So yes, I do accept slightly garbled versions of words, and don&#x27;t expect to hear a perfect sentence -- but usually the answer is repeated two or three times in a row.  For instance, I recorded them saying different versions of &quot;I love you,&quot; -- all with the clear word love -- twelve different times in a row.  Even though only a few were crisp, clear &quot;I love you&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;love you&#x27;s&quot;, you could tell that all twelve were trying to say the same thing.

&gt; Extrapolate if you will, , when you use the Box, am I correct in 
&gt; understanding that you record the raw data, clean it up, and then listen to it.

I do not clean anything.  I tape onto regular, old-fashioned tape with a four-track machine meant for music.
 
&gt; Do you use it to prove or disprove spirit in a particular location?

I use it on my dining room table.

&gt; Does one hear more &#x27;male&#x27; or &#x27;female&#x27; sounding voices, can on determine the gender of the voice?

I have heard both male and female, which seems to be independent of the radio clips -- these are robotic-sounding voices that are distinctly different and have a quality of their own.  The voices seemed sex-appropriate.

That&#x27;s my two cents.</pre>
