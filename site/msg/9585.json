Can you send some more info or a link?\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Bryan\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dead.science&quot; &lt;dead.science@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Just finished box number 3.  And yes that&#39;s a trifield meter built in.\n&gt;&gt;  It seems to work great.  Once the meter shows any EMF field at all\n&gt;&gt; the box starts to spit out the allophones.  The meter also has a very\n&gt;&gt; sensitive antenna and it is tied together with the\n&gt;&gt;  A to D converter antenna that I use to get the emf into the box.\n&gt;&gt; This is by far the most sensitive of the three boxes.  If you are\n&gt;&gt; building your own just let me know if you need any info.  I will of\n&gt;&gt; course upload audio files as I get them.  I did have a few headaches\n&gt;&gt; with this box as I am driving the LM386 all the way up.  Somehow the\n&gt;&gt; audio was getting back into the negative bus!  Took a couple hours to\n&gt;&gt; get the right capacitor for the ground shunt.  Funny though as it\n&gt;&gt; worked great on the breadboard but once I soldered it together\n&gt;&gt; UHHHGGG.  I think I will hang onto this one  for a while.  I have\n&gt;&gt; young lady in mind that is doing very promising work so I guess she\n&gt;&gt; gets box # 1.\n&gt;&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links"}
