I should have worded that better.  What happened was that during and after
the sageing the energy really kicked it up several notches.  I had placed
my emf meter on the end of my daughters bed.  While sageing, I felt an
electrical type feeling start up the back of my hands..going all the way
to my chest.  At that time, the emf meter had a sustained, high reading.
We continued to sage, and the emf meter was just buried in its
readings.... I left the house...leaving the emf meter on and placing a dvr
on the bed also....we came back a couple hours later...the emf was reading
the usual low reading, and upon playback of the dvr you could hear the
beeping of my emf meter go crazy for about 20 minutes..after which it did
not beep again.  So, I think the sageing actually stirred up the
entity....
