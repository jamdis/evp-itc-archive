me assume that an 'air person' could be the 'humans' (as has also been referenced) who 
are using their 'air portals' - thereby making us 'air people' ... not necessarily that we 
breath air, which could be the case as well, but I'm sort of leaning toward this term being a 
reference of communication. 

If we "enter their air" through "air portals" and they "give us air" for communication, I think 
that makes us "air people" in their frame of reference. But really, that's just a guess.
