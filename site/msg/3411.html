  Jeff...others...As you guys know Frank Sumption is never gonna say yes send me anything...if you wanna do somethin nice for Frank you pretty much DONT ASK just DO it hehehe.He wont take money for his hard efforts nor his out of pocket expenses and if you ask him does he want a gift the answers always gonna be "no dont waste money on me" type thing...So if you guys want him to try something out or send him somethin nice just look him up, and mail it without askin him or givin him the chance to say no
