<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think science is quite capable of describing what is going on with
EVP/ITC, and able to test it .The problem being, a few who have
commented here accept no evidence. It&#x27;s not a discussion of whether or not
science can tackle the afterlife, it&#x27;s an arguement about what is acceptable
to think about.

 There is more than enough &quot;evidence&quot; to show this stuff is not imagination.


 I get voices via &quot;the broken radio&quot; that use words not allowed on broadcast
radio to show it is not radio broadcast fragments, or imagination. Yet, not
enough for these so called skeptics, or the issue is sidestepped/ignored. I
submit there is proof, proof that something talks that is not supposed to be
there.

 If a stranger tells you his name, do you automatically assume he must be
lying? If a spirit tells you who he is, must you assume it&#x27;s a lie, or
worse? Why, because, somehow we know better? If a voice claims to be an ET,
it has to be lying. Why? Because we all that is not possible.

&gt;  I would like to try to address some of the themes that have been going
&gt; back and
&gt; forth in this forum of late; specifically, the state of science and the
&gt; real explanatory
&gt; power,  or lack thereof, it truly has.
&gt;
&gt; Two highly respected parapsychologists recently published an interesting
&gt; book
&gt; called &quot;Handbook to the Afterlife&quot;. They are Dr. Pamela Rae Heath and Dr.
&gt; Jon
&gt; Klimo. (Frank don&#x27;t even THINK of hitting the Reply button quite yet.) In
&gt; this book,
&gt; they have distilled hundreds of channeled messages from many centuries in
&gt; an
&gt; attempt to present a comprehensive mixture of what these message might tell
&gt; us about the nature of death and the afterlife. Heath and Klimo clearly
&gt; state that
&gt; this book is not for everyone. It is for those who find the topic
&gt; interesting and
&gt; wonder what has been learned from such  communications. Clearly those who
&gt; doubt such communications are possible or who disbelieve in the concept of
&gt; afterlife probably will have no use for this book.
&gt;
&gt; Here are two well-known scientists (in the Parapsychology community) who
&gt; acknoweldge that sometimes it is more important to suggest what might be
&gt; possible than to stand only on that which is empirically proveable. The
&gt; very
&gt; nature of science is to explain where possible and to recognize that quite
&gt; often the right answer to many questions is &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Dr. Julie Beischel and Dr. Gary Schwartz have conducted extensive research
&gt; into mediumship. What that research has demonstrated is that there are
&gt; people who can know things they should not with no known ways of this
&gt; happening. This is called &#x27;anomalous information reception&#x27; in
&gt; Parapsychology.
&gt; The point is that we know this anomalous ability exists. What we do not
&gt; know, from the Science, is whether discarnate entities are communicating.
&gt; Certainly the research mediums involved believe so, such is the nature of
&gt; their compelling experiences. But the Science cannot, to date, support
&gt; the claim. And that is what is critical to understand here.
&gt;
&gt; At the same time, it is important to recognize that using technology does
&gt; not necessarily imply the Scientific Method nor does is mean one is doing
&gt; Science. What it does mean is that a part of the experience is documented
&gt; and that might be useful at some future time when Science does have the
&gt; tools and understanding to further evaluate the documents. Today this is,
&gt; unfortunately, simply not true.
&gt;
&gt; What is known is that people are recording audio and video and believe
&gt; they have captured anomalies. Many people think these represent voices
&gt; of spirits and loved ones. Unfortuantely the pure truth is that Science is
&gt; simply not in a position to validate this at this time. But that does not
&gt; mean anyone should stop, nor that anyone should feel they have no reason
&gt; to guess what might be going on, or to speculate about the phenomena.
&gt;
&gt; It also means that cynics and skeptics who demand proof are going to
&gt; have a hard time finding it. If Science is not yet able to describe what it
&gt; is that is going on, skeptics and cynics have no way to determine what
&gt; is absolute proof. They can however choose to accept some personal
&gt; variant of their own truth as acceptable proof should they so desire.
&gt; But this is not empirical proof as required by Science.
&gt;
&gt; Dr. Donald Hoffman is an expert on visual perception and is one of
&gt; the authors of &quot;Conscious Realism&quot; - a scientific theory of reality
&gt; which is the first to solve the mind/body problem. Dr. Hoffman is one
&gt; scientist who completely understands how people misperceive things,
&gt; and yet his controversial theories challenge even some of the world&#x27;s
&gt; leading theoretical physicists when it comes to understanding. Clearly
&gt; there are scientists who appreciate this phenomena may well be real.
&gt; I have personal dialogs with them frequently. You would simply not
&gt; believe how frustrating it is for someone whose job it is to explain
&gt; the world to others to have no idea whatsoever what might be going
&gt; on here.
&gt;
&gt; I hope this helps put a face on Science, and that I have succintly
&gt; but  clearly explained why Science offers no magic explanations
&gt; at this time. And at the same time, perhaps this will better set
&gt; expectations for everyone while recognizing that the work being
&gt; done here may well have potential merit in the due course of time.

The poin is ha we know his anomalous abili y exis s. Wha we do no

A he same ime, i is impo an o ecognize ha using echnology does

I also means ha cynics and skep ics who demand p oo a e going o
