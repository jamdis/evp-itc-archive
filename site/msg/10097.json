What has\nbeen your technical set-up? Was the &quot;buzzing&quot; sound modulated all the\ntime or only if &quot;they&quot; were speaking?\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; This was my first Spiricom capture from over a month ago. The voice is\n&gt; a monotone however the use of the word &quot;Spiricom&quot; in the very first\n&gt; message I received is intriguing. &quot;Dave this is Spiricom one&quot;"}
