I have said that about these predictions, Who the hell are you, me, or anyone to say they some how know better, that nothing is going to happen? So all of this EVP stuff, along with every f----- culture on the planet has to be wrong-- cuz you somehow, in your infinite wisdom know better. \n\n I can not in good conscience, believe that I know better about the doomes day voices and not post them. You like many, I am just not wise enough to know what ifs false and waht is true from the boxes. It&#39;s not just a mayn thing, it&#39;s world wide, so how the fuck do you know it&#39;s not true!!  I have done that before, gotten clear voices that I just knew had ot be worng, so didn&#39;t post them, when it would have proven EVP.\n\n As far your boxes, I can&#39;t help what you paid, you didn&#39;t get them from me. I can&#39;t help the fact that guy you bought them from was a crook and thought he deserved more for the damn things. If I had money I would pay you back, but I&#39;m old, retired and get half of what I ued to for income. Contrary to to waht you might think, I barely get enoiugh for this junkl to buy parts, labor isn&#39;t even counted in! There is no fucking profit in this crap! I can&#39;t help that you were so desperate for boxes that price was no object--at the time. You&#39;ll have to blame yourself for your own poor judgement. I have stated, again for freaking years, that there is no magic in the box, it&#39;s a goddamn radio!! Any, and I mean any method of sweeping the tuning results in the raw audio and if &quot;they&quot; deem you worthy, the spirits might talk to you, but there is no gaurantee! Not my probelm that you thought you were so gifted and unique that God himself would have to talk to you. \n\n You should choose you next words carefully! Or you could just quit the group since you are obviously so much more intelluigent than anyone here.\n\n Frank-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Mvanah Maloti &lt;inyanga4@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank&#39;s words, not mine. \n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Run Frank, run!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 3/1/11, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Where is Frank ?\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, March 1, 2011, 7:34 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; then you wonder why he doesn&#39;t answer question...lol\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 3/1/11, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Where is Frank ?\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, March 1, 2011, 8:32 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; your on his group talking crap about him..wtf? some people\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 3/1/11, Mvanah Maloti &lt;inyanga4@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Mvanah Maloti &lt;inyanga4@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Where is Frank ?\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, March 1, 2011, 8:15 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nah, I&#39;m just waiting for 2012 so I can get a front row seat to Frank&#39;s pity party and making good on his promise to run over ALL of his boxes with his car if the world doesn&#39;t explode. \n&gt;  \n&gt; And I&#39;m the idiot? \n&gt;  \n&gt; LMFAO!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 3/1/11, Rick Wegrzyn &lt;rickwegrzyn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Rick Wegrzyn &lt;rickwegrzyn@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Where is Frank ?\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, March 1, 2011, 7:11 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You r 1 of those idiots yes..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Mvanah Maloti &lt;inyanga4@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Tue, March 1, 2011 7:07:15 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Where is Frank ?\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You seem to think this group is about &quot;helping&quot; new GB users and (ahem) &quot;researchers.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Methinks you have another thing coming, kiddo.  ;)\n&gt;  \n&gt; -J\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Mon, 2/28/11, Luis &lt;luispucp098@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Luis &lt;luispucp098@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Where is Frank ?\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Monday, February 28, 2011, 7:51 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I asked almost 3 questions , and are waiting the answer\n&gt;"}
