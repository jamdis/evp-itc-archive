&gt; Hello Marie
&gt; 
&gt; I took the time to listen to one of your videos on youtube that you 
posted. It turned out quite well. I think manual sweep works great. I 
have been doing ITC work for a few years now. I post a few things 
online now and then in my galleries. You can access those from my 
webpage
&gt; 
&gt; http://misty.xm.com
&gt; 
&gt; and a few more things are posted on 
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.bestpsychicnetwork.info/profile/Misty
&gt; 
&gt; Keep up the good work!

&gt; &gt; Hi Misty,
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the reply, i too enjoy the manual method of
&gt; &gt; getting itc/evp
&gt; &gt; then again i cannot afford to get anything other than
&gt; &gt; that!! But i do 
&gt; &gt; think that if i am gettting such great results using this
&gt; &gt; method, 
&gt; &gt; then why change? I have such specific results...getting the
&gt; &gt; wonderful 
&gt; &gt; spirits that visit me to repeat words...and they have said
&gt; &gt; things to 
&gt; &gt; me that wewe to specific to just be radio
&gt; &gt; chatter...including both 
&gt; &gt; mine and my fiance&#x27;s nicknames as children. (both VERY
&gt; &gt; strange 
&gt; &gt; names!!!)I have had accusations that i fake it, but to be
&gt; &gt; honest 
&gt; &gt; other than the fact i wouldnt know how to fake it, i have
&gt; &gt; no desire 
&gt; &gt; to do so, being slightly sceptical when i started doing
&gt; &gt; this, i have 
&gt; &gt; been blown away by the results i have acheived!!
&gt; &gt; As i mentioned before i have some videos on
&gt; &gt; youtube(mazblondie) and 
&gt; &gt; it would be FANTASTIC if you could take a look and see what
&gt; &gt; you think.
&gt; &gt; Have you been recording long?
&gt; &gt; Do you have any video;s recordings to listen to??
&gt; &gt; Marie
&gt;
Thanks misty willl take a look x</pre>
