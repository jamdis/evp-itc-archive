I also heard someone in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; background singing &quot; Happy Birthday &quot; too. How cool is that, no \n&gt; &gt; coincidence seems like to me. Here is another story I was watching \n&gt; TV \n&gt; &gt; the Grammy Awards and when Little Richard and Jerry lee Lewis was \n&gt; on \n&gt; &gt; there was another singer with them from Credence Clearwater Revival \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t remember his name. So as I was listening to the spirits I \n&gt; &gt; heard a voice today say &quot; John Fogerty &quot; is that his name I think \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; is? How cool was that ? Oh well just some stuff to ponder on. You \n&gt; all \n&gt; &gt; have a great evening.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ralph the Ghost Hunter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
