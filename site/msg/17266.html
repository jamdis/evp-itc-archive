no=C2=A0review.=C2=A0 There is no review because there is no hard evidence =
to support the claims.=C2=A0 Now that is not to say it doesn't or can not h=

But what I am going to say is that if you want this to be looked at=
 in a serious light, you need to stop attacking skeptical review.=C2=A0 Bec=
ause anything that is posted here is candy land compared to the alternative=

They will eat you alive, and they will have cause at this point to do so=

Science is a cold hearted bitch Frank, as she should be.
