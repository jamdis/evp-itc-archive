I like how your crew sounds is more personal than mine when they let you
know they are ready to start.  Your sample, &quot;Hello, people are here&quot; is a
nice example.  My &quot;Now&quot; guy sounds very brusque but I have become used to
him.  Interestingly, I have never had anyone from the other side tell me
when a session is over.  I always have to end the session or they would
continue talking to me forever.  About 70% of the time when I try to end a
session I get a very clear &quot;wait&quot; because they have something else to say.

&gt; Tim,
&gt;
&gt; I experience something similar on a regular basis.
&gt;
&gt; My &quot;crew&quot; usually begins immediately (sometimes less than 20 or 30 seconds
&gt; and often as soon as the box is turned on) with my name and the words *
&gt; &quot;START&quot;,* *&quot;Here&quot;* or *&quot;Hello&quot;* to show me that we&#x27;ve made proper contact
&gt; and the connection is clear.
&gt;
&gt; The sessions typically end in much the same way with a loud* &quot;STOP!&quot;* or *
&gt; &quot;end&quot;* to signal that we&#x27;re finished.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve attached an example of my own and thank you for sharing!
&gt;
&gt; It&#x27;s incredibly interesting to read about and hear the communication
&gt; &quot;systems&quot; employed by other researchers.
