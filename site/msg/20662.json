I was introduced to the ghost box at a paranormal group meeting, but ever since then the vast majority of my sessions have been at home.  I went to a few cemeteries at midnight at first, but that quickly wore off when I realized that I get equal, and even better, communication, just sitting at the dining room table.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  My approach to EVP and ITC is for spirit communcation not associated with supposed hauntings. That&#39;s why I find it frustrating that most insist on running aorund in the dark to get evidence and EVP when they could stay home and get much more. Spirits and entities travel, even the ones that are supposedly stuck will come to you if asked. I don&#39;t like the Halloween, and fear crap. I think most just want to be frightened, so they pay gigabucks to go the haunted hot spots hoping beyond hope to get scared out their wits by imaginary demons.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
