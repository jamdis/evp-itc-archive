<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is an interesting conversation.  Personally, I use my hack to
communicate with a spirit who is definitely grounded.  Sometimes the
communications come through as bits of radio waves put together to
form words or sentences, and other times, they sound more like
traditional evps.  One of the little things I&#x27;m trying to figure out
is why I could never get evps from him after a year of trying, but he
has taken to communicating through the box like a fish to water.
