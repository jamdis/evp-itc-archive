<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Some of my best EVP&#x27;s so far were obtained in the former Manteno State 
Mental Hospital in Illinois.  There are evidently a LOT of spirits around 
that site.  And they may be dead but they&#x27;re still insane.

&gt; I find cemetery EVP to be the most fascinating because they seem to offer a 
&gt; glimpse into a chaotic and not-so-pretty part of the After Life that very few 
&gt; are willing to look at. Our cemeteries seem to me to truly be cities of the
