<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey, thanks Margaret.  I will look for it.  I asked about a cord for 
that yesterday when I was there and bought the 20-125 I am working on.

They said no, there was nothing that would do that.  I am going to go 
back and talk to someone else now!  Thank you very much.

I have audacity on my computer, just haven&#x27;t used it yet.  So if I 
use that, I don&#x27;t even really need a patch cord?  Just the mic?
I am VERY new to this....can&#x27;t you tell?  ;)

&gt; Hi Laura.  There&#x27;s a patch cord available from radio shack for 
about $5.  You connect one 
&gt; end to the ear jack of the recorder and the other to the &#x27;sound in&#x27; 
on the computer.  I use 
&gt; a freeware program called Audacity to record.  Just play the file 
into the computer (rather 
&gt; than doing an actual transfer).  Hope this helps some.
