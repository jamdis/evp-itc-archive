I met him about 3 years ago.  \nMy husband is a commercial photographer and Mark asked him to do his  \nportrait for a book he was coming out with. He came to our home studio  \nfor the portrait, and I got to talk with him a little about what he  \ndoes. At that time all I knew of EVP was from the White Noise movie,  \nwasn&#39;t sure it was real. But Mark was very nice, passionate about ITC/ \nEVP and very convincing. I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to expect when I  \noriginally heard what he did, with all the loonies out there claiming  \nall kinds of stuff, but I got a really good feeling from him and he&#39;s  \nvery, well, like I said, convincing. After that I went to his web site  \nand also bought one of his books, which was a nice read.\n\nI went to the Stanley Hotel in November with a ghost hunting group and\nMark was a speaker there. I was really looking forward to his lecture,  \nbut ended up with a wicked stomach virus and had to come home early. I  \nmissed just about everything that weekend!\n\nDeb T\n\n\n\nOn Dec 29, 2007, at 9:51 AM, Ursula Bielski wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Oops.  I forgot to answer: No, I have not given up ghost hunting at  \n&gt; all, but over the years I have come to focus more on the collection  \n&gt; and distribution of experiences than on encountering phenomena  \n&gt; myself.  ITC has really affirmed this for me.\n&gt; I&#39;ve felt all along that my job is to make people aware that  \n&gt; spiritual phenomena go on all the time in millions of lives; I&#39;m not  \n&gt; a scientist and I know nothing I do will change the way science  \n&gt; thinks.  BUT if I can open the minds of young people today, perhaps  \n&gt; our future scientists will make it their business to figure all this  \n&gt; out.\n&gt; I know this is a lot of what ITC experimenters are doing: convincing  \n&gt; others of the afterlife by their recorded evidence.  Amazing things  \n&gt; can happen when THAT happens.\n&gt; Again, Mark Macy is so wonderful because he has dedicated his life  \n&gt; to this.  He and his colleagues have received such detailed  \n&gt; descriptions of how the afterlife works, that they have helped the  \n&gt; living change their lives to erase the fear of death--and to live in  \n&gt; a way that brings us to as high a spiritual level as possible right  \n&gt; away when our bodies die.  This means, for example, dealing with  \n&gt; issues and addictions, that plague us in life, since the spirits  \n&gt; tell us we take it all with us!  That is, death isn&#39;t a cure-all.\n&gt; Any glimpse at the history of ITC shows us that all of this has been  \n&gt; gradually growing since the 19th century, when state-of-the-art  \n&gt; graphite pencils and telegraphs were used to contact the dead.   \n&gt; Since then, there have been &quot;breakthroughs&quot; a number of times when  \n&gt; astounding floods of messages have come through.\n&gt; You experimenters are all so incredible--I&#39;m amazed every day at  \n&gt; your love, dedication and faith.  Surely something wonderful is  \n&gt; going to come from all this, and I think it&#39;s going to come during  \n&gt; our lifetimes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ursula\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Robin Searcy Henson &lt;MudPuddleFarm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello Bill,\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, I did steal that phrase from Ursula because I thought it  \n&gt; described what I was doing as compared to what I would like to be  \n&gt; doing!\n&gt;\n&gt; I like what you said about focus on the equipment helping to  \n&gt; establish the psychic connection.  It makes so much sense.  This  \n&gt; discussion has definitely shown me that mental tools and preparation  \n&gt; are as important as physical ones.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you for your input.\n&gt;\n&gt; Robin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: psi_research\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Friday, December 28, 2007 9:37 PM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Digital Voice Recorder Advice\n&gt;\n&gt; oops. I see it was Ursula who posted the &quot;r vs. r&quot; statement. And\n&gt; Ursula your post is so much more eloquent and you&#39;ve articulated the\n&gt; point much better than I could. I&#39;ll bow out of your way -Bill\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Robin,\n&gt; &gt; Your phrase of &quot;ritualized vs. random&quot; is interesting. There are  \n&gt; many\n&gt; &gt; who believe that communication is between the conscious of the\n&gt; &gt; researcher and the entity and the equipment is secondary. It&#39;s  \n&gt; easy to\n&gt; &gt; get swept up in the technology and forget there is possibly a  \n&gt; psychic\n&gt; &gt; connection going on. With that said, focusing on equipment actually\n&gt; &gt; can help the researcher become receptive to establishing a\n&gt; &gt; communication link. While paying attention to the equipment, we  \n&gt; forget\n&gt; &gt; about the daily distractions and minor irritations that may  \n&gt; prevent us\n&gt; &gt; from establishing contact.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The setting up the gear we use could be considered the first part of\n&gt; &gt; the &quot;ritual&quot;. I like to clear my mind, set up equipment, mess with  \n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; some more, then I am mentally prepare to begin what I hope will be a\n&gt; &gt; successful session.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I guess &quot;random&quot; recording to me would be what happens in the field\n&gt; &gt; during a paranormal investigation. I don&#39;t bring Box technology  \n&gt; into a\n&gt; &gt; location with the intention of possibly contacting lingering spirits\n&gt; &gt; at that location but I do bring audio recorders in hopes of  \n&gt; recording\n&gt; &gt; evp&#39;s.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I find the Box works perhaps even better when I&#39;m in a familiar  \n&gt; place\n&gt; &gt; like the room in my home that is designated for that purpose. I do\n&gt; &gt; desire to have the finest Box technology that is possible but more\n&gt; &gt; important is the association that seems to occur between the\n&gt; &gt; researcher and the Box that is favored. Despite some of the benefits\n&gt; &gt; of the new gear, the one that I seem to have a connection with is  \n&gt; one\n&gt; &gt; that requires a little more finesse to operate. -Bill\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robin Henson&quot; &lt;MudPuddleFarm@&gt;  \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, thanks for your help guys!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ursula, your post was lovely. I&#39;ve been promising myself to learn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more about Mark Macy&#39;s work and will check out his website ASAP.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ritualized versus random recording makes sense to me now, as I  \n&gt; want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to accomplish true communication rather than continue being  \n&gt; verbally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; abused. Have you given up &quot;ghost hunting&quot; altogether?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been looking at the Olympus VN-4100 PC, Zack! I don&#39;t know  \n&gt; if I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; need that much recording time, but I sure have liked the one I  \n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and wouldn&#39;t mind upgrading a bit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Frank! I basically follow your suggestion when recording, and  \n&gt; once\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I learned to be quiet I actually started getting responses. I  \n&gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the entities at my house got tired of playing with me though,  \n&gt; and now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they aren&#39;t saying anything. I kind of miss them, but I do feel  \n&gt; it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time to move on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Robin\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Robin,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Radio Shack now carries the Olympus VN-4100PC at about the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; price I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paid for my VN-960PC a couple years ago. I&#39;ve been very happy  \n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 960. The 4100 has about 4 times the recording time, I think.  \n&gt; That\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make it about 24 hours.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Zack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Sat, 29 Dec 2007, Robin Henson wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to the group but probably know some of you from  \n&gt; another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; list. I haven&#39;t been too active in the realm of EVP recording\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recently, but have had what I consider excellent results in  \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; past\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 PC.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using. I  \n&gt; know a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little about using good headphones and denoiser programs, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beyond\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I&#39;m electronically challenged. Still, I wonder if there  \n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple techniques I can experiment with to increase my  \n&gt; success. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think I&#39;m a little bored.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#39;ve been communicating with  \n&gt; a very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small number of entities, and I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s due to  \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs have  \n&gt; always\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside on the  \n&gt; hill and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near the barn. I&#39;ve gotten two inside my house (after inviting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative\n&gt; &gt; &gt; messages.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;m thinking about getting another DVR and would  \n&gt; love to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are best. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities eventually,  \n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunately don&#39;t have the brain for building anything  \n&gt; myself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
