&gt; Thanks for the feedback everyone!  I&#x27;ll be interested to see what 
&gt; rolls in through the TAPS magazine.  The issue will be featured 
next 
&gt; weekend at the next Ghost Hunters haunted event, at Eastern State 
&gt; Penitentiary in Philly.  People will be getting it, and it&#x27;s sure 
to 
&gt; generate some converation. (Bill, Randy &amp; I will be there).  BTW, 
&gt; Randy alerted me that the hot link for the pdf includes a period 
&gt; which makes it not work, and I don&#x27;t know how to edit the original 
&gt; post, so I would suggest highlighting &amp; cutting the period out.  My 
&gt; apologies.  I fixed it on itcbridge.com under Forum/EVP/Ghost Box.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(Cross posted on itcbridge.com forum)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Mark Macy has posted two articles I wrote about Frank&#x27;s Box,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;concerning the controversy the box has caused in the paranormal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;investigation community.  The articles are published this 
month 
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;TAPS Paramagazine.  The pdf can be viewed at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;http://spiritfaces.com/x200706ParamagArticl.pdf.  For those 
not 
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ghost work, TAPS is The Paranormal Atlantic Society, members 
of 
&gt; whom
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;star in The SciFiChannel&#x27;s  popular Ghost Hunters reality show.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Briefly, at a Ghost Hunters haunted week at The Stanley Hotel 
in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Colorado in March, the 200+ attendees were given 
demonstrations 
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the box by Chris Moon.  There were two open mike nights in 
which 
&gt; lots
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;were drawn for people to come up and ask questions via the box.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Chris interpreted answers, and was assisted by medium Chip 
&gt; Coffey.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Many of the attendees had never heard of the box, and most of 
&gt; them
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;had never seen it in operation, and it caused quite a stir.   
&gt; Chris
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;also took the box into one of the hotel&#x27;s more active haunted 
&gt; rooms,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;as part of the featured ghost investigations.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;There were two other boxes present on site for part of the 
time,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;owned by Randy Schneider and Bill Murphy.  Fortunately, these 
&gt; boxes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;were not pressed into service for paranormal tap dancing.  I 
was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;especially happy to be able to participate in small group 
private
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sessions with both Randy and Bill (and one of which included 
&gt; Mark),
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;which I found far more illuminating.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;One article concerns the controversy over the box (for example,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;should it be used in haunted places to provoke ghosts; can it 
&gt; dial up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the dead on demand), and the other is a Q&amp;A interview I did 
with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Frank.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Personally, I agree with Frank&#x27;s vision for the box as an ITC 
&gt; tool.
