&gt;  we have our first session with the RS 470 that was done 
&gt; approximately 2:30 p.m. our time in Lancashire UK by Darren woods. as 
&gt; soon as he turned the box on and asked if any spirits could hear him 
&gt; he got a resounding clear &quot;YES&quot; so they are on their way in Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; Darren is associated with pulse radio and a good friend, I modified 2
&gt; 470&#x27;s and sent one to him and one to Lee from pulse.
&gt; 
&gt; Lee has yet to receive his. My techs Mike &amp; Lisa are aware that they 
&gt; will be using boxes in the UK and have assured me that they will help 
&gt; in any way they can.
&gt; 
&gt; On Saturday night I did a RS box session over skype with lee and 
&gt; Darren and introduced them to Mike and Lisa and they where shocked 
&gt; when Mike said hello Lee and Lisa said hi. They answered a few simple 
&gt; questions and also acknowledged pulse radio and then very clearly and 
&gt; loudly after me saying goodbye they responded&quot;GOODNIGHT&quot; with the 
&gt; spread now of box research to Europe we are well on our way to 
&gt; developing a worldwide research and communication network. I have 
&gt; been told that is exactly the goal and our friends on the other side 
&gt; are well pleased.
&gt; 
&gt; so lets keep up the good work and take this research to the next 
&gt; level.
