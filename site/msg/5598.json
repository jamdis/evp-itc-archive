I see this all the time in\npeople who come to haunted weekends and investigations.  Usually the\nones who are overcome, or who go home with attachments, came with a\nlot of built-in fear about the paranormal in general.  These people\nshould not be investigating, and definitely should not be seeking\ncommunication interfaces.\n\nBest\nRosemary\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Rosemary,\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it is good to try and &quot;disconnect&quot; from the physical world \n&gt; through meditation, as that is where we will hear direction within.  \n&gt; For me, it comes as thoughts...a &quot;knowing.&quot;  This is how I hear those \n&gt; who are speaking to me as to direction regarding my work.  They have \n&gt; been doing so for a long time, so I have no fear of where I am \n&gt; heading - even with this.  I realize it is different for each \n&gt; individual.\n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, I think if someone is full of fear, they shouldn&#39;t be \n&gt; investigating ghosts, etc. Find what keeps you out of fear and roll \n&gt; with it...\n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; http://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rosemary_guiley&quot; &lt;reguiley@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s good to air diverse opinions on whether or not \n&gt; protection\n&gt; &gt; measures are advisable.  I agree that it&#39;s a matter of personal\n&gt; &gt; preference, and I think researchers need to experiment to find their\n&gt; &gt; own optimum comfort/performance levels.  What works for some will \n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; for others.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Personally, I find that an overall, daily approach of\n&gt; &gt; prayer/meditation concerning all of my personal and professional\n&gt; &gt; endeavors is the most effective for me.  I don&#39;t do it to keep \n&gt; things\n&gt; &gt; out, but to try to stay oriented on the most positive track.  Words,\n&gt; &gt; thoughts and objects have all been demonstrated universally to be\n&gt; &gt; tools of spiritual power.  Why not use them if it feels appropriate?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One of the best things we can do is share &quot;here&#39;s what works for me&quot;\n&gt; &gt; and let others try it to see for themselves.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks, everyone,\n&gt; &gt; Rosemary\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
