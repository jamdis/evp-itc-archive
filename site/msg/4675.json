I&#39;ve watched/listened to this video a number of \ntimes and can&#39;t figure out if the participants are actually hearing \nresponses on their own or are totally relying on Chris to interpret for \nthem what is being said.  I&#39;m disappointed because I honestly can&#39;t \nhear the words he&#39;s repeating as being from spirit.\n \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-wQZ7FU2Vc\n\n\nRobin"}
