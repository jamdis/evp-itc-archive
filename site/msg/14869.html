Statistically speaking "the paranormal field" has just as many as=

elves the more bubble-heads we get. Its just a fact of life. How we deal wi=

I'd agree to that. He shares his res=

Hi All
=A0
I have to admit that=
 I share the same opinion as Bruce. I dont what everyones take is on this b=
ut I felt that some of moon and even Franks attitude was slightly arrogant.=
 I am a researcher in the UK using old reel to reel methods and obtaining e=
xcellent results. I lost some family and some close friends=A05 yeara ago=
=A0and suddenly it dawned on me...what is life all about. I went on to rese=
arch every evp pioneer i could, listen to hours/days of recordings and it c=
hanged my outlook on life. tears were turned to smiles and then I realised =
what all this research is for. it was a big step for me spiritually. 
=A0
I=
 dont know if there is anyone else on here using old fashioned methods but =
if anybody would like to hear recordings please ask. I am using a reel to r=
eel sony "Hi frequency" recorder and trying various types of tones, backgro=
unds e.t.c.
=A0
Good luck to everyone with their research, you are right we=
 are changing history we are discovering new things. if it wasnt for indivi=
duals such as raudive, jurghenson to name a few, maybe we wouldnt have disc=
overed this. it takes a brave individual to tackle an arrogant human race b=

guys,

Sorry to bu=
rden you with this nonsense but this group and the RTSC group are my only v=

 you do not mind to much.

Here is a copy of my final personal e-mail to Fr=
ank Sumption which by the way is meant for him but he see's fit to post the=
m publicly in an attempt to discredit me.

I want you to read it first hand=
 so there are no chance of it being altered before it is posted else where.=


I will not address Frank again
------------ --------- --------- ---------=
 --------- --------- -

Frank,

This is getting ridiculous now, you should =
stop writing these posts, all you are doing is making yourself look ridicul=
ous.

I have offered many times to make my raw recordings available for rev=
iew by anyone who wants them. I have made the same challenge to your friend=
 moon who we all know is behind this tirade he has time and again refused o=
r ignored the request for any type of audio file
to be publicly posted for =
revue and continues to take advantage of innocent unsuspecting people with =
his con game and charging large amounts of money for sessions where he fabr=
icates and makes up content as he goes along.

I was the only one to confro=
nt him in public and expose him for the fake he is and this is his feeble a=
ttempt at retaliation. I and other researchers like me have brought this re=
search light years from where it was when you and I first met, moon just co=
ntinues to use it to rip people off and has not contributed a thing to the =
research of ghost box communication beside lining his own pockets. 

Just t=
he fact that he has you doing his dirty work shows the type of guy he is. I=
 can remember a time when you publicly came out against any type of money m=
aking using your boxes and even refused moon when he wanted to manufacture =
and sell them for large profits yet now you condone his robbery of innocent=
 unaware people and actually act foolish on his behest.

Frank you are bett=
er than this, just concentrate on developing a better box and forget about =
moon and his tricks and lies, he is finished in the paranormal and he knows=
 it, everyone is wise to his game and he is practically an outcast.

Frank =
you are hitching you wagon to a dead horse. Get away from these bad influen=
ces before they ruin your reputation as well.

We have had this moon discus=
sion in the past and once he has exhausted his need for you he will screw y=
ou again like he has done so many times before.

Frank, I like and respect =
you and I hope you will consider what I have said in this e-mail and I sinc=
erely hope you post this one on the evp-itc group. I will be posting it on =
my group and others I belong to.

Your former friend
Bruce
