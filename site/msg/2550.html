<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, have you made any appreciable changes to the circuit that&#x27;s in the 
group&#x27;s files folder? Are you using an LA1130 or an LM3820 now? Or 
something else? I&#x27;m having a hard time finding any LA1130&#x27;s.

I&#x27;ve been thinking of making a circuit board for the circuit using 
surface-mount devices.  Now that winter is not all that far off, I&#x27;ll 
probably do this as a winter project. I have a lot of 3mm trimmer pots. 
Those alone would make the circuit a lot smaller.  :-)

Also, if I get a circuit board that works I can run off a moderate number 
of them pretty easily.

&gt; There&#x27;s no echo box, or &#x27;sound chamber&#x27; as I&#x27;ll start calling it.  It&#x27;s function is not to produce an echo, it only seems to help enhance the voices, but it is certainly not needed. The speakers are laying on top of the mics. Some morons do radio shows who have no technical comprehension of this stuff, but will claim to know how it---doesn&#x27;t work-- in most cases, and make public claims about the box&#x27;s function. What they never ever do is ask the one person in the world that might know!

&gt; Curiously in one voice an apple seems to be a truth.
