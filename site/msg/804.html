The Intelligence Project 

A Project involving EVP and Listening

If you have done EVP for a while you will already know whether or 
not what you say is responded to sometimes - you will already know 
if there seems to be some sort of awareness there.

You may believe this to be so, and so may I, but the world in 
general will just take this as further evidence of 
our &quot;deteriorating mental ability&quot;!

You can&#x27;t prove anything - all you can do is state your firm belief 
and perhaps back that up with some examples which you hope don&#x27;t 
sound too &quot;made-up&quot;.

This project aims to deal with that situation once and for all.  We 
believe in working with science rather than against it.  Science is 
not our enemy, nor indeed is scepticism.

Method
What we want to find out is if there is any relationship between 
what the experimenter says and the type of EVP responses that we get.

We are looking for signs of intelligence.

We want to do that in a measurable way - for that is the way of 
science.  And this is the way that has been approved by a major 
European pharmaceutical company for funding.

We have six questions. These questions are decided on in advance.  

During the experiment the experimenter asks each of the questions, 
in turn, with a 30-second gap after each question to allow any 
responses to be recorded. 

So (for example) what you would get is,

Question &#x27;What is the time?&#x27; 
[30 seconds delay]; 
Question &#x27;What is your name?&#x27; 
[30 seconds delay], 
Question &#x27;What do you like best?&#x27;
[30 second delay]
and so on.

Now if an utterance is heard within the 30-second period and if the 
utterance sounds as though it could be a response to the question, 
then it is treated as an actual response.  For example if we hear 
the utterance &#x27;John Smith&#x27; seven seconds after the question &#x27;What is 
your name?&#x27; is asked, then that looks like a response to that 
question.

The experimenter carries out the session, asking each of the 
questions in turn; and then the recording of the session is turned 
over to a speech analyst.

The analyst picks out from the general background noise all the 
utterances he can find in the recording.  He refines his search 
still further by selecting out the 16 utterances of the best 
quality. (sometimes it will be less than 16), and &quot;shuffles&quot; these 
so that you will not know which came first, which came second and so 
on.

The final 16 utterances, their order shuffled, are sent out to you.

What you are asked to do is decide if any of the utterances could be 
a response to any of the questions, and to fill in a table like that 
shown in the example below.

Track No.	Could be a response to Question Number..
BR01	                               4
BR02	                               0
BR03	                               0
BRO4	                               3
BR05	                               1
BR06	                               2
BR07	                               3
BRO8	                               3
BR09	                               6
BR10	                               0
BR11	                               0
BR12	                               0
BR13	                               6
BR14	                               5
BR15	                               0
BR16	                               0
 
As you can see some utterances are not considered to be a response 
to any of the questions, and so a &#x27;0&#x27; is inserted at that point.  
This is not an easy test, that is why you are being asked to help.

Please send your results to XXX@... and then they will get put 
into our database - and in time we will be told the results.

Meanwhile, however, preliminary results look quite promising  and 
your assistance on this vital project is very much appreciated!
