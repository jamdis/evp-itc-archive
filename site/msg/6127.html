I am posting two short sessions for hopefully others to comment on.  This is completed with a RS 469 going directly into my handheld digital recorder.  Coincidentally, I am outside in a light rain so maybe it is ideal for me here in Mexico where I get few signals.
  At first I thought I heard the word BUENO (hello in Spanish) but I now hear DINO with is my wife's name...short for Dinorah.  She is normally not with me for sessions and was not with me for this session so I doubt what I am hearing.  Any comments would be appreciated.  
  The other recording I hear the name HELEN.  I don't know anyone with that name.  Ron L
