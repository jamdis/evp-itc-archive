   My Ghos=
tman box. Or a swept tuned Walkman. I've been thinking about the Mini box, =
and we've shown on this group that the sound chamber I use is definately no=
t needed, so that eliminates the mics and added amps as well. I kinda misse=
d the manufacturing boat by not doing more testing, or being stuck on a con=
cept. Not that I'm all that concerned, I had no desire to make money off th=
is stuff, and that probelm seems to have been solved. 
   Despite concerns =
by the more conserative researchers, I guess I could call them, I have neve=
r seen any one harmed by any kind of oracle device(granted-I don't get out =
much).  I think getting this stuff out there in the public is a good thing.=
