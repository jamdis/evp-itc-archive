Sometimes its a clear conversation, voices I recognize, names I recognize, my full name being said used in a proper sentence. Other times its very random and fragmented. What you want to look for is that as you manually sweep the voices carry on thier sentence and often remain in the same voice or speak together in conversation that doesnt stop as you sweep the entire band.\n   \n  Last time my whole session was one long conversation in a voice that remained pretty constant. The time before that it was different voices jumping in taking turns to say hello or give a message. As with most methods I never know what I am gonna get until playback.\n   \n  For radio I just sweep until I hear my name spoken then I zone in on that area if they are saying &quot;right here&quot; &quot;go back&quot; or slower/faster higher/lower... I do hear instruction sometimes as I do it. I cant say the experience will be the same for everyone but I can say its easy enough that anyone can try it. Just sweep fast enough you dont lock onto any one station and slow enough that it allows the static to do its thing...what thing...you will see.\n   \n  Above all have fun and dont take anything you hear &quot;too&quot; serious just seek to be positive and learn and they will do the rest.\n   \n  Oh and ya may wanna turn down the recording mic to about 7 (1-10) to allow better feedback to come thru (static) that wont kill you to analyze afterwords.\n   \n  Misty\n\nbhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n          hi, I gave the sweep tuning method a try today and captured what could \nhave been random words but then again they could have been my mind \ntrying to piece together random its of noise into words.
