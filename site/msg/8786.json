The other i heard &quot;He&#39;s&quot; and &quot;The Voltage&quot;, but didn&#39;t catch the &quot;Checking&quot; part.  All in all, sounds like a &quot;Frank&#39;s Box&quot; to me.  Although boxes automate the raw material, i&#39;m finding that other methods prove success as well.  Even traditional EVP with my Panasonic rr-dr60 is proving to be a positive attribute.  I think once they get in touch with your life signature or aura or whatever they see in us, you can use any method and get great results.  I have used every box and method known and have had success with every one, i keep all my files backed up from this journey for future reference.  My problem is that i don&#39;t stay on one style of EVP, i keep jumping around to try new things.  I also have another small project in the works, an idea i passed by Stefan the other day.  I bought an old pocket pc off Ebay that i didn&#39;t get yet.  It is a bit older and has a windows CE based program\n installed on it, Stefan seems to believe that EvpMaker might work on that kind of palm pilot because it is a C+++ designed program.  Well, in a couple days i will let you guys know if it works.  If it does, it could be a handheld unit to bring out on location and it has already proved to work great for me and some other researchers on here.\n   \n  -Steve H.\n\n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  Create a Home Theater Like the Pros.
