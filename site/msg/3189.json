Last night I finally was able to do it correctly as when I carefully listened back with headphones I heard: YOU ARE STONED, FOR . . . YOU (which sounded like Tiny Tim singing it!?), THE FIRST TIME . . . FOR YOU, then on FM, when I asked, &quot;Is anybody here?&quot; I heard: SHUT . . .UP! LOL  Probably that one was a &quot;Darkie&quot;! Most of the EVP&#39;s/voice messages seemed to be OK and not negative = which is good. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing a lot as they tend to go by too fast and my ears are not used to it, yet! I have the time, daily to do the experimental research on this and hope to continue recording & making notes! Tune in, same time, same station (AM) as they used to say!  Thanks.  =Judy=    P.S. I like the sterio idea & smaller boxes!"}
