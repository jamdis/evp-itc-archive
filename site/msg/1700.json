I have found that when in \nthis mood, I get nothing though the box, until I reconnect with the cosmic, \nI guess you&#39;d call it, so energy is important. If I continue that reasoning, \nif everyone&#39;s energy is different, than maybe the box output, or any \nmethod,. will also be as diferent? Yeah, cranky, and slow!\n\nAnyway, absolutely no more arguements.\n\n\nFrank-S\n\n\n&gt;From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Apologies in order?\n&gt;Date: Fri, 27 Jul 2007 23:01:24 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s ok Frank we all know its a touchy subject for you right now. I think \n&gt;you are right they are all good researchers and they mean well. We all take \n&gt;different approaches to the work. We just have to remember we are all on \n&gt;the same team and not let our differences get in the way of our progress \n&gt;together.\n&gt;\n&gt;   I look forward to hearing results from everyone. All methods, boxes, \n&gt;water, music, evpmaker, radio, air, laser, light...bring it on. The more \n&gt;the merrier and perhaps we will connect with what others are posting.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Oh and Frank... if you werent cranky sometimes, then I would wonder what \n&gt;did they do with the real Frank Sumption =)~\n&gt;\n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Hi All;\n&gt;\n&gt;I think I over reacted when I thought maybe Bill Murphy, or Rosemary Guiley\n&gt;were using the boxes inappropriately. For that I apologize.\n&gt;\n&gt;What Rosemary was doing by &quot;imprinting&quot; the boxes was not in itself not\n&gt;incorrect, and may actually help the communcations, after all she has\n&gt;written several books, and is much more knowledgeable than I on things\n&gt;paranormal. Bill seems to be an honest researcher, and he is a likeable guy\n&gt;in person.\n&gt;\n&gt;I apologize to everyone for becoming maybe too sensitive to others ideas\n&gt;about how the boxes should be used.\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________________\n&gt;http://liveearth.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;Moody friends.
