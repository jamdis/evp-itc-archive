I have Craig Telesha's book on technology used by ghost hunters and  found it 
very informative and easy to understand.  He covers a wide range  of 
traditionally-used equipment, from cameras to EMF readers, and has a section  on newer 
technology which includes the ghost boxes.  He acknowledged Frank  Sumption's 
and other researchers boxes and yes, he also provided diagrams  on hacking.  
I also wish he credited Mike and Sum on their combined efforts  regarding the 
hacking of Radio Shack radios, but ultimately feel that it was not  a 
deliberate oversight on Mr. Telesha's part.
 
Have a great Thanksgiving everyone!
