<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Nellie,

That one file &quot;What are you to me?&quot;  A man answers clearly i believe 
says &quot;Nothing&quot;.  That is a real EVP, probably a class A and that did 
not come from the box.  That was spoken directly into your recorder.  
I get them on occasion, i feel that only happens with a grounded 
spirit in a location and is confused by the box....Maybe (I don&#x27;t 
Know)  It sounds somewhat logical though.

Anyway, Great Files and welcome to the group !!!

-Steve H.

&gt; Hi!  My name is Nellie and I am a new convert to ITC work.  I&#x27;ve 
been
&gt; doing evps for a few years with a fair amount of success.  One of 
the
&gt; things I have been experimenting with is using music.  I play music
&gt; from the lifetimes of the spirits I&#x27;m trying to communicate with to
&gt; get the spirits intrigued enough to talk more.  I took a quick look 
at
&gt; some of the old messages here, and will definitely have to 
experiment
&gt; with some of the suggestions you all have had about using music as
&gt; more of a carrier wave to make it easier for them to speak through.
&gt; 
&gt; What drew me to this group, though, is that I just made a Radio 
Shack
&gt; hack a couple of days ago and have been completely stunned by the
&gt; results.  I&#x27;m getting more communications through it in 15 minutes
&gt; than I would usually get in evps over hours.  I am absolutely blown
&gt; away.  Even more interesting is that a spirit in my house who I&#x27;ve
&gt; never been able to get evps from is quite the chatterbox through the
&gt; hack.  I have a couple of my first files in the folder Nellie&#x27;s 
Files
&gt; that I found particularly interesting.

&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I am looking forward to learning from/with you all.
