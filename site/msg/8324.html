<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, i help you.  I didn&#x27;t hear &quot;check it out&quot;.  I&#x27;m having a great 
time with this program, it&#x27;s quite amazing actually.  You and Frank 
are definitely on to something with these methods, so what&#x27;s next?  
Is there an EVP Maker part 2 in the works with echo?

&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; I listened to your files and was able to hear most of them. Just one
&gt; comment: In the file &quot;yes--to_help_you.mp3&quot;, after your 
question &quot;Are
&gt; you able to use EVPmaker throgh this&quot;, I can hear: &quot;Yes, I help ... 
I
&gt; help you, check it out&quot;.

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve personally never had succes until today with EvpMaker.  It 
seems 
&gt; &gt; like they&#x27;re talking loud and clear with that audio clip Stefan 
&gt; &gt; posted.  I am going to do another couple minute session later and 
see 
&gt; &gt; what i get, the answers i feel are pretty clear.  But, i would 
like to 
&gt; &gt; know if others are hearing them.  I suggest for people to 
experiment 
&gt; &gt; with this file through EvpMaker and see what you guys get.  I&#x27;m 
excited 
&gt; &gt; once again about the communication we are receiving.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanx Stefan,
