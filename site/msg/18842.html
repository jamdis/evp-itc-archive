Agreed.

&gt;  I know ther are real scientists out there that would probably study this
&gt; stuff if it weren&#x27;t for being ridiculed by the dumb ones. Unfortunate that
&gt; there are people that have put themselves in positions of authority, such as
&gt; the Bulters, that claim they had a team of &quot;more qualified listeners&quot; test
&gt; the boxes and they found nothing to it. Never asking me anything about the
&gt; box, or the theory behind it. Always these experts that know better.  Some
&gt; of these people have $$ interest in keep real knowledge hidden.

&gt; &gt; Yes, you&#x27;re right, what are the chances... bazillion to one is right...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Scientists have a bias against religion because they equate it with blind
&gt; &gt; faith and superstition, some of them perhaps even have a vendetta against
&gt; &gt; their family religion, for making them grow up with a belief system that
&gt; &gt; they feel is constrictive, and as scientist adults their emotional reaction
&gt; &gt; is to do whatever is in their power to bash down anything that might point
&gt; &gt; to a higher power or anything that transcends the five senses... as if a
&gt; &gt; higher power and religion are synonymous (which they most certainly are not,
&gt; &gt; if you ask me)... the truth is hardly ever black or white... the scientific
&gt; &gt; bias and the religious bias.... neither one alone will ever arrive at the
&gt; &gt; truth... the truth is somewhere in the middle...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can also understand your sentiment in which you want to say &quot;screw
&gt; &gt; science&quot;, as you did below :), and it is that same frustration/resentment
&gt; &gt; that some scientists have toward religion when they say &quot;screw religion&quot; and
&gt; &gt; reject EVP recordings. However, if you reject the scientific method, then
&gt; &gt; you reject the other half of the truth, just like those scientists are
&gt; &gt; doing. The truth must meet in the middle.
&gt; &gt; I too feel frustrated at how scientists manipulate the scientific method to
&gt; &gt; arrive at the most &quot;convenient&quot; scientific results - often outright lies,
&gt; &gt; probably, to be quite blunt. Science is rife with corruption, as is just
&gt; &gt; about every area of human endeavor where someone has something to personally
&gt; &gt; gain. However, the concept of empirical science itself, when not tainted by
&gt; &gt; the human elements, works to ultimately prove or disprove the given tested
&gt; &gt; theories, in a more or less logical and objective manner. The scientific
&gt; &gt; method does have its inherent limitations, but still I feel that the evp
&gt; &gt; area of research could have a lot to gain if some &quot;community standards&quot;
&gt; &gt; could be adopted, in order to advance this area of research on common
&gt; &gt; grounds, with a common language, where results could be compared, and apples
&gt; &gt; could be compared to apples. Although none of us personally need this to
&gt; &gt; prove anything to ourselves - because we already know the communication is
&gt; &gt; real and this conviction and certainty is what drives you on further - to
&gt; &gt; develop and adopt some sort of common scientific language, with which to
&gt; &gt; discuss results, I think would help to lend a lot more credence to all of
&gt; &gt; this.
&gt; &gt; I say this because it looks like such a shame to me that all of the
&gt; &gt; incredible work of you, Steve and all these other people I&#x27;m reading about
&gt; &gt; and talking to online, is so easily ignored, when with the right approach
&gt; &gt; and presentation, it seems to me that these results would be so convincing,
&gt; &gt; that they would not only draw the incredible attention they deserve, but
&gt; &gt; would also be nearly impossible to debunk. The question of whether or not
&gt; &gt; intelligent communication is occuring through these devices ought to be
&gt; &gt; impossible to debunk, this is my gut feeling from my limited experience with
&gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know maybe this is just the naive talk of a novice enthusiast, but
&gt; &gt; this is how I feel.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What&#x27;s the chance of a personality coming through that I have gotten
&gt; &gt; often,
&gt; &gt; &gt; while I&#x27;m doing a test video. &#x27;bout a bazillion to one? How many times do
&gt; &gt; &gt; they call me &quot;Purple&quot;, just about everytime I turn one of these on.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Then, what about other methods, what&#x27;s the chance of the boxes mentioned
&gt; &gt; &gt; while flipping between channels pairs on cable TV? At 10-11 seconds on
&gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; video &quot;Your boxes---you hear us&quot;. It&#x27;s not just &quot;a box&quot; thing, it&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; that provides bits of speech, and/or sound frequencies. Recording seems
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; allow manipulation of the sound bits, as if it&#x27;s done in the air, between
&gt; &gt; &gt; source and recorder/ear---but you can also get the same thing with no
&gt; &gt; &gt; external sound, recording from a line output on the box/radio. This
&gt; &gt; subject
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be extrememly complicated, with many variables.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I go by results, screw science, mostly they want what is in the text
&gt; &gt; book,
&gt; &gt; &gt; or you have to be a PH.D to think of something new. Certain subjects are
&gt; &gt; &gt; strictly taboo, like anything spirit/God. We&#x27;ve gone round and round
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the so called skeptics here, they accept no evidence, can&#x27;t test
&gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff, cuz there maybe a chance of it being real, so they just call us
&gt; &gt; all
&gt; &gt; &gt; names--real scientific! I mean the mind numbing mental gymnastics these
&gt; &gt; &gt; dorks do to try explain why there is no conciousness in the universe is
&gt; &gt; &gt; appalling. Thought experiment by ph.d, that makes it fact!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are supposed paranormal researchers and sites that claim the boxes
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#x27;t work, they&#x27;re just veiled skeptics, a skpetic in this case being a
&gt; &gt; &gt; non-believer that can not be convinced no matter what the evidence.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Most important is that users learn life is forever, there are multiple
&gt; &gt; &gt; levels, and tell others. That&#x27;s all it&#x27;s for. I don&#x27;t think we are
&gt; &gt; supposed
&gt; &gt; &gt; to get the absolute proof, there&#x27;s that faith thing--or making one reach
&gt; &gt; &gt; outside themselves.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Try leaving out the &quot;haunted location&quot;, yeah scary but record at home.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Entites are everywhere, and you may get more repeatble results.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the general success rate in receiving intelligent word
&gt; &gt; exchanges
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; between the operators and the radio? What percent of the time? And what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; percentage is considered &quot;better than coincidence&quot;? I know that in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; statistics, better than 50% is considered better than mere chance, but
&gt; &gt; there
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is nobody that would disagree that even 25% success rate would be
&gt; &gt; considered
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;better than coincidence&quot; in the case of using a ghost box. The reason
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I ask is because as I&#x27;m really getting into ghost boxes in the last few
&gt; &gt; days
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I notice that various articles, like the wiki article on evp sound a
&gt; &gt; bit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; skeptical, yet my first and so far only ghost box session was
&gt; &gt; significantly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; successful. I left 100% convinced. Does the fact that a person who
&gt; &gt; claims to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be psychic was its operator, make a difference in success rate?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was really psyched after leaving the session, which was done at a
&gt; &gt; haunted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; covered bridge at night, where I also felt what is said to be a ghost
&gt; &gt; (the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; air feels electrified).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone in the ghost box operating community ever tried to conduct
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; systematic, videotaped scientifically rigorous repetitions of the
&gt; &gt; sessions?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If the kind of success I experienced that night could happen again and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again, why are people so skeptical? Incredible as it sounds, it&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; occurring.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And just because we can&#x27;t explain why, doesn&#x27;t mean its not happening.
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have the whole session recorded and would like to post up some of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; snippets (just want to get permission from my local hunting group to
&gt; &gt; make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sure its ok), because they are - contrary to claims made in various
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; skeptical articles - NOT, I repeat, NOT just words that people are
&gt; &gt; trying to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; construct with their minds out of mere noise, they are in fact clearly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spoken words coming out of the radio.... at just the right times...
&gt; &gt; again
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and again... I would say that categorically rules out the possibility
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coincidence...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So any info on anyone trying to systematically prove this phenomenon by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scientific method? Or has no one tried yet?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
