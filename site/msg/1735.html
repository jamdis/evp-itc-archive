<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I never paid much attention as to which boxes produced more negatives, but I 
used to get alot when I first started this stuff. I tend to ignore those, 
and sometimes if it&#x27;s in a segment I copy to the computer I&#x27;ll play it 
backward. Reversed, sometimes the evil voices are angelic.  That&#x27;s curious 
about it shutting off aplliances, I thought those ran on internal batteries. 
Maybe you&#x27;re getting a lesson in energies?

I did get a quake warning in last nights test, it said  China suffers a 
quake, followed by August 11. I usually don&#x27;t get dates, or locations, so I 
guess wait any see, of maybe they can evacuate China? Often, when a quake is 
coming I get a wolf image, well there&#x27;s a wolf face on the shower window, 
kind of a medium size wolf, so I think if there is a quake it won&#x27;t be real 
severe, maybe like a 6 or 7. Wolves for quakes, cats for wind, and bears for 
tsunamis, which I didn&#x27;t know ahead of time. For Katrina I had a cat(image) 
with huge round eyes.

&gt;
&gt;Does anybody think it&#x27;s possible to get 2 extreme opposites in
&gt;communication?  1 Box curses at me constantly and tells me to die and
&gt;also talks about the end of the world and hell.  And the other one
&gt;talks about how pretty it is there and i always get &quot;Hi&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m
&gt;Here&quot; as well as &quot;Don&#x27;t leave&quot; when i&#x27;m signing off and an
&gt;occasional &quot;Goodbye&quot;.  Has anyone experienced anything like this
&gt;before?  The 1 box even shuts off appliances in my house when i use
&gt;it, i guess i&#x27;ll stop using that one for now until i figure out a
&gt;solution to what&#x27;s going on.  Any ideas?????
&gt;
