<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>bhali,
I&#x27;m not sure which poster you are so I used the name associated with the folder--(Bruce?)

I listened to the new Frank&#x27;s box 12 files that you posted.  It&#x27;s funny--I heard parts of the 
first few messages, but just syllabic cadences in other parts right up until the Lisa messages-
-I heard everything from then on.  

It did confirm to me that I may need headphones to listen to many evps though.  I get better 
results with my ear nearly glued to my computer speaker!  It must look very funny to my kids 
as I listen.... I have some eardrum damage from childhood infections and I&#x27;m not sure how 
much that affects what I hear.  I wonder how much of what I don&#x27;t hear is inexperience and 
an untrained ear and how much can be attributed to the physical damage to my eardrums.

Julie (around but mostly lurking as I&#x27;ve little actual experience with evp and am kinda shy 
about posting)</pre>
