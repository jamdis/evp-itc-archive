<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, Thanks for the extra instructions, it doesn&#x27;t sound too  
difficult for me so I&#x27;ll give it a shot.

By the way, I did listen to your tone control clip. Since I&#x27;m new to  
this my comments are probably not &quot;worth&quot; much at this point. I  
thought the entire clip itself was a lot smoother and clearer than  
most I&#x27;ve heard so far from various sources (the mixed station sounds  
are in smaller pieces so for someone like me it would be easier to  
pick out the EVPs as opposed to entire words from radio announcers).  
The short piece about 2/3 of the way through, where I&#x27;m guessing you  
used a clarifier, sounded muffled to me, which makes me think it would  
also muffle the EVPs. Definitely easier on the ears but for someone  
inexperienced (and I seem to be the only one here!) it seems it would  
be harder to pick out the real words too.

By the way, in listening to the deluge of clips uploaded last night, I  
can&#x27;t help but notice that the voices are all men. Just curious -- is  
that always the case?
