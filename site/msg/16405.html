<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Do you blame Horace Smith and Daniel Wesson for what other people 
do with their fine weapons?

How about Henry Ford?  Is a drunk driving accident with fatalities 
the fault of the driver, or should Henry share responsibility?

&gt; It don&#x27;t make it right Frank and you know that.  Ultimately it is your name.  As I said I am very much a skeptic, but I am a nice one.  When this jackass pulls something and gets in trouble, it will come back on you.  After all, it is a &quot;Frank&#x27;s Box&quot;  
&gt; 
&gt; The fact that there are others out there ripping people off dose not change the face he is doing so in your name, and apparently with your approval.
&gt; 
&gt; I would seriously think about removing yourself from such things and people.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, don&#x27;t want to be a downer LOL  But what I am telling you is the truth.

&gt;  Okay, granted, he charges excessively. So do these mediums. Other than that, I often hear what he hears from the boxes. I don&#x27;t know enough about what Moon does to make judgement. He&#x27;s not the only one making a living off the so called paranormal.

&gt; &gt;You got to ask?

&gt; &gt;The man is ripping people off!  And don&#x27;t give me any free market crap.  He is bilking people out of hard earned money, and in your name with your product.  Yet you don&#x27;t have a problem with that?  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Frank I am going to be honest with you, I just don&#x27;t buy into any of this stuff, but I think you are a stand up honest guy, or you have always seemed to be so.  I respect you for that.

&gt; &gt;Okay, I have to ask, what&#x27;s the problem with Moon? He seems like a nice guy in person.

&gt; &gt;&gt;You were a part of the people that were here to see it when it really went down.  And you didn&#x27;t milk or bilk the rest out of some crazy insane scheme about it :-D
