  File        : /LC&#x27;s FM Spirit Box Prototype/captain_babcock_SPIRIT_OF_BABCOCK.wav 
  Uploaded by : lcdupla &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; 
  Description : This was recorded in the upstairs bedroom where I believe Mrs. Babcock stayed with her cats. Her husband Captain Babcock was lightkeeper from 1871-1881; then again in 1900-1919. His son also was an assistant keeper from 1901-1919; then keeper from 1919-1925. First question, &quot;Is there a Captain Babcock here?&quot; Then a weird-sounding reply which sounds like &quot;Babcock&quot; (sort of). Then another question is asked, &quot;Is there any ghosts around here?&quot; and the reply, &quot;Spirit of Babcock.&quot;
