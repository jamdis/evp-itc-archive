Hi Ron,
 
The best results came from mode 3.  read my review of it on 
_www.paranormalpython.com_ (http://www.paranormalpython.com)  and it will  explain it all.

Which mode are you using for those results 1, 2 or  3.  I get nothing in 
Alpha mode 1 or the mix mode 3.   ron

Hi Zack,
 
Read my review of the Ovilus 1.  The common mistake is that  everyone turns 
it on and expects to get immediate results.  Well  all that comes out is random 
names and what some people may term  "garbage" at that time.  You have to let 
the spirits around  you learn how to communicate thru the box and this can 
take a good 30  to 60 minutes.  At that time all the randomness will have died  
down and you can now start to communicate thru the Ovilus 1.  If  this step is 
overlooked then you just sit there staring at this unit  thinking you just 
pissed away $200.00.  And that is not the  case.  It takes time for the spirits 
to learn how to communicate  regardless of what device is used.  Now if you 
use this device in  the same location over and over again you only have to do it 
 once.  When I first got mine it was spewing out all kind of  random garbage 
that made sense.  But once I did this the  communication flowed fluently.  It 
even gave me the name of the  little girl who's spirit inhabits our house and 
when I called her name  after hearing it this little girl came and stood in 
the hallway  looking at me in amazement.  The best was when my cat jumped up  by 
me and the Ovilus 1 and wanted attention the Ovilus 1 said "good  cat".  Then 
when my dog ran into the room and wanted my attention  over the cat the unit 
said "bad dog", LOL.  So it does work and  ask around to people who have them 
about their experiences.
 
Jeff

Hi Jeff,

Interesting. As I said, I haven't used one  yet.

I just have a lot of suspicion about devices that  generate phonemes as 
opposed to actual sounds received. I'm sure  some spirits can make them 
produce messages but they could also  produce something out of random 
sounds. That's what I'd be  worried about. Might sort of come out like 
James Joyce's  Ulysses.
:-)
