Sorry, but since the ridicule of last night, all I am  going to send for 
n=
ow on are raw files, without conversations in them.   People get up in arms=
 
when they don't understand the possibilities  I  guess.  It's so ironic w=
hen 
a few got upset last year about someone making  money off a box and ch=
arging 
the public, because this person knew or could  hear what spirit wer=
e 
saying, and they could not so they had a fit.  And  this year same perso=
n is now 
better in their eyes.  And here I  am referring many of my own ct=
's. to join 
these 3 lists, and risking  my own validity as a  spiritualist=
 psychic, just 
because I  am able to understand what a few cannot, and  pr=
etty much the 
same  people,  are  up  in arms all over again.  I am not go=
ing to  refer any 
more of my ct's  to join these lists anymore because of =
 last nights 
ridicule.  It made me feel terrible. sf
