Where I\nheard &quot;Kiera we don&#39;t think we&#39;re the same&quot; last night, now &quot;an elk\nthought-what is this shame&quot;, still hear the things about signs at the end.\nTry to argue the cases for these voices and I can&#39;t even nail the damn\nthings down.  I can hear some elements of what I heard last night. Hearing\nisn&#39;t absolute, it changes day to day.  I think you have to go back over the\nrecordings, more than once or twice. When I do a session, I might spend a\nmonth listening before I do another session ( as opposed to these short\nvideo tests).\n\n Frnak-S\n\n@ 2 seconds \"F ank-shu up and pack\".
