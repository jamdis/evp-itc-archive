  April,

  Yes, I agree with you on this. Espec=

  Yes - that is why you HAVE to remain unbiased, which is difficult, bu=

     That's one reason why I've always said to watch out for your o=

The reason is simple. It is quite possible for internal and/or external inf=

 Simply knowing facts is not sufficient. Especially in cases where PK may b=
e in play (such as the Ouija example) a remote PK agent could be influencin=
g the planchette. Before ruling this out, consider that the very notion tha=
t anyone is moving anything is problematic for many people. And spirit comm=
unication pushes the edge of the belief envelope for others. In the end, al=
l of this is some form of anomalous phenomena. You could know things of whi=
ch you are unaware. Consider that you might be clairvoyant and not even rea=
lize it. If you were to externalize this through a latent PK mechanism, bin=
go, you are the agent and the source of information. Yet to all appearances=
 the information came from elsewhere and you therefore presume it must be e=
xternal to yourself, which in this example would not be true..



      I w=
as taking advantage of the physical nature of the experiment I proposed. Un=
fortunately this is what is required if one wishes to remove reliance on be=
lief systems alone. This is what many in the field are looking for. From my=
 own work with mediums and other sensitives, I have learned the perils and =
the potential pitfalls with our own perceptual systems, memories and recall=
. All of this works against us in even the most trivial experimental set up=
, which is unfortunate but true. This is yet one more reason to exercise ca=
ution with solely anecdotal experimental outcomes. You will find that indep=
endent historical validation is actualy pretty tricky, as I have said befor=
e, because it often is not simply factual in nature. It tends to be more ab=
out emotions and feelings and that's where specifically identifying an indi=
vidual gets dicey.



      I wish you all the best in your efforts, whatev=
er path you may chose.
