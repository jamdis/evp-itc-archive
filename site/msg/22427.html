Without a doubt he's always been one of a kind. A unique man with a purpose that often he himself questioned. Frank started this group and placed me in charge because he said he thought he may get angry and delete the whole thing. There are many insights and gifts here not only from him and Debbie but many others who have passed by. I have respect for the groups past and future. I enjoyed the time spent learning and growing with Frank even if it wasn't always publicly shared. Make use of today to enjoy life because tomorrow doesn't exist Misty
