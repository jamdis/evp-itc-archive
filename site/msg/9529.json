I was 17. She was 15. She had had her second ki=\r\ndney transplant a few months earlier and died of gas gangrene.\n\n  She died =\r\nat 3:15 PM and I felt it. I knew that she had died. It is very difficult to=\r\n explain, but I knew that she was gone. So, it wasn&#39;t surprising to me when=\r\n I got home from school and my eldest sister was on the phone telling my Mo=\r\nther that Rena had died.\n\n  My Mother had moved us to Texas from Oklahoma a=\r\n few months earlier. I knew that Rena wasn&#39;t doing good as she was before I=\r\n left, but no one expected her to die. She made a turn for the worse late t=\r\nhat morning and by 3:15 she was gone. \n\n  Late that afternoon I took the Gr=\r\neyhound bus back to my hometown in Oklahoma. When I got to my sisters house=\r\n, it was around 1 am. My sister is 18 years older than me, so I have a niec=\r\ne that is a year younger than me. My niece and I both heard Rena call my na=\r\nme and I then heard her call my name again a little later before I went to =\r\nbed. That night after I had gone to sleep, it woke me up as I felt someone =\r\nsit on the side of my bed. I knew it was Rena telling me she was okay, but =\r\nthis was before I knew anything about the paranormal, so I was a bit scared=\r\n to open my eyes and see her. \n\n  She was my first love and I am hoping tha=\r\nt I will hear from her someday via EVP/ITC.\n\n  I consider myself very bless=\r\ned to of heard her call my name and sit beside me to let me know she was ok=\r\nay. \n\n  Wishing everyone a wonderful weekend.\n\n  Jeremy \n  New York, New Yo=\r\nrk \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTir=\r\ned of spam?
