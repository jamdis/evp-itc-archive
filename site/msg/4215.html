<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well according to what I read below, it sounds to me that Frank is
saying that the mini-box and the RS hack are the same, because it
provides the raw audio that is needed. Also, he&#x27;s saying you need a
little bit of noise or you could lose some voices. The mini-box might
work, but if it&#x27;s cleaner maybe it&#x27;s losing some of the voices.
Interesting maybe a redesign of the mini-box is in order?

&gt;  Well, I suppose it&#x27;s true they wanted me to endorse the Mini box. I
did, because it works. As do the Radio Shack hacks. It&#x27;s all the same,
to provide the raw audio. Not only that, it was alrady rehearsed on
the etheric level, it was like reading a script on my part. I already
knew all the players before meeting them in the physical--that was
just the formalities. 
&gt;  
&gt;  As far as cleaner, that&#x27;s not necessarily a good thing. I added a
filter chip in a couple of my boxes, the LM1894(?!), that put out
perfectly clean audio, it also took out over half the voices. Moon is
correct in that respect, you need some of the white noise cuz &quot;they&quot;
do use that with some of the voices to form words.  AM is noisy
anyway, and that changes with the seasons, years, and sun spot acitivity. 
&gt;  
&gt;  You could get the cleanest possible signal by having your tuning
jump to the center of each boardcast carrier to avoid all the skirt
noise, and in between station noise. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Then, there&#x27;s still the untapped raw audio of HD radio!!! Hundreds
of clean digital broadcasts--the concept staggers the imagination!
It&#x27;s only a matter of time before they start doing like TV, they are
going to stop all analog broadcasts in the near future, wonder how far
behind radio is?
&gt;  
&gt;  Personally, I prefer analog, but what can ya do if everything is
friggin&#x27; digital?
