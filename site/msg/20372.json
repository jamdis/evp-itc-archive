I used to get &quot;Captain Marshal&quot; of the Alpha ship, mostly on EVPmaker. Until October of 2006, a guy calls into C2C, tells George Norry how he had an ET encounter through his TV, which was turned off, they told him how he was really a Captain on one of the ships, supposedly we all have these dual, or multiple lives, anyway he was Captain of he Alpha ship and his name ----- Marshal! I have not heard his name mentioned since, through the boxes or EVPmaker. Curious that, and it&#39;s these mind numbing convaluted connections in the paranormal of which we are only very vaguely aware. Just the synchronisity to hear this particualr show is mind boggling.\n\n F-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Barbara Copeland &lt;bumblebugz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; had to respond to this , made me chuckle, cause my kids call me Madukes, lol\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com; RTSC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Sun, January 23, 2011 8:57:44 PM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Sound the same to me.
