box too, but I don't remember if it's the wave guide box.

All of the later Boxes are made so the Echo box can be easily replaced, and 
some have front panel jacks to allow the use of other echo boxes. I quite 
putting in those jacks, as most had no understanding of their use, even if I 
explained it.
