<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Ken, I have been fascinated with &quot;remembering the future&quot; for some 
time now. I&#x27;ve read a number of examples but your posted article is one 
of the better ones. It seems to me that the linear path of time makes 
sense for the physical world, truth and using intuition to find it are 
eternal. Intuition is the key, but most people are caught up with the 
need to verify everthing and miss the opportunity to use their own 
feelings to guide decisions. 

Scrying is an easy way bypass the logicical brain processes and tap 
into the vast truth that is not affected by people talking themselves 
out of following their own instincts. Sometimes I approach a Frank&#x27;s 
Box (FB) session with this mindset, sort of like electronic scrying. I 
will hear answers that may be constructed through my own mind power 
matrixing the raw audio. Humans are indeed capable of altering the 
physical world with thought energy (see the EGG project link: 
http://noosphere.princeton.edu/ ) and in the case of a FB session it 
could be this ability that allows a FB to tap into the ether where 
intuition lies and find the truth. The ether contains all the thought 
energy from all time past and present.
