<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Anyone using dc6/dc7(Diamond Cut DC7) software. I have been
experimenting with different filters to listen and record radio
sweep(RS hack 20-125).

I wonder if anyone has found good filters and mods to the filters for
using it real time filtering. The other day I threw together some of
there pre-built filters and got a good session(easier to listen to).
The next session those filters did not seem to work as well. 

Here is a quote from the site below(not the software distributor).

&quot;DC6 is an audio editing program just like the ones we use for EVP
(Audacity, Audition, GoldWave), except it has a neat feature called
&quot;Live Multi-Filter.&quot; With this feature, audio coming into the computer
can be filtered live and the result heard with a short delay of a
second or so. A typical setup for EVP would be a microphone into the
Microphone In jack of the computer with DC6 Live filtering what comes
from the microphone and the output playing on the headphones connected
to the computer&#x27;s Headphone Out.&quot;

For those that have not heard of it, hear is a page explaining on how
to use this piece of software.
