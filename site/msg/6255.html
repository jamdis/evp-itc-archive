 &gt;&gt;It really surprises me how many new and old ITC &quot;researchers&quot; have  
not gone through the old data and recordings. The pioneers of this  
&quot;field&quot; took in tens of thousands of messages and recordings through  
a wide range of media.&lt;&lt;

Yes, they may have done, but how much of that was ever made public?  
Not very much. Even today. I have gone through what has been  
released, about six times over. Mark has let more out than just about  
anyone. The key players, Maggie and Jules, have made very little of  
theirs available indeed. I&#x27;d love to see that change so that we can  
better access what was going on.

At the time INIT was together, I was rather desperately wanting and  
asking for more information. When things began to be made public in  
the United States, it was translated newsletters--again anecdotal--no  
attached files, obviously; photos that looked produced with 1980s  
xerox technology (It *was* the 1980s, after all); a lot of second- 
hand stories and a a few first-hand ones passed from person to person  
via letters and telephone conversations. Later, there was audio from  
researchers like Sarah who let her phone messages from Raudive be  
made public. As I noted, I don&#x27;t have a problem with most of those.  
Obviously, a voice was recorded on an answering machine and can still  
be listened to today. I&#x27;d prefer to think that voice really is  
Raudive, but remember that it was not EVP--it was real phone calls.

When Macy wrote his book about it, Miracles in the Storm, I was  
figuratively, if not literally, the the first person who bought it. I  
thought, &quot;now I am finally going to find out what really happened and  
be awed by the incredible evidence.&quot; Only Mark&#x27;s book offered none of  
that for me. I was just looking at the customer reviews for the book  
on Amazon, because I thought I had written a review of it there at  
the time. I didn&#x27;t, but here is one from someone who pretty much sums  
up what I think about it: &quot;Macy&#x27;s book focuses mainly on the  
personality conflicts that undermined an attempt at high-tech  
communications with the spirit world. His style is readable and  
brisk, his tone sincere and unaffected, but he provides little or no  
evidence that the phenomena he describes are authentic. The main  
researchers he depicts come off more as enthusiastic dilettantes than  
serious scientists. For me, Macy forfeits nearly all credibility when  
he casually declares that the history of the human race can be  
understood by integrating some of the spirit communications with the  
writings of Erich von Daniken (p.140)! Von Daniken, of CHARIOTS OF  
THE GODS fame, is an entirely discredited huckster. If Macy can be  
persuaded by von Daniken&#x27;s pop-culture writings, he will probably  
believe just about anything. There is an unfortunate messianic tone  
pervading the book - the message that a new dawn of humanity is  
coming, courtesy of the spirit communicators and the mortals who  
spread their message. You&#x27;ll probably find MIRACLES IN THE STORM  
enjoyable and easy to read (hence three stars), but it will convince  
no one who isn&#x27;t already a believer.&quot;

I mentioned $cientology wryly, and I should have put in a ;) or  
something--my bad--but I do stand by the similarity in message and  
tone. I&#x27;m not conflating the two, I&#x27;m just pointing out what makes me  
wary, and the sentence, &quot;our progress toward a free, wealthy and sane  
future in which humanity would have stripped off the chains of  
intolerance and cruelty&quot; is especially redolent.

In short, while I do believe that we all need to evolve into more  
loving and spiritual beings, and I have tried all my life to do so  
with a few limited successes, I still find that becoming &quot;better&quot; is  
not tantamount to becoming less critical or buying into every  
messiah&#x27;s momentum. As I&#x27;ve said before, I want to believe, but I  
will not believe only because I want to. And I&#x27;m not even saying that  
the whole INIT thing was a fraud. It wasn&#x27;t. But I do think that  
there are aspects of it that were, or that were highly inflated. And  
we have to be honest about that or we can&#x27;t really be honest about  
what is unshakable in paranormal research.

And this is just my own opinion, and we know what opinions are like,  
and perhaps I am one. But I hope you will humor me and keep me around  
because even one of those has its uses. ;)
