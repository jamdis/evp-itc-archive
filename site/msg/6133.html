<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Actually, I don&#x27;t, fortunately. This is was very clear and attached  
to a direct real-time response from me, so I thought I&#x27;d post it.  
It&#x27;s the first swearing I&#x27;ve had since around my second session. All  
the other swearing posted previously came from that one.

At time I heard this one (and by the way, its slowed by about half),  
I assumed that the voice was talking to me, but it actually comes  
just after what sounds like some kind of ruined attempt at  
communication. I wonder if this is one of the technicians telling  
someone off. The &quot;Let go&quot; part is very interesting. Let go of what?
