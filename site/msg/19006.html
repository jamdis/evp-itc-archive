&gt; I like to happy thing,but doing this for 30+ years I&#x27;ve learned how to get 
&gt; results....Youll pick up friendly responses when being aggressive.Do you have a 
&gt; digital recorder ? 1 that you can download to your PC......$40.00 at Best Buy / 
&gt; radio shack....UsIf your using the box only,u HEED to get a recorder.Use that 
&gt; without the box and see what you get..Did you record anything to hear?????

&gt;   
&gt; wow,that is some story...
&gt; I&#x27;m not sure that I am ready to act like that or that it is even in my nature to 
&gt; act like that... and yes, I know all about how the presence of fear is something 
&gt; that others feed off of, (and especially the lives ones, not just the dead ones, 
&gt; lol) which would make it even more difficult because to say I am not afraid 
&gt; would be a lie... 
&gt; 
&gt; However, if the aggressiveness technique works for you, then it is good to know 
&gt; how to use it. Perhaps it is a good attitude to keep in the back of my mind, for 
&gt; times when/if it feels as if something is trying to be aggressive towards *us.* 
&gt; For defense, rather than offense. Although in your case, it could be described 
&gt; as proactive defense, lol. Owning them before they own you, lol...
&gt; 
&gt; The guy that we did the first ghost box session with says that he gets the best 
&gt; activity from when he projects a happy-go-lucky, relaxed and merry attitude. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I guess use whatever works!

&gt; &gt; 1st off walking into the cem or building I&#x27;ll say I&#x27;m sorry and have respect to 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; those who passed.Then I&#x27;ll ask for the evil spirit who is in charge to show or 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; make their selves known..The provoking gets to the point that I&#x27;ll call the 
&gt; &gt;evil 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; spirits &quot;Pussy fucks that only can harm those who have passed and hurt the 
&gt; &gt; children&quot;..for the facts that we catch childrens evps asking for help...When we 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; got those evps we went in with oils for healing and to keep bad spirits away 
&gt; &gt; bought from a store that was straight from jerusilum,where Jesus was born.As 
&gt; &gt; soon as we got there and called out for the evil prick who hurts the souls of 
&gt; &gt; the kids,we got threating evps,KII was pegging out,along with ice cold spots 
&gt; &gt; while it was in the upper 80&#x27;s.I find in every cem.we go to there seems to be a 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; strong dark presence thats in charge,that wont let spirits roam free.We&#x27;ve 
&gt; &gt;NEVER 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; gotten skunked evp wise....When leaving we always demand nobody pass the gate 
&gt; &gt; &#x27;,no-one is allowed to come with use.We had something follow us as well as our 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; other 2 investigators home.I as well as tme other guy felt sick when 
&gt; &gt; leaving.Sick for 6 hours,I pet our cat and felt fine all of asudden..1/2 hour 
&gt; &gt; later we thought where the cat,we found her lifeless eyes pouring out like 
&gt; &gt; puss.Took care of her and when we woke up all our cabnet doors were open with 
&gt; &gt; lights on.Our fellow investigator called with the same at his home.Their dog 
&gt; &gt; freak out and killed 1 of their cats..We took the oil and placed crosses over 
&gt; &gt; all our doors and commanded that anyting evil leave and be cast out...It 
&gt; &gt; worked,something to be aware of....But that dont stop me from telling them I&#x27;m 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; the new boss here and you do what I say...Stir&#x27;em up.No matter what you hear or 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; see..dont be scared,they feed of it and will attach to that.....
