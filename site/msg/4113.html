 Well, I suppose it's true they wanted me to endorse the Mini box. I did, because it works. As do the Radio Shack hacks. It's all the same, to provide the raw audio. Not only that, it was alrady rehearsed on the etheric level, it was like reading a script on my part. I already knew all the players before meeting them in the physical--that was just the formalities. 
 
 As far as cleaner, that's not necessarily a good thing. I added a filter chip in a couple of my boxes, the LM1894(?!), that put out perfectly clean audio, it also took out over half the voices. Moon is correct in that respect, you need some of the white noise cuz "they" do use that with some of the voices to form words.  AM is noisy anyway, and that changes with the seasons, years, and sun spot acitivity. 
 
 You could get the cleanest possible signal by having your tuning jump to the center of each boardcast carrier to avoid all the skirt noise, and in between station noise. 
 
 Then, there's still the untapped raw audio of HD radio!!! Hundreds of clean digital broadcasts--the concept staggers the imagination! It's only a matter of time before they start doing like TV, they are going to stop all analog broadcasts in the near future, wonder how far behind radio is?
 
 Personally, I prefer analog, but what can ya do if everything is friggin' digital?
