This is AWESOME!!!! 
We did several experiment=
s like this on the Magic Cafe and the  results 
were amazing. However, I wo=
uld request that you contact one  member on the 
board and tell them the re=

it can not be trusted=

I think this can be very exciting and fun too!!!!

Experiment 2

On Friday, 7/16/2=
010 I placed an object on  top of my computer monitor, 
right in front of m=
e, and will leave it  there until noon Denver time on 
Monday, 7/19/2010. T=
his experiment  asks for participants to determine what that 
object is. Va=
gue or  partial answers won't be counted (for example, just 
giving a color=
,  shape, size, what it's made of, etc): we're looking for what it 
is.  An=
swers anyone reveals after noon Monday won't count. Participants  
can use =
their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means they  chose. At 
the e=
nd of the experiment, I will reveal the object, and a  tally of the 
number=
 of correct and/or incorrect answers.

In  order to keep me honest, I have =
taken a picture of the object at the  
start of the experiment and loaded i=
t to the Files section (RJ  folder) of 
this group. The idea with this file=
 is that you can  download it now and 'keep 
it safe' on your computer. The=
n at the end  of the experiment, I will post 
the password so you can revea=
l the  contents of the file. That way, you were 
in control of the original=
  image during the entire test, not me. If you 
can follow the link, it  is=
 here:

And if you do not  care to do=

image there  at the end of =
the experiment anyway.

My monitor is one of the  older box-like SONY CRTs,=
 and says "Trinitron" 
and "Multiscan 200sf"  on the upper front. I have a =
couple monitors stacked in 
my closet  too: they are not the monitors used =

 nothing else on them anyway), and I have sev=

Pleas=

public =
record  and I won't get accused of losing any answers. 

And best of  luck =
to all the participants!
