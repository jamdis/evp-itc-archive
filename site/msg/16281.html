Hi Jill,
Its a coincidence  i've started the evp  mostly out of curiously a=
nd recent exposure to other world lifeforms, books, haunted things etc.,. M=
ore to all this, i'veaccidentlally chose a astrologically signficant day (w=
hen the dragons head - rahu is=A0connected to moon by association or aspect=
) which is good enough for paranormal (especially spirits)  experiments.
Th=
e very first message i was able to deciphered  was perhaps in english"xxxxx=
xxx"  "what do you want ?". This was recorded around 00:20-00:30 am in a cl=
osed roomwith a sound of the wall clock. In the whole recording  i was able=
 to hear the wall clock=A0sound and during the voice the wall clock sound h=
ave disappeared and then resumed again
you can check the file from the link=
 below which has a the voice portion alone
