<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Chris has done more to further the research of Franks Box than 
any other individual. Agree, disagree it doesn&#x27;t matter! That fact is 
when the book is written on the ITC and how it was perfected. Frank 
and Chris will have the first and second chapters dedicated to them. 

No matter what side of this argument you come down on there will 
always be different opinions. ITC Paranormal research may be in vogue 
but the idea&#x27;s certainly are not new. 

However, we now stand at the apex of this ride. The gates are open.
The throttle is stuck, crash or survive we&#x27;re in it till the end. Go
away!, don&#x27;t read, don&#x27;t try,it won&#x27;t matter! This ride has left! Even
jumping off won&#x27;t stop it.

We are now going to see an explosion of new idea&#x27;s. But that&#x27;s what it
takes! People have to take sides, someone has to be right , someone
has to be wrong. Without both sides there&#x27;s no advancement. 
I read &quot;too many posts&quot; I hate fence sitters either you&#x27;re in or
you&#x27;re out . But learn to smile and say thank you.

Here&#x27;s the way it is. You say I&#x27;m wrong OK!.   Thank you very much! 
And I go about my business of doing what I want to do,  there&#x27;s truth
to every side of an argument. Just take what is constructive and file
the rest. Just say Thank You!

PS.
To that individual who wrote me claiming to be from the Catholic Arch
diocesi I doubt very much that the Catholic Church uses hot mail ...
oh it&#x27;s Catholic Archdiocese  LMAO

THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
