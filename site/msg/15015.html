A mi=
stake that a lot of people make is thinking that there are two different ty=
pes of energy at work when it comes to sound waves and electromagnetic wave=
s. The only thing that seperates them is frequency and power. Radio waves a=
re radio waves because they occupy a certain block of the electromagnietic =
spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same spectrum just farther down with mu=
ch longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can penetrate almost anythin=
g because of their wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength the more ways we=
 can shield against them.
=A0
Think of microwaves. These are also a type of=
 radio and telemetry transmitting wave but the waves also have a physical e=
ffect on our environment by causing molecules to speed up, which creates he=
at. A little lower than this is IR or infrared it too can cause physical ob=
jects to heat up but usually it just causes molecules to rotate in place. A=
ll physical things give off IR light. Its a way the total system conserves =
energy by spontaneously emitting IR radiation.

I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave an=
d demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It works off the hete=
rodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another i=
n frequency then if you add or subtract them together you get a beat freque=
ncy or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at =
54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequen=
cy at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference=A0frequency at 9KH=
z, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an exampl=
e, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turnin=
g them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were generated within a =
few inches of the recorder.
=A0
We are able to reproduce this affect in not=
 only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio =
as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio spotli=
ght" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
