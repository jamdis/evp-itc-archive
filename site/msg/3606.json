So I patched that, flipped the board over so I could see which wire the mute was on, it was a blue wire, then miss counted, cut the worng wire again, patched that, then unsoldered the right one. You might make sure none of the pins shorted. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Frank\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: Ticket_to_Heaven@...: Sat, 1 Dec 2007 04:56:46 +0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] OK, Now what? Help!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi All, Well, it took longer than 10 minutes to pull the Mute pin . . . or should I say, after moving it back & forth a bit, it broke off! Oh, well, I got it off! Then after I put it all back together, I turned it on, and on AM (light comes on, but goes off, to see what station number it&#39;s on), but for the most part, it still acts like a digtal AM/FM radio! Am I doing something wrong??? Hmmm? Help! 8-/ =Judy=  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Your smile counts.

I thought all one has to do was remove the Mute pin! Now, you say I&#39;ve got to look at the revese side from where the pin was and cut(!?) or undo (somehow) a wire that that pin connects to?  If I do all this the right way, how does the radio work/sound,then?  I&#39;m confused, at this point. I also can plug in external, but small, speakers rather than use the earbuds.  =Judy= P.S. How can I tell if a pin has shorted??       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."}
