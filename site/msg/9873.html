Good stuff aaron.  Stefan is the expert out of the two of us here but if he gives me specific instructions I will be glad to give it a go.  Ron L

tonight when I get home from work.

LK: The session was probably maybe 10 minutes or so. The program 
didn't type down everything, so I will try to tweak it some more, 
maybe by slowing down EVPMaker. I believe it became clear longer, 
because I slowed it down to 80% or so during the session. I will 
definately trying to adjust it some more and share the results again.

Stefan/Ron L.: That definately does sound like a good idea. I will 
see if I can try that. Maybe when I get home, I will see if I can 
copy and paste the text that is supposed to be read to the group. If 
I can, anybody that can help in synthesizing the allophones to read 
the text, that would be a great help. To do that you have to have 
Adobe Audition correct? Or is there anything else you can use/build?
