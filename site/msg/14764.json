I made a Radio-shak hack with directions from UFOgeek&#39;s videos.  This was our first attepmt with it.  How or where would i upload the wav file for you guys to take a listen.\n\nI am having a hard time getting some of our more skeptical members to buy into the ITC-EVP ghost box stuff.  I am convinced with everything i seen and read about Frank and all his work to what i saw on Youtube etc...\n\nplease respond"}
