As far as me not watching ghost shows on tv, \nit seems by your explanation of how you have been involved in the PI \nfield that you are a lot like those cheesy ghost hunting shows. To \nmake a statement that spirits are not interactive and could care less \nabout us or what we are trying to do, that alone shows you know \nnothing.

And if they did do that to you that sounds \npretty interactive to me.
