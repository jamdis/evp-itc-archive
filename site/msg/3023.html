Bruce,  the boxes aside,  I a=

umerous times held conversations with them via voice recorder and once even=
 one-on-one (it was the experience of a life-time!).  I was Hunting Ghosts =
many, many years before it became a fad,  or cool to do so.  And,  believe =

I =

 delusional about "friends" from the other side affecting some inter-action=
 between a box and the user,  not letting one work,  the box chosing it's o=
wner,  etc., etc., etc.  In the first place Ghosts are Not our Friends!  Th=
at's pure, unadulterated Fantasy.
The Ghosts do not have the where-with-all=
 to accomplish this in the first place, and even if they did they don't giv=

 needs to get real.  Ghosts simply do not re-act to the living in that way,=
 or much of any other way except to allow us to see or hear them and then o=
