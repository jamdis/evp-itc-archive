<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi All;

 After a long absense I&#x27;ve re-joined the group. Probably not too many 
know what happened to cause me to suddenly leave the group, and 
almost all internet/e-mail activities. I got in an e-mail arguement, 
the other person sent all my replies to my boss, who also happened to 
be my e-mail provider, and made me look like somekind of on-line 
predator. I almost got fired, I held on to my job by the skin of 
teeth. Interestingly, I got visions that kept me informed of what was 
going on, and allowed certain spiritual intervention. Anyway, I&#x27;m not 
entirely sure I didn&#x27;t deserve that, as I tend to get somewhat 
argumentative at times. I&#x27;ll try to do better this time. Part of the 
trouble I got into at work was for doing group e-mail wiht a school 
district e-mail account, so now I can only do e-mail from home, and I 
won&#x27;t be able to check in as often as I used to. Because of my 
circuit building, I was able to save the district a chunk of change 
this month, which put me back on the good guy list, and off the 
probation.  

 I have continued the work with my boxes, and I&#x27;m trying to get a 
production model ready. I changed the design, and the first one 
worked, but I had trouble replicating the circuit, to make sure it 
was a good design. I think I have the bugs worked, but still have to 
finish the second board. I have random voltage generator part 
working, which is what I changed. I&#x27;m concerned about the system&#x27;s 
future, as it relies on AM broadcasts. A new format, HD radio, is 
being pushed, and I&#x27;m afraid eventually HD radio will replace 
standard AM radio, as HDTV is doing now, with analog TV broadcasts 
already scheduled to stop. It just means I would have to go to a 
digital system. 

 I was getting some weird voices concerning Christmas, and December 
for some time, but they never mentioned blizzard, or snow storm. I 
think that&#x27;s what the voices were talking about, and I did have one I 
found last night on my most recent tape from maybe a week ago that 
said they&#x27;ll close the airport (Denver International). Incidenally, 
I&#x27;ve tried recording during full moons with no change in the voices, 
but recording during the recent solar flares, and meteor showers 
seems to have resulted in better voices. 

 Besides the ghost stuff, I took up bicycle riding last summer, and 
found I really enjoy it, so do long rides, like 40 miles, weather 
premitting. I made a recumbent bike, and I&#x27;m making one for each of 
the Grandsons.
