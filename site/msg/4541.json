I&#39;d like to ask  \nall of you to send positive thoughts her way, as she was always a  \nvery gracious lady who was more than helpful to many, many people who  \nwere interested in taping. I bought my first equipment from Sarah&#39;s  \nhusband and benefited greatly from her wisdom, always given freely.  \nShe will be remembered as giant in this field.\n\nPlease think of her kindly this Christmas Eve.\n\nAnn"}
