I&#39;ll probably be fairly silent through mid-July, but I had to speak up when this email crossed my desk.\n\nWhile I don&#39;t share Snowfire&#39;s views in most cases, I&#39;ve always enjoyed the links & banter.  The recordings are always interesting... and isn&#39;t that the focus of this group?\n\nI&#39;m not thrilled with ultimatums, as if the group isn&#39;t big enough (or big-hearted enough) to include diverse views, respectfully shared.\n\nMy two cents: Snowfire, please don&#39;t leave!\n\nIn haste,\nFiona\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I mean the stuff below, if you are so bothered by opinion, Billy?  I  will \n&gt; leave, but the stuff in that statement below of yours, is very out of  \n&gt; context, to each is own.  I was merely presenting something I came across  on the \n&gt; You Tube, I don&#39;t even know that person. Take care, sf"}
