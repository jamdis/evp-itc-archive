<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I truly believe that the resonant condition will not allow the success
of mass production of this device. I think we are going to come to the
conclusion that the human component is far more important then the
other components, although they all work together. 
We have all heard others stating their own inability to &quot;make the box
work&quot;. These statements have been followed by claims of fraud and
deception. 
I suppose that I should not concern myself with that. I know that the
device works and I doubt that anything could convince me otherwise.
Yet, I remain concerned. I am concerned for those who have been
successful. Right now, we have few that have been willing and able to
build the device themselves, hence few that have been able to claim
deception. What happens to the credibility of the few when many are
unsuccessful? Should that concern me? I am extremely passionate about
this field, sometimes to a fault I would suppose. 
One brief glance around this community shows the fragile egos at work
all clamoring to move up some invisible ladder via whatever means
possible. There is little support amongst investigators and
researchers. Lines have already been drawn as a result of this device.
I am not confidant in my psychic abilities at all but I feel pretty
sure that there is going to be some major fall out as a result of this
mini-box being sold to whoever wants it. I hate the &quot;wait and see&quot;
approach. I&#x27;m too much of a control freak! LOL

&gt;  A little of my reluctance in manufacturing boxes is I don&#x27;t think
people should tie themselves to a certain technology. You can do the
same thing the box does by hand, and at times I think the manual
method works better. It&#x27;s not the technology that matters, it&#x27;s not
contacting departed loved ones that matters, it&#x27;s not proving a
haunting that matters, it&#x27;s only proving to oneself that life is
forever.  What possible difference does anything else make?

&gt; Oh my gawd, you people.. I love ya all but I wrote at least 4 reply
emails and deleted them as soon as I finished LOL
&gt;  
&gt; Hmm so I will just say
&gt; 1)We are mostly all adults tho some younger folks may have joined.
Lets try and remember that
&gt; 2)Franks box is what it is. The first of many. It is always evolving
and changing and that is how it is presented by Sumption himself. A
free design for any and all who care to build it.
&gt; 3)Working together as a group is important, otherwise why bother
joining here.
&gt;  
&gt; Let me know if I need to give ya 4 its a doozy hehehe
&gt;  
&gt; Really guys and gals, I am mega busy at work so I basically do a run
down thru every post before/after work and sometimes it just has me 
dismayed.
&gt;  
&gt; I know you all are capable of better, and able to work together in a
positive way. Ive seen it many times. Dont worry about what everyone
else thinks, just worry about what YOU think. Dont try and form the
opinion of someone else, instead work on discovering your own. And
research.... well? Get back to it!  and share, you just might make
some connections.
