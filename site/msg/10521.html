<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Things seem to be returning to normal now.  No arguing now to speak of on 
most of the other 60 Yahoogroups I&#x27;m on.  And no earthquakes for several 
days!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ralph here again. Seems every time I come back on to leave a
&gt; message
&gt;&gt;&gt; there&#x27;s some bickering going on. I can&#x27;t leave you people for a
&gt; minute
&gt;&gt;&gt; without some hoopla going on LOL (just Kidding). Well how ya&#x27;ll
&gt; doing ?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There seemed to be something happening all around over the last
&gt; few days
&gt;&gt; or week.  It wasn&#x27;t just here.  I am on 62 Yahoogroups and almost
&gt; all of
&gt;&gt; them broke out in arguing and bickering at the same time. I have
&gt; NEVER
&gt;&gt; seen that happen! And one of my favorite area bands had some
&gt; really
&gt;&gt; bizarre and unpleasant things happen at a show on Saturday night.
&gt; And we
&gt;&gt; had three earthquakes here. Some thought all of these events were
&gt; caused
&gt;&gt; by the full moon.  I dunno, it was still very odd but seems to
&gt; have passed
&gt;&gt; now. Lives are retue=rning to normal.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Fine I hope. I have been busy with my Paranormal Group and
&gt;&gt;&gt; investigations and Gettysburg. I was in Gettysburg over this past
&gt;&gt;&gt; weekend and got an EVP in the Triagular Field that said &quot; Never
&gt; trust
&gt;&gt;&gt; Abe Lincoln &quot; LOL must have been a Rebel soldier. I thought that
&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty cool.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It also could&#x27;ve been a Union soldier who didn&#x27;t like his outcome!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I really want to get the chance to visit Gettysburg.  I am pretty
&gt; sure
&gt;&gt; Batleground, Indiana (the site of the Battle of Tippecanoe in
&gt; 1811) is
&gt;&gt; haunted by some of the former soldiers.  I&#x27;ve been to that one
&gt; many times
&gt;&gt; but never tried to get any EVP there.
