<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is an interesting topic seeing as how most people that
participate here don&#x27;t have the need to &quot;prove&quot; anything to anyone.
This forum (and correct me if I am wrong) is a safe haven for folks to
share their experiences, ideas, and methodology. Most folks here have
already wrestled with trying to make sense of the mechanism involved
with evp or itc communication, and eventually decided the mechanism is
not as important as the message. For the moment, I shall concentrate
on my personal interest, box-based ITC. I will move onto traditional
evp in a moment.

I fully realize that it seems foolish to people like you that folks
such as ourselves would be willing to spend countless hours listening
to broken radios in hope of finding snippets relevant to our
questions. Believe it or not, I have a very analytical mind, and it
bothered me very badly that such a contaminated medium could produce
such good results. My ability to leap beyond logic came when time
after time I received very personal and contextual responses that I
can no longer ignore and deem coincidental. I am sure you will as so
many others have before you brush that off and embark on your personal
quest to educate us &quot;koolaid drinkers&quot; on the concepts of coincidence
and pariedolia (as if no one here had acutally considered the concept
or how it would relate to what we do). I understand that from the
outside looking in, it can almost seem silly, and you probably scoff
at the idea as I used to. I don&#x27;t have a very malleable thought
process, but I can tell you that I received very personal and repeated
messages in the beginning and that the odds of coincidence (while I
must always concede is possible) are very low. I tend to try to apply
as much control to the sessions as possible, asking for my name, what
I am holding, whose room we are in, etc... but in the end,
communication is usually at the mercy of this mysterious phenomenon.

As far as traditional evp goes, I have always thought that the coil
induction idea really is the one that makes the most sense. I don&#x27;t
believe that it is vibrational soundwaves. My ideology there (and I am
not as &quot;educated&quot; as others, so it makes sense to me) is that if an
evp was captured with a center frequency below that of human hearing,
how would it be heard on the recording? If I understand correctly then
the process of recording didn&#x27;t shift the frequency of the sound, then
it should be just as silent on playback as it was during the event.
That for me rules out vibrational soundwaves, so I believe that it is
as you said connected to emf. What makes me wonder with your posting
is why you would think that would invalidate evp? Is it automatically
invalidated because anyone with the electronic knowledge could fake it
with the right equipment? That would automatically call into question
the character of anyone who ever collected an evp, and sounds like a
Randi-esque blanket statement. Well it could be faked so they all are?
Trust me, I am not defending my belief system here, but it would take
irrefutable proof of a natural explanation to steer my view, and
statements like that aren&#x27;t even close.

The problem with proof for a skeptic is almost as bad as the problem
of proof for a believer. We are dealing with a phenomena that resists
every form of scientific study. To some that automatically means that
it is BS. There is often just enough, however, to make most folks
recognize that something is going on, and thus makes disproving it as
frustrating as proving it. Sure you can tell everyone what you think
it isn&#x27;t but in the end it isn&#x27;t anymore relevant as a theory than a
belief.

There is something going on here, and I am quite sure that it has less
to do with the methodology as the intent of the seeker. I realize that
explanation doesn&#x27;t fit the science of a skeptic, but be that as it
may, it is just the way it is. I am fully aware of the contamination
factors you listed in your post, yet I continue to have sessions. I
must always concede that at any time, those factors may be present
during a session. It also drives me nuts that I can&#x27;t figure out the
mechanism involved here. I try to implement as much limited control as
I can when doing a session, but ultimately, these sessions will never
be enough to convince any non-believer. Therefore the sessions are as
personal as the motives of the participant. You will find that most
people have accepted that the mechanism is a mystery, and wish only to
share their results and methods with like-minded people. 

I personally view your posts as attempts to stir the bee&#x27;s nest here,
and even a cursory search of this board will show that most
participants here have the same or very similar ideologies as my own.
Coming here to educate us with posts laced with cynicism make me
question your intentions.

respectfully
Andy

&gt; I have tested all of the devices out there, Ron. I could take reams
of paper
&gt; her to explain what I received. The issue is, with so many things normal
&gt; that it can be, the task is proving what it is. If you haven&#x27;t used RF
&gt; spectrum analyzers, signal tracers, and RF field strength meters to
&gt; eliminate the probable causes, then it doesn&#x27;t matter what claim is
made.
&gt; You can&#x27;t prove it. With Spiricom, for example, the Ghost of 29 MHz
could
&gt; just have easily been a truck on a CB radio, as they cover the same
&gt; bandwidth. Every RF band out there has activity, of the living human
&gt; variety. In fact, most of the bands are choked with traffic. Personally,
&gt; since EVP can be captured without any of this technology, I find it
&gt; difficult to buy into RF being a tool, since we require special
electronics
&gt; to create it and communicate with it. Having also analyzed EMF and EVP
&gt; simultaneously and found them to be related, I have a tougher time
with it.
&gt; We don&#x27;t speak using radio frequencies. It would be common sense to
believe
&gt; if we ream conscious after to death at a pure energy state, we wouldn&#x27;t
&gt; radiate at that frequency either. We would modulate in the audio
spectrum of
&gt; our voice, and that seems to be where all the viable evidence is
leading.
&gt; Thus it makes more sense to me that a real ghost talking device
would use
&gt; the same methodology, such as modulating EMF to the voice. It is
simple to
&gt; do and everyone can afford it, as well as it takes no special
proprietary
&gt; instrumentation to do it. All you need is a mic, an amp and a
speaker. You
&gt; are not only creating sound, but a matching EMF field at the same time.
&gt;  
&gt; People have different motivations, and different beliefs. I have always
&gt; approached it from a scientific aspect, and it has served me well. I
don&#x27;t
&gt; expect anything, instead I wait to be surprised. Objective research
is the
&gt; key. Now if people need to believe in it, that is fine too, but
beliefs are
&gt; different from this is what it does. The truth is it may be possible
that
&gt; this can communicate with something, possibly aliens or
inter-dimensional
&gt; creatures, but we have no way to prove it due to everything else it
can be.
&gt; This is precisely why a handful of researchers and scientists have
started
&gt; looking at this stuff seriously. It is also why I am here. I want to
learn
&gt; as much as I can from the methods, devices and how they are being
used in
&gt; order to duplicate the work in a controlled environment, with equipment
&gt; monitoring the equipment and the users. That my friend, reveals far more
&gt; than you would imagine.
