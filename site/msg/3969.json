They also may not be able to tell us (not necessarily that they don&#39;t know the answer, but maybe because they can&#39;t.  I often wonder that maybe some of their responses could actually effect the course of life.  If in fact they do respond such as a warning of sorts and we actually had the ability to change a situation pursuant to their answers or  we could effect history or the future.\n   \n  Example....Say Bruce get&#39;s a warning regarding a tornado hitting a small town.  The other side gives the name of the town and date or even just a day and number of fatalities.  Bruce happens deliver the message (and lets assume that when he  delivers the message to local authorities they don&#39;t think he&#39;s crazy, lol).  Upon that date sure enough conditions are right thus they send out additional weather spotters on a hunch that maybe there could be some truth to the message Bruce delivered.   Sure enough the tornado hits, warning was sent out in plenty of time and no fatalities.\n   \n  Are we interacting with the way life as to be played out?  I don&#39;t know.  \n   \n  I know this is pretty far fetched but it was only an example.  \n   \n  So to answer the question, I think that there are just some things we are not suppose to know for.  What is everyone else take on this if I may ask?\n\nLance Oliver &lt;orbhunterx@...&gt; wrote:\n          So what&#39;s your gut telling you about that, Juli?\n\nThanks,\nLance\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, juli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am coming to notice also that if you do not address a direct \nquestion, they seem to dance around giving you an answer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote: I&#39;m not so much worried about \nwhether there are other types of entities out there trying to \ncommunicate as I am annoyed if they get in the way of the entities I \nreally want to communicate with.
