I&#39;ve put that &quot;mod&quot; on four boards now, and they all work \nconsistently. These caps are &quot;scavenged&quot; from old hard drives, and other \ncomputer boards. I&#39;ve used up all the values the boards need from my &quot;junk \nbox&quot;. As usual, I had exactly enough of the values I needed. On the last \nproto tyope board I converted, I had to use 68 uf dipped tantalum caps, \nwhich works ok, since all that matters is that the capacitors are large \nenough for the frequecies being amplified, and in this case the frequencies \nare very low, only a couple hz. That&#39;s why if these capacitors are too \nsmall, the amplifier stage won&#39;t pass the low frequecies, almost acting like \na filter. I think it was capacitor leakage that allowed the circuit to work, \n----sometimes. Curiously, they would tend to work in my presence, but not \nwhen someone else used the boxes. I use the op amps in &quot;high impedence \nmode&quot;, which is why these capacitors are used, and I think this \nconfiguration gives the best performance for the white noise amp.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCheck out all that glitters with the MSN Entertainment Guide to the Academy \nAwardsï¿½   http://movies.msn.com/movies/oscars2007/?icid=ncoscartagline2\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_1e04_4721_4570\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;WhiteNoise-RVG-Tantalums.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;WhiteNoise-RVG-Tantalums.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_1e04_4721_4570--"}
