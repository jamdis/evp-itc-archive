As all on this board one way or another would have \ndone anything to get their hands on one of Frank&#39;s boxes or \nsomething equivalent.  So, now it&#39;s your chance to get another \nversion of an already great idea and everyone&#39;s complaining.  Isn&#39;t \nthis the answer to everyone&#39;s problem, it may be pricey but i know \npeople who would have paid more in the past for a similar item.  \nThis board is for research, this is just another idea just like \nJoe&#39;s idea of joe&#39;s box and frank&#39;s &quot;frank&#39;s box&quot;.  If this version \ndoesn&#39;t work, than the idea will kill itself.  But, now people can \nget to see if they are truly meant to work with the other side or \none of the 30 or 80 or whatever the number is up to now.  I think if \nyou don&#39;t like this minibox than don&#39;t buy it, but isn&#39;t anybody \ncurious to see the results people get with it or don&#39;t.  Just my \ntake on it, i think it&#39;s crazy that everyone is getting so upset \nabout another form of communication.  It took me back at first \nbecause i felt this would kill my research, but we don&#39;t know if \nthis even works yet.  These things happen for a reason by stuff out \nof our control.  All we can do is sit back and watch, and who didn&#39;t \nthink someone was going to mass produce this idea eventually \nanyway?  \n\n-Steve H."}
