Hey David, Don't give up, yet.=A0 I just got back to read all the posts, m=
ostly dedicated to you.=A0 I actually had written a few responses after my =
first one to you but was not a able to complete my thoughts so it went onto=
 "draft."=A0 
=A0
I did take time to look at you web site and I am impresse=
d.=A0 You obviously have excellent scientific/engineering credentials to wa=
rrant saying "I want you on my side."=A0 If some of the messages we are rec=
eiving are from other than traditional EVP sources, I want to know about th=
em.=A0 Alien, hoaxer, CIA, MIB,=A0Anunnaki, or whatever.=A0=A0As well, it w=
ould be great to know about=A0frequencies, QM,=A0electromagnetic readings, =
everything and anything that=A0you=A0could add to the data would be terrifi=
c...at some point in time.=A0=A0But, using Remote viewing as an example, wh=
ich you investigated and discussed on your web sit, don't you think the "ap=
plication" of this phenomena (I won't yet elevate it to the term "technolog=
y") is worth=A0serious investigation.=A0=A0Remote viewing was developed=A0d=
ue to the results it got.=A0 It never was, and still has not been investiga=
ted and accepted by the "scientific community."=A0 In other words it has no=
t been subjected=A0standards
 of proof.=A0 Yet it works.=A0 I know this bec=
ause I have proved it to myself.=A0 I know EVP works=A0because I have prove=
d it to myself.
=A0
So, my question is from, let's call it, a "marketing ap=
proach."=A0 That is my back group, when I was in the world of making money =
for a living.=A0=A0=A0My questioning process went something like this:=A0=
=A01) what=A0does it do=A0=A0 2) what benefit does=A0it have to me and othe=
rs=A0=A0=A03) what can I do with it.=A0=A0=A0With this approach we develope=
d cable TV and satellite services....I was selling cable tv and 24 hour new=
s channels when people were asking "why in the world would you need more th=
an=A0three channels ---=A0 abc, nbc and cbs?=A0=A0=A0And,=A0who in the worl=
d would want a 24 hour news channel?=A0 Then I was involved in selling=A0ca=
r navigation systems in the 80's=A0and=A0portable cell phones that weighed =
and were shaped like a brick and sold for $5,000.=A0 What's that got to do =
with EVP-ITC?=A0 It has to do with the people involved EVP-ITC...we are at =
the forefront.=A0=A0 Some of us have touched the other side and know what i=
s there.=A0 We do not need to prove it exists
 to anyone else...although ac=
knowledgment from others at times would be nice and certainly appreciated.=
=A0
=A0
In my first email to you I suggested that you get a radio shack hac=
k and go talk to it.=A0 Maybe you have=A0already=A0done a zillion hours wit=
h one, but I am not aware of any posts you have done.=A0 =A0If possible can=
 you direct me to where I can listen to your actual=A0recordings?=A0 I did =
not find them here or on your web site.=A0 Also, I have a few=A0EVP message=

you will.=A0

of this work.=A0 I=A0know of a number of EVPers who have been working with =
