Hi Steve   Just to jump in with a friendly point of view.  I was really appreciative of you providing the videos on the boxes.  One reason for my excitement is because I wanted to see the new RS 125 that I have ordered.  The other reason was because I want to introduce a techie type friend to this whole phenomena and I thought your presentation would be a good starting point.   After watching your video you satisfied my first interest, but I chose not to refer my friend to the video.   I found the video to be very interesting and I was only a little disappointed that responses to your questions did not come across to my ear.  But I could only imagine how a newbie like my friend would react.  Even though he is a techie, I think he would have wanted to HEAR something from the other side.  I felt that someone who did not previously know about the successful sessions that so many researchers have had here, would have experienced a guy talking to himself or, worse yet, asking
 questions to a radio and then answering himself.  Again, I think someone who takes the time to see such a presentation also wants to see the results.  After all, getting a message from the other end is the purpose of what's being done.  Audience expectations should not be underestimated.   Hope this helps.   Thanks again for the videos.   Ron L

I appreciate the concern, however i have learned from the past 
experience. I was going to go and do a brief background on my 
limited time so far in ITC and box research and maybe turn the 
different devices on for those to hear how each one sounds. I 
probably wasn't going to ask questions due to the halloween event 
when i received no spiritual contacts, but that wasn't a meeting 
either where i could explain what i was doing. I also am going to 
bring the 4 spare hacked 470 radios i have to offer to potential 
future researchers. Nothing is etched in stone yet with me going, i 
have to contact them first and see if that's what they want. I was 
supposed to go in November, but declined because i wasn't ready to 
display yet. Now, there is so many different radios out there that i 
can offer the idea for those who wish to approach this research with 
an open mind.

tonight to put the old antenna back on and the sessions keep getting 
better and better. I dragged Juli and Joel in on what i believed and 
felt was going to be a great box session and here is a file only a 
couple minutes in to our hour long session. This is a bit rough 
sounding, but hearing it live is pretty clear and you can hear me 
respond and than Joel agrees that he heard it too. My sessions are 
pretty incredible since the random mode started working on the FB#27 
and i feel the random is the best thing out there...hands down. I 
have done Sessions on the internet through Skype all week and i feel 
the energy between Juli and I are really bringing them through 
clearly. I only use FB#27 now in random mode and it is the best 
feature on any box, between the white noise, echo and random there is 
no competetion up to this point. The hacks are good, but nothing is 
better than an original frank's box. Our friends on the other side 
told me that they fixed the random mode to go and teach others and i 
am going to a meeting on wednesday to demonstrate the different boxes 
and our friend made a promise to come though if i go....so we will 
see.

Hi Steve   Just to jump in with a friendly point of view.  I was really appreciative of you providing the videos on the boxes.  One reason for my excitement is because I wanted to see the new RS 125 that I have ordered.  The other reason was because I want to introduce a techie type friend to this whole phenomena and I thought your presentation would be a good starting point.   After watching your video you satisfied my first interest, but I chose not to refer my friend to the video.   I found the video to be very interesting and I was only a little disappointed that responses to your questions did not come across to my ear.  But I could only imagine how a newbie like my friend would react.  Even though he is a techie, I think he would have wanted to HEAR something from the other side.  I felt that someone who did not previously know about the successful sessions that so
