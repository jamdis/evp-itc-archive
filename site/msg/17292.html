<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

At this stage, a lot of paranormal research seems to be in the &quot;hmm...&quot; and &quot;what if..?&quot; areas.  I like that.  It keeps things interesting.

Trying to silence those with data and results to share... to me, that seems counterproductive.

Many of my best discoveries were reached by overcoming my own closed-minded approach to the research.  

I&#x27;m new here, so I&#x27;m very dazzled by what Frank is sharing, and the amount of information I&#x27;m seeing in this group&#x27;s Archives.  Also, I&#x27;m a little chagrined that I&#x27;d previously heard so little about the box, and what I had heard... well, it didn&#x27;t encourage me to explore the subject.

But, that&#x27;s my point:  Demanding personal proof and/or trying to silence speculation, data and results... I&#x27;m not seeing an up side to that kind of effort.

Baffled,
Fiona</pre>
