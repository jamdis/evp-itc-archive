Yes, that should work.

I&#x27;m in Urbana, Illinois.

&gt; I&#x27;m hoping I can get some help from Frank S since he lives close to me. If 
&gt; that doesn&#x27;t work out for some reason, I&#x27;d be glad to mail the camera to you 
&gt; if you (you&#x27;re not in New Zealand or something?), pay you for your work and 
&gt; shipping for return. Would that work?

&gt;&gt; Hi Debbie,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; What everyone else has said is correct. OUCH! The pc board is now
&gt;&gt; damaged.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I can&#x27;t quite tell how bad it is from the photo. It might be repairable
&gt;&gt; but probably not with the original connector. That would have to be
&gt;&gt; removed and the wires soldered directly to the board. The board itself
&gt;&gt; would have to be repaired also, by someone who has experience in repairing
&gt;&gt; such things.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I could probably do that, as I worked in electronics repair for over 10
&gt;&gt; years, but I live quite a ways from you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, one of my DIY projects this weekend has been to convert my
&gt;&gt;&gt; husband&#x27;s old Olympus to infrared. We&#x27;re not extremely talented in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; electronics area, but we have fun and seem to muddle by. No guts no
&gt;&gt;&gt; glory, huh?
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, for the most part the operation has been a success. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; photographed every step of the way and taped screws and parts to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; photos so we&#x27;d know how to rebuild everything we took apart, and that
&gt;&gt;&gt; has worked just fine. I located the IR filter, removed it and cut and
&gt;&gt;&gt; replaced it with a piece of glass slide.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; The one problem we ran into is that there were two wires that appeared
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be clipped in place as opposed to being soldered or screwed in like
&gt;&gt;&gt; everything else. When we tried to pry the clips open, instead the
&gt;&gt;&gt; whole thing came off the circuit board. WE HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO PROCEED
&gt;&gt;&gt; FROM HERE. I don&#x27;t know if we can just glue the darn things down and
&gt;&gt;&gt; if so, what type of glue to use, or if we&#x27;re just plain up the creek.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I immediately thought of this group of brainy electronics buffs. I&#x27;m
&gt;&gt;&gt; hoping someone out there can give us some advice, or if you live near
&gt;&gt;&gt; Highlands Ranch, CO, you could help in person &amp; bail us out of this. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; was hoping to take this camera to the St. Augustine Lighthouse at the
&gt;&gt;&gt; end of this coming week.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there any hope? I&#x27;ve posted a photo of an extreme closeup of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; clips (one is pink, the other is ivory) and the damaged board -- I had
&gt;&gt;&gt; to sandwich two photos together to get both in focus at the same time
&gt;&gt;&gt; (that&#x27;s why it looks that way). For an idea of scale, the clips are
&gt;&gt;&gt; both the same size, about 4 mm in width, 4 mm tall, 3 mm deep. Not
&gt;&gt;&gt; easy to handle and even harder to see with these middle age eyes.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Any advice would be GREATLY APPRECIATED!! Deb T.
