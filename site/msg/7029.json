Bu\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  A couple voices from just now testign another car tuner. I have \nveryu few of these, and out of four I had in the junk box, only two \nwork. These are weak, almost like regular EVP. Rigel is one that \ncomes through every once in awhile, not sure if that his name, or \nhome, as sometimes he says &quot;this is your friend from Rigel&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  It&#39;s still looking like the sound chamber is completely un needed, \nand may even hamper the voices. What I get form the Ghostman, and \neven directly from a tuenr module is easier to understand that the \nones through an sound chamber and mic amplifiers. the Gostman in \ndirect mode yields longs, and more coherent voices than the original \nbox, at least compared to what I was getting last night.\n&gt; Tonight I&#39;ll modifiy #32 to get either direct recordings out of the \ntuner, or through the sound chamber so I can compare.  I had one from \n2/5/08 from the Ghostman that said &quot;that Earthquake will occur-------\non the island near Chile (Falklands?).  There was a EQ today off \nBrazil, but no island there.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  DRV=direct radio voice\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Connect and share in new ways with Windows Live.\n&gt; http://www.windowslive.com/share.html?\nocid=TXT_TAGHM_Wave2_sharelife_012008\n&gt;"}
