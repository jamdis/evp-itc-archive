I may have missed this if so. Would be interested to see it. Presume you used the MK484 TRF chip?\nIncidentally, I heard comment a while ago that the Minibox uses the MK484 chip.\nJEFF\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  If all this EVP stuff is imagination, how come I don&#39;t hear squat for ghost\n&gt; voices in the audio from the TRF radios? The audio is loud and clear, and\n&gt; broadcast fragments easily decernable, but few, if any ghost voices. I\n&gt; thought I got some with a single tuner, but with the double tuner--nothin&#39;!\n&gt; \n&gt;  I have to wonder if the down conversion process in the standard radio\n&gt; design is part of the box EVP. In super hetrodyne radios, the original RF\n&gt; signal is converted to a lower fixed frequency, usually 455khz. So just\n&gt; providing the raw audio seems to be only part of the box functions, the\n&gt; other tuned circuits must play a parts--the IF transformers being tuned\n&gt; circuits, plus the antenna, and the oscillator. Somethin&#39; th think about!\n&gt; \n&gt;  I tried an LA1135 chip this morning, same as the car tuners use, and it\n&gt; sounds like a car tuner--so it&#39;s back to the LM3820.\n&gt; \n&gt; F-S\n&gt;"}
