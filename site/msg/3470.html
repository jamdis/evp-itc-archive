<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t think it all means nothing, but some of it does.  They want 
to see how far they can push us until we give up.  Not all have good 
intentions over there, just like on our side.  We also have good and 
bad, but we learn to deal with both.

&gt; I don&#x27;t know, the fact that no one hears the same is frustrating. 
What if it all means nothing!?

&gt; Ok, than i hear it like you do. Isn&#x27;t the idea of posting files to 
get different theories on what is heard? What are we comprehending 
in these or any other files anyway? We are just starting to break 
ground on full sentence answers, so we need to sift through them and 
make sense. That one about the earthquake is a great file, but what 
does it mean??? It doesn&#x27;t make any sense, we have to make sense of 
these files. Whether it be in reverse, enhancing the audio or 
whatever. This is our job as researchers, while they laugh their ass 
off on the other side watching us spend hours on the computer to say 
there is going to be an earthquake somewhere that doesn&#x27;t happen. If 
they say &#x27;Steve likes cupcakes in a tree in east asia&#x27;, that&#x27;s a 
great file and it will be clear. But what would it mean and what 
effect will it have on humanity.Nuff Said&#x27;-Steve H.--- In EVP-

That&#x27;s the problem, get something that is not in human awareness to 
be recognized, heard, and comprehended. It&#x27;s almost impossible. &gt; &gt;
