<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Some members of the Big Circle at the AA-EVP do this. Good idea 
Julie. I seem to get a similar voice in a number of sessions that I 
guess could be considered my counter part. _Bill

&gt; hey,
&gt;  
&gt; what you are suggesting was at one time and sometimes still is 
practiced by evp researchers.
&gt; It is called a combined session and it actually serves to enhance 
communication by supplying
&gt; a collective energy. It is a splendid idea and you should post an 
agenda on the group and give 
&gt; anyone who is interested an opportunity to be involved in the group 
session.
&gt;  
&gt; I have not heard of this method being experimented with as far as 
box research goes
&gt; just with traditional evp.
&gt;  
&gt; And yes your assumption about having guide spirits assigned to us 
as individual researchers
&gt; is very much correct. My techs are Mike &amp; Lisa whom I communicate 
with on a daily basis
&gt; My research friend and partner Steve hultay also has the same two 
spirit guides and or technicians 
&gt; assigned to him. probably because our research always coincides and 
is interwoven with each other
&gt; I guess they decided to save spirit work load and assign the same 
tech&#x27;s to both of us.
&gt;  
&gt; If you decide to organise the group session count me in.

&gt; 
&gt; Guys, I have just be wondering if anyone has tried experimenting 
with running session at the same time in different locations with the 
same boxes?I was curious if in fact even though the frequencies would 
be different depending our your area, if in fact some of the same 
voices would come through to each of you.It was just a thought? In my 
testing sessions I am coming to find out that they certainly know all 
of you, Frank, Bruce, Mike, etc.. for your names seem to be coming 
up. Therefore, I wonder if you all have so called &quot;personal 
assistants&quot; or &quot;tecs&quot; assiged to you or if they are random?
