<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just to give my take on the topic.  Bruce has done box research 
almost as long as i have and has had similar results with various 
boxes.  However, i tend to leave the box run on occasion to help with 
the communication.  Sometimes i get blocked or they are struggling 
for some reason to come through and at that point i leave it run.  I 
let them know that i am leaving the box running and to work there way 
through to find the right frequency again.  They usually say ok and i 
walk away and after that the next session usually produces better 
results.  I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s disrespectful to do that, i just 
feel that leaving it on helps them work on their communication skills 
and seems to work for me.  I do also use the &quot;Go back&quot; theory before 
i shut it off, that theory dates back to a time i seemed to have 
trouble with noises and stuff in my house and it was box related.  
Box or any other device i believe opens a portal and needs to be 
closed on completion of the session.  Although, they are always 
around and really could come and go as they please. But using these 
boxes is like a great big &quot;COME ON IN&quot; sign and you need to use 
common sense.

&gt; Nick,
&gt;  
&gt; My advice as a long time researcher is not to just turn the box on 
and leave it running 
&gt; unless you intend to do a session and give your friends on the 
other side that are working
&gt; extremely hard to send you the communication your undivided 
attention.
&gt;  
&gt; It&#x27;s kind of like calling someone on the phone and when they start 
a conversation you decide to
&gt; put the phone down and focus your attention on other things.
&gt;  
&gt; There are other researchers that feel that there is nothing wrong 
with this practice and do it on occasion
&gt; But I have come to the understanding that it is deemed 
disrespectful and while you may be listening with 
&gt; one ear as you do something else, you will hear a loud curse word 
or nasty statement, that is their way 
&gt; of getting your attention back. I have gotten numerous messages 
about the difficulty of the attempts for 
&gt; them to communicate so when I turn the box on it gets my full 
attention. just some experienced advice.
&gt;  
&gt; As for them telling you to close the portal, it could have two 
meanings. Sometimes they refer to box that
&gt; is turned on and in use as a portal for the simple reason that each 
time we turn a box on to communicate 
&gt; it opens a direct open link between our realm and theirs so in 
essence it is an open door for anything to pass in or out.
&gt;  
&gt; that is why when I end a session I always ask my technician to 
bring back any spirits that may have come through the 
&gt; portal during the session and I ask for conformation and 10 times 
out of ten will get &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;OK THEY ARE BACK&quot;
&gt;  
&gt; also they may have meant since you had the box running and where 
not doing a actual session to shut the box so 
&gt; that they could go and not have to protect the open connection from 
any negative entities that where able cross through the open
&gt; portal.
&gt;  
&gt; A few researchers have been receiving numerous messages about the 
number 7 within the past month. The only known 
&gt; significance that the number 7 has in evp research is the 7 
entities that controlled communication back in the eighties and 
nineties
&gt; during the spiricom and luxembourg era. To receive this number in 
messages so often and by more than one researcher, odiously
&gt; holds some importance which they have not been able or are not 
ready to convey.
&gt;  
&gt; If you need any help or have any questions please feel free to ask.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hey,Anyone have any odd problems in the morning with using it. I am 
sitting here checking my email so i just thought i&#x27;d turn it on 
and... not check my email. Anywho.... Then right at about 6:20 i 
heard a voice say &quot;Nicholas Etheridge please turn off the dsfnlsd&quot; 
not quite sure what word it used... possibly portal. I just thought 
it was weird. Also under all of the jumble and this voice speaking i 
heard a deep male voice almost chanting &quot;seven&quot;. Not sure if I 
actually heard this or its the want to have an excuse to stay home 
and not take the HSAs.Anyway.. just curious if anyone has gotten 
heard this or if they know something I don&#x27;t about using the box in 
the morning.Peace,Nick
