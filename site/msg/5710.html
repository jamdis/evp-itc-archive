<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t know, but I tend to doubt it. I used to get all kinds of 
crap, they even threatened to poison my coffee! I didn&#x27;t quit 
drinking coffee, I just tell them to to bring it. They&#x27;ve always 
turned out to be paper tigers--nothin&#x27; there. It&#x27;s just something 
that doesn&#x27;t want you to wake up.

&gt; You don&#x27;t have to name names.. I remember!  Are they really 
demonic?  Do you know why they have to receive an invitation before 
they can enter?  I won&#x27;t be so blas in the future.

&gt;   &gt; Robin,
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; It&#x27;s never a good idea to invite any spirits into your home.
&gt;   &gt; Some demonic spirits have to be invited in before they can 
&gt;   &gt; enter, there are instinces where people have heard knocks on 
thier
&gt;   &gt; front door only to answer the door and have no one there.
&gt;   &gt; The knocking by an entity and the opening by the physical being 
&gt;   &gt; symbolises the request to come in and the invitation of the 
open 
&gt;   door.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; If you give out a ready made invitation, it could be like that 
&gt;   annoying
&gt;   &gt; relative that comes to visit and never leaves.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; So be very careful whenever summoning any unknown entities.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; If you need help with your box research or have any questions
&gt;   &gt; don&#x27;t hesitate.

&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; Yes Bruce, &quot;We want to kill you&quot; is word for word what I hear. 
&gt;   Thank you for being the first person ever to validate this for 
me, 
&gt;   because now I know it&#x27;s REAL, I&#x27;m not crazy, and it isn&#x27;t my 
&gt;   imagination. This was captured on a digital voice recorder while 
I 
&gt;   was heating coffee in the microwave oven nearby, and I felt that 
the 
&gt;   microwave must have been a powerful energy source for 
the &quot;speaker.&quot; 
&gt;   It may be important to note that I had just invited spirits 
inside 
&gt;   the house from outside, and that after I listened to this message 
I 
&gt;   told them to go back outside because they were too rude to 
continue 
&gt;   talking to. I&#x27;ve tried to replicate this experiment a number of 
&gt;   times since then (without the verbal invitation into my home) and 
&gt;   have had no luck whatsoever. 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; Gleefully moving on to box research!

&gt;   &gt; Robin, In the evp file you posted I believe I&#x27;m hearing &quot;we 
want to 
&gt;   kill you&quot;please let me know if that is what you hear. Robin, I am 
&gt;   glad to hear that the protection ritual will be utilized by you 
in 
&gt;   the purpose it was intended. To give any individual that wants to 
&gt;   anopportunity to use it. You will find many forms of interaction 
on 
&gt;   this group, running the gamut from total agreement to calm 
&gt;   debate /discussion. To full blown arguments. That is what makes a 
&gt;   group, If everyone followed one single ideology and the ideas of 
any 
&gt;   single person without questionit would not be a group it would be 
a 
&gt;   cult. Welcome to the wonderful world of box research robin, I&#x27;m 
sure 
&gt;   you will be a valued member and researcher in this community.

&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; I&#x27;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I 
absolutely 
&gt;   believe in the power of prayer, the power of positivity, and the 
&gt;   power of ritual. When I first started recording EVP a couple of 
&gt;   years ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when it 
&gt;   happened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or 
distressed. I 
&gt;   will ask again: What physical or psychic harm is a disembodied 
&gt;   entity capable of doing? Please listen to the one EVP I&#x27;ve posted 
on 
&gt;   this board and tell me what, if anything, you hear. I know what I 
&gt;   hear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is the 
&gt;   response that has created the determination in me to continue 
&gt;   researching the unknown. 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings. I only want to learn as 
&gt;   much as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on 
this 
&gt;   board. It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in the 
&gt;   past, and that&#x27;s about all I can say. I will probably use one 
from 
&gt;   this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract 
&gt;   goodness. 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; So, thank you for this contribution. I think the debate has 
been 
&gt;   an excellent one, and I&#x27;ve appreciated the opportunity to be 
&gt;   enlightened.
&gt;   &gt;

&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; I swore I would not get wraped up in this debateBUT!The reason 
I 
&gt;   came up with this whole protection ritual was that some of the 
new 
&gt;   researchers whereexpressing a rational concern for negative 
responces 
&gt;   that they were recieving through thier boxes.The short protection 
&gt;   ritual that I posted is not meant to quell irrational histerical 
&gt;   fear, and I agreewith rosemary that anyone suffering from such 
fear 
&gt;   should rethink thier involment in the paranormal research 
field.that 
&gt;   being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal comfort 
to 
&gt;   those new individuals that had never expperienced spiritual 
&gt;   negativity. And to help ease them into aproaching a session 
&gt;   eventually with confidenceand determination as well as full 
&gt;   curiousity for all types of the communication we recieve.My 
initial 
&gt;   post of the ritual file was done with the best of intentions and 
&gt;   meant to be another tool available for those who felt they needed 
or 
&gt;   wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer ritual, I 
don&#x27;t 
&gt;   think it is really worthy of all this debate.Use it, don&#x27;t use 
it. 
&gt;   It&#x27;s there if you want it. Also I must say there are two kinds of 
&gt;   fear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion for self 
&gt;   preservation, ie the fright and flight reflex that is an 
instinctive 
&gt;   trait in all of us. Then you have the irrational dibilitating 
phobic 
&gt;   fear that can turn an individual into a frozen statue. That type 
of 
&gt;   fear I believe is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt with 
and 
&gt;   learned how to harness. I also believe that anyone that harbors 
that 
&gt;   type of fear would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a 
&gt;   case of such fear it would already be present and doing a small 
&gt;   protection ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take it 
for 
&gt;   what it is, something to utilize in our box of tools like an emf 
&gt;   meter.you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the bottom of 
&gt;   your tool box at home that you inherited from your grandfather 
and 
&gt;   have never usedbut if you come across that odd nut that needs 
&gt;   tightening somedsy you will be glad you have it.Bruce
