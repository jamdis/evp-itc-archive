<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I misread that, thought ya said it did kill off the good bugs. 

 I think with that, it&#x27;s time to let the real experts out there take 
over.  I don&#x27;t care, I don&#x27;t sell this stuff, don&#x27;t do shows of 
anykind, and pretty much avoid the spotlight, contrary to these real 
experts. They can nave it!

&gt; Oil of oregano is an antibiotic and antifungal. It does not, 
however, kill 
&gt; off the intestinal bacteria that are so important to your 
digestion. It 
&gt; may help in the elimination of the H. Pylorii bacteria (the cause 
of 
&gt; ulcers).
&gt; 
&gt; It&#x27;s pretty strong stuff, though, and will burn your mouth if taken 
&gt; directly. Put a couple drops in an ounce or two of another oil 
&gt; (recommended: coconut oil) and drink it that way if you can.
&gt; 
&gt; You can probably get it at a local health food store.

&gt; &gt; I have never heard of Oil of Oregano.  What is it used for and 
where can you buy it?
&gt; &gt;  I had some bad chest pains is why I was feeling like shit.

&gt; &gt; effective, such as Oil of Oregano. Heart burn might mean there&#x27;s a
