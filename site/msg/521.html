Subject: PLEASE INFORM EVERYONE 


Emails with pictures of Osama Bin-Laden hanged are being sent and the moment
that you open these Emails your computer will crash and you will not be able
to fix it! If you get an email along the lines of "Osama Bin Laden Captured"
or "Osama Hanged" don't open the attachment. This e-mail is being
distributed through countries around the globe, but mainly in the US and
Israel. Be considerate & send this warning to whomever you know. PLEASE
FORWARD THIS WARNING AMONG FRIENDS, FAMILY AND CONTACTS: You should be alert
during the next days: Do not open any message with an attached filed called 
Invitation" regardless of who sent it. It is a virus that opens an Olympic
Torch which "burns" the whole hard disc C of your computer. This virus will
be received from someone who has your e-mail address in his/her contact list
that is why you should send this e-mail to all your contacts. It is better
to receive this message 25 times than to receive the virus and open it. If
you receive a mail called "invitaton", though sent by a friend, do not open
it and shut down your computer immediately. This is the worst virus
announced by CNN, it has been classified by Microsoft as the most
destructive virus ever. This virus was discovered by McAfee yesterday, and
there is no repair yet for this kind of virus. This virus simply destroys
the Zero Sector of the Hard Disc, where the vital information is kept.
