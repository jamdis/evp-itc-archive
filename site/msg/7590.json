Looks and sounds promising.  \nBut I suppose in my Land-of-Weak-Signals I would get nothing.  On the \nother hand, I almost feel I would sacrafice a volume of sessions and \nsignals for good, clear, multi-word messages.  I am getting EVP block \nbecause I am afraid I will get nothing during a session or, worse \nyet, I may be getting messages but I cannot hear or understand \nthem...if you get my drift.  Good stuff at your end.  Ron L\n&gt; \n&gt; LC Duplatt &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:          I had posted this \nelsewhere, but thought I should post it here for \n&gt; group fodder. The uploaded preceding files were from a new spirit \nbox \n&gt; I am testing that scans to strong signals only on the FM band, with \n&gt; scan rate and range adjustments. This method is different sounding, \n&gt; being somewhat choppy, but may yield clearer audio. The downside, \nas I \n&gt; have been discussing elsewhere, may be the lack of weaker signals \n&gt; between, and less white noise to be utilized. I&#39;ll keep working \nwith \n&gt; it and post my results as I have them. If spirits can manipulate \n&gt; audio, then this method may have merit, too. ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; http://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                          \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
