<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank.  I&#x27;m always in awe of people, such as yourself, who have this amazing 
understanding of electronics!  LOL- I could no more create and build a box than sprout 
wings and fly.  ;-)

&gt;  Another board to test some ideas, like designing the board to fit a store bought 
cabinet, instead of making the board, and trying to come up with a box that it will fit in. 
Then while setting up the RF amp coil, I kept trying to find the signal peak, and kept 
taking off turns. I could tell I was getting close, but the number of turns is almost half 
what I thought it should be, and what I had used in other radios. I must have been doing 
something wrong before, because I finally reached signal peak, or where the coil and the 
tuning diode resonate, at 66 turns of wire. I was using 110 turns on the coils, so the 
radios were not as sensitive as they could be. This one is just kick butt! and small, that&#x27;s a 
9 volt battery for size comparison. Of course this is the radio/audio only board, sweep will 
be on a secondary board. I also wanted to check the radio operation, as I want to turn this 
one into a printed circuit board.
&gt;  
&gt;  BTW, I don&#x27;t calculate the turns on the coils, they&#x27;re from the junk box, so there&#x27;s no 
way to tell the ferrite mix, so you can&#x27;t calculate the number of turns for a certain 
inductance.
