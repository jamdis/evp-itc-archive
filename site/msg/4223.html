<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank! I hope you will take a 2 week vacation from all of this, then reconsider - as there&#x27;s many who DO respect YOU the maker/creator of &quot;Frank&#x27;s Box&quot; and the inspiration for the Mini-Box, Joe&#x27;s Box, and even, to some degree, the RS Hacks! We&#x27;d hate to see you leave and let Chris Moon &quot;win the war&quot; by making you leave, so HE can come on this group, for whatever reasons (remember he&#x27;s a manipulative businessman &amp; you&#x27;re not)! PLEASE STAY ON, HERE! Thank you SOooo much for helping SOooooo many of use, here!  PEACE!  =Judy=                                                                   --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:

&gt;  After a long discussion, and at times a yelling match with Chris Moon on the phone...I have like zero memory for verbal stuff, basically I think it came down to he said-she said type deal. I could agree with some of what Mr Moon said, but the bottom line is--I don&#x27;t care! I have had enough of these endless pissing contests, one person telling me one thing, someone else telling me something else. I&#x27;m not wise enough to tell who is telling the truth. I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;m not discussing this stuff anymore, I&#x27;m not making boxes anymore. I have absolutely no interest in the so called paranormal. I don&#x27;t sell this shit, I don&#x27;t make any money, all it does eat all my time and piss me off. I&#x27;ll finish this last box I&#x27;m working on, and that&#x27;s it. No more e-mails, no more discussion--I have had it!
&gt;  
&gt;  Mr Moon said he would be glad to come on the group and answer question--so there ya go, now is your chance. I&#x27;m not going to be the go between, nor will I participate.
