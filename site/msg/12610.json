Just a quick note to say I&#39;m getting communication via a manual sweep of the ADS \nTech Instant FM hardware and Snaptune One software combo.  There is also Instant Radio \nsoftware included, but so far I can only figure out how to make it emulate an automated \nsweep and I can&#39;t make it go fast enough to be useful.  \n\nJust thought I&#39;d share this info as another viable sweep tool for communication.  I&#39;m playing \nthe sound through the speaker of my PC and recording via the built-in mic of my Mac using \nAudacity.  \n\nCost of the unit, including shipping, is about $25 through BestBuy.com  Wish it had an AM \noption!\n\nHere is a link to the mfr site:\n\nhttp://www.adstech.com/products/RDX-155-EF/intro/RDX-155-EF_intro.asp?pid=RDX-\n155-EF\n\nMargaret"}
