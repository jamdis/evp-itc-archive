ITC in general has been attacked since Jurgenson. When\n&gt; Konstantin Raudive went into the shielded control room of Pye Studios and\n&gt; recorded EVP&#39;s, it still wasn&#39;t good enough for &quot;science.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Fact is, as I alluded to earlier in the post you so graciously &quot;skimmed,&quot;\n&gt; science is not studying this. Real two way communication through frequency\n&gt; sweeping radio has only come to light less than nine years ago.\n&gt;\n&gt; What scientists do you think would study this? What lab would take on the\n&gt; Ghost Boxes as a project? The answer: none. Why? Because there is no way a\n&gt; project like this could get funding. Also, if any reputed lab did study this\n&gt; and found out that there might be something to it, and then published about\n&gt; it, any scientists involved with that lab would be black listed from future\n&gt; projects just do to the incendiary nature of exploring the paranormal.\n&gt;\n&gt; So it is up to independent people to work on this stuff right now, which,\n&gt; as stated earlier, is in its absolute infancy as an ITC device. The fact is\n&gt; that there are many people who use these boxes and if they do it at all\n&gt; seriously, then they get results...some of which are indicative of some\n&gt; intelligence trying to communicate with us.\n&gt;\n&gt; Association Transcommunication (Formerly AA-EVP) has recently embarked upon\n&gt; a study of ghost boxes, but the results are not yet available because they\n&gt; are being examined and the results interpreted. If they post something\n&gt; positive (white papers are always available on their site), would that\n&gt; constitute proof for you? These guys are going to be the closest thing to\n&gt; unbiased research that you will find in the field and their reputation is\n&gt; impeccable.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://atransc.org/journal/radiosweep_study.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; For the rest of us, we do not have labs, nor the equipment to do the\n&gt; rigorous science you call for to find the proof. Most of us have no idea how\n&gt; electronics, physics, or energy waves work. We accept that, we just know\n&gt; that our boxes work. This is the same as turning on a light bulb...we don&#39;t\n&gt; know diddly about how electrons fire or electricity is generated, but I&#39;ll\n&gt; be damned if there isn&#39;t a light while I&#39;m typing this and it works.\n&gt;\n&gt; Would you please answer a two-part question for my own edification?\n&gt;\n&gt; What would you consider proof, and how can evidential proof be presented to\n&gt; you so it will not be in question?\n&gt;\n&gt; And yes, you figured out the big secret: we are a cult.
