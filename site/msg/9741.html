<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just a quick suggestion: Since this is not a private forum and anyone can access what is 
posted here ... it&#x27;s probably best to take this kind of communication off the boards and into 
the privacy of email. Sharing software applications is such a common practice it&#x27;s easy to 
forget (or simply disregard the knowledge) that it is illegal, and people can and do get caught 
and fined for it.  Granted, the odds are slim, but no sense in providing evidence to &#x27;piracy 
police&#x27; when you could just as easily protect yourself by not making communication of this 
nature viewable to everyone.  :-)
