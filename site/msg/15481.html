there are earth quakes everyday, this planet is alive, it's a dynamic  
earth, if there were no earth quakes, it would probably just explode from the  
pressure, so there has to be earth quakes to let off that pressure, and for  
there to be a hurricane in NJ this August , the ocean would need to really 
warm  up big time in the north, with the cold water in the northern Atlantic, 
 hurricanes don't usually like that sort of thing, they like the warmer 
waters  from the southern end mostly, Steve is worried about his  ghost house 
because he is in NJ.

I have gotten some right on the money, predictions I thought "no friggin'

 there's the ever present "earthquake" with no location, date, or time. 
There's  earthquakes everyday.
