EVPmaker provides those bits of speech, and sweeping a radio\nacross it&#39;s tuning range is a convenient source of speech bits. You can also\nuse crown noise, fan noise, running water noise, wind noise--any noise that\nhas sound that the human ear can perceive. You can use a foreign language\nyou don&#39;t understand as the raw audio.\n\n Yeah, radio by itself, as in just a carrier wave would do nothing for\nspirit communication, it&#39;s only when the radio signal is demodulated in a\nreceiver to provide the bits of speech music and noise that it becomes\nuseful in spirit communication. Just one method of many to provide the raw\naudio.\n\n Frank-s\n\n\n\nOn Sat, Jul 10, 2010 at 7:20 AM, John S &lt;phenom_investigator@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Raymond Bayless was getting recorded spirit voices back in the 1950&#39;s.\n&gt;\n&gt; While his best known work was with von Salazy on audio tape, Bayless\n&gt;\n&gt; also received voices using an early grammophone-style recording device.\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, he was using strictly a mechanical recorder. This would\n&gt;\n&gt; suggest that the voices may not require electronics at all. And that would\n&gt;\n&gt; imply that radio signals may have nothing to do with the voice reception.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Consider too that EVPMAKER sessions seem to work well for some people.\n&gt;\n&gt; Except for the mechnical recordings, which are few in number, all the\n&gt;\n&gt; current techniques have electronics in common. So it would make sense\n&gt;\n&gt; that electronics might be important to the process. However, when\n&gt;\n&gt; you factor in the mechanical recordings made using devices prior to\n&gt;\n&gt; modern electronics, it seems more sensible to look for a common\n&gt;\n&gt; explanation which involves environmental manipulation. The most reasonable\n&gt;\n&gt; thing we know of that meets this criterion is mind-matter interaction,\n&gt;\n&gt; or psychokinesis (PK).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The only remaining question then, aside from the actual source of the\n&gt;\n&gt; information which cannot be objectively ascertained as of yet, is whether\n&gt;\n&gt; a single or multiple mechanisms are indeed at work. Even though radio waves\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; are not required to produce the phenomena, if multiple mechanisms are at\n&gt; work,\n&gt;\n&gt; it may be that radio waves are one of many ways the phenomena is produced.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bottom line, with so many options much more information is needed to form\n&gt; any\n&gt;\n&gt; reasonable hypothesis.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nThe only conclusion I ha e so a is ha p o iding a aw ma e ial o he en i ies o o m hei oices om seems o make he communica ion possible.
