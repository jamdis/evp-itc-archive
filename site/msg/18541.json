I don&#39;t know why, but testing doens&#39;t\nseem to work, but we get enough to prove this to ourselves. It&#39;s probably a\nfaith thing, although I&#39;m not religious, even anti-religion.\n\n F-S\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Aug 20, 2010 at 6:27 PM, &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  [Attachment(s)&lt;https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&view=js&name=main,tlist&ver=9oD1J7yvz5o.en.&am=!xONyw1plirqxhZ4a1PIWg1xlTveuJ8oWIzqJ6mz0Dt83ht4Zrp4&fri#12a920b21a6295da_TopText&gt;from\n&gt; SnowfireL@aol.com included below]\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is a short file, where someone says, &quot;Scamp, Scamp,&quot; then Scamp barks.\n&gt; &quot;yap.&quot;  This little dog belonged to my grandma, when I was about 9 or 10\n&gt; years old, he was a Manchester Terrier, and lived with us for many years,\n&gt; and this is his bark for sure.  I&#39;d know that bark anywhere.  Sorry, that I\n&gt; can&#39;t make it any clearer, I need to get one of those better ghost boxes I\n&gt; guess.  RJ, spirits are just like us, they are not omnipresent like\n&gt; God,  probably why David doesn&#39;t want to play the guessing game, he has\n&gt; better things to do over there, and has said, they have thousands of people\n&gt; standing in this long line waiting to get into the Heavens, and He can&#39;t\n&gt; just drop His job and go to your house to see what you have over there, He\n&gt; did tell me that first time what it was, and i sent it to you, but it was\n&gt; too late.  It&#39;s hard for me to understand them sometimes, He was also right\n&gt; about that little boy, Syler being killed, and where his body would be\n&gt; found, I don&#39;t know what they did about it though. sf\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\nI ge ou las dogs om ime o ime, and used o ge hem ia whi e noise when I i s s a ed his.
