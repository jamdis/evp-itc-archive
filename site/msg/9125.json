Sorry for my blasting you. I still \nfeel that taking a loss on a product is not sending \n&gt; any meaningful message to the guy, and would only possibly prevent one sale, for every \n&gt; unit sold at a loss ... but providing a listing at a minimal fee (with no hassles of money \nup \n&gt; front, going to the post office, etc.) would work great. \n&gt; \n&gt; Again, sorry for being Devil&#39;s Advocate. :-( As I posted to Bruce and Jeremy... \nessentially, \n&gt; I am on the same moral page with the rest of you! \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Marlboro63@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Kay,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That was what I posted on my original idea over a week ago and I was blasted \n&gt; &gt; about it especially that I would look like a fool that I was willing to take \n&gt; &gt; a loss of a few bucks.

To list it \n&gt; &gt; it is $1.00 for $25.00-449.00 plus 8.75% of the initial $25.00 \n&gt; &gt; ($2.19), plus 3.50% of the remaining closing value balance ($25.01 \n&gt; &gt; to $1,000.00)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would be willing to list the one I have plus give the information \n&gt; &gt; on the free hacking and that fact that you can get one at Radio \n&gt; &gt; Shack for $24.99 just to shut this guy down. At the most I would be \n&gt; &gt; out $1.00 to not sell it!!!!
