Of course. We&#39;re not stupid... or at\n&gt; &gt; least most of us aren&#39;t. Is ALL of it pareidolia? Not a chance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So let&#39;s get back to what&#39;s interesting: Searching for what the voices are,\n&gt; &gt; how to hear and interpret what they&#39;re saying, and which ones to take\n&gt; &gt; seriously. Let&#39;s find ways to hear them so even the most adamant skeptic\n&gt; &gt; must concede that something interesting is going on here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (Of course, the very fact that they&#39;re still reading this list suggests\n&gt; &gt; that, in their heart of hearts, they do find the voices interesting, and\n&gt; &gt; deeply want to believe.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheerfully,\n&gt; &gt; Fiona\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I took the skeptics off moderation in a mistaken effort to be fair, but\n&gt; &gt; all this does is disrupt the conversation about what these voices are, and\n&gt; &gt; how to hear it and interpret it better.
