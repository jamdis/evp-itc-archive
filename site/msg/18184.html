<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The only way to assure a true test is to actually &quot;TELL&quot; a trusted source
what was done. Perhaps Frank?

&gt;  you know Steve and Frank, maybe he has done some testing, and they have
&gt; told him things similar to what they do for us, like exp. the color shirt he
&gt; is wearing, a pets name, what type of bird it is, exp. &quot;macaw.&quot;  What we
&gt; know is that there is a place of Light, and a place of darkness over there,
&gt; people ask all the time for help to go into the place of light.  Perhaps
&gt; some of them are not allowed to cross just yet, maybe there are goofy&#x27;s over
&gt; there too that enjoy playing pranks, so they will say anything just to keep
&gt; us talking to them, maybe they get lonely esp. when they happen to be
&gt; &quot;stuck&quot; somewhere.  There are so many factors, and they are probably not
&gt; able to see all, otherwise, we would all be rich from winning the lotto by
&gt; now.  Even David claims the thing &quot;is rigged.&quot; sf

&gt;
&gt; I see a point that frank makes. For example, my file was very clear that
&gt; said &quot;marker&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t mean that we are all nuts, that&#x27;s the information
&gt; that was given to us. It was a direct response to a question that i asked.
&gt; It&#x27;s not our fault that they gave me bad info, they probably didn&#x27;t know the
&gt; answer.
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t want to treat them like some retarded idiots over there, i wish to
&gt; give them respect. The fact in my mind is that they are saying something and
&gt; just because they didn&#x27;t get your test right doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s any less
&gt; fascinating to me that something talks that shouldn&#x27;t. They probably could
&gt; care less what&#x27;s on your monitor.
&gt;
&gt; They are probably sitting there trying to figure out why you aren&#x27;t doing
&gt; anything yourself.

&gt; &gt; DAH! again. There&#x27;s way to much expectation created in trying to guess,
&gt; so
&gt; &gt; participants minds interfere with whatever spirit communication there
&gt; might
&gt; &gt; be. You do not understand how this communcations works, nor do you
&gt; &gt; understand the effects of the observer, you can not seperate the observer
&gt; &gt; from the event in the pararnormal. therefore any results are
&gt; invalid--before
&gt; &gt; you go puffing your chest out thinking how clever you are in debunking
&gt; &gt; spirit communication. Even your own expectation that no valid information
&gt; &gt; will be received is enough to block all information. But as usual,

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks to everyone who participated in Experiment 2.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor,
&gt; &gt; &gt; right in front of me, and left it there until noon Denver time on
&gt; Monday,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 7/19/2010. This experiment asked for participants to determine what
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; object was. Vague or partial answers would not be counted (for example,
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; &gt; giving a color, shape, size, what it&#x27;s made of, etc): we&#x27;re looking for
&gt; what
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#x27;t
&gt; count.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other
&gt; means
&gt; &gt; &gt; they chose.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the start
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this
&gt; group.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The idea with this file is that you could download it at the beginning
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the experiment and &#x27;keep it safe&#x27; on your computer. Then at the end of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; experiment, I would post the password so you can reveal the contents of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; file. That way, you were in control of the original image during the
&gt; entire
&gt; &gt; &gt; time, not me.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Passworded pdf:
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.pdf
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The password for that file is: 2plus2isFour
&gt; &gt; &gt; Instructions, if you need them for the other files, are also in that RJ
&gt; &gt; &gt; folder.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So to the results:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Number of participants: 6
&gt; &gt; &gt; Total tries: 29
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ambiguous answers: 0
&gt; &gt; &gt; Correct answers: 0
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Object: Chair
&gt; &gt; &gt; Object picture:
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.jpg
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; As a little side experiment, on Monday I also asked if anyone had
&gt; gotten
&gt; &gt; &gt; any answers that might indicate an article of clothing (though I did
&gt; not say
&gt; &gt; &gt; why I was asking). One theory is that the human operator can be
&gt; influenced
&gt; &gt; &gt; by things they already know or suspect, and so interpret audio with
&gt; their
&gt; &gt; &gt; own personal &#x27;educated guesses&#x27;, that would differ from what they would
&gt; hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; had they not known those things. This side experiment did indicate some
&gt; &gt; &gt; support for that theory, since before I mentioned &#x27;articles of
&gt; clothing&#x27;, no
&gt; &gt; &gt; one included an article of clothing in their results. But after I
&gt; mentioned
&gt; &gt; &gt; it, several reports of clothing began to appear. I did not add these
&gt; tries
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the results above.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let
&gt; me
&gt; &gt; &gt; know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this experiment.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
