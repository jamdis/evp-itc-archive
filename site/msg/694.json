To be frightened, or seek the \nsensational.\n\n\nI had other comments, but I doubt if it would come accross as anything but \nbeing negative, so I deleted that.  Suffice to say I still have doubts,  if \nno one else can use my boxes and get anything that resembles in the \nslightest what I get, I can&#39;t tell if the boxes work, and if few can hear \nthe voices that I get, hearing instead broadcast fragments, I have to \nquestion my own perception. Even after seven years, I don&#39;t know what to \nmake of this. Yes, there&#39;s something communicating in EVP, no, I don&#39;t know \nwhat &quot;it&quot; is, and no I don&#39;t think I have a good system yet.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nTurn searches into helpful donations.
