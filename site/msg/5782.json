Well, i was cleaning up today and came across it.  I \nturned it on and just held down the scan button and it scans through \nall the stations non-stop as long as you keep it pressed down.  Which \nis no big deal since the recorded sessions for me are only usually 10 \nMin. tops. This model has been out for years and you can pick it up \nat your local Circuit city or Best buy, it&#39;s even on Ebay for $20.  \nCircuit city i think is like $30.  You have to plug headphones into \nit or an external speaker, but it fits in the palm of your hand and \nthe reception is better than all the rest.  It runs off of 1 AAA \nbattery and lasts forever.  For those who are afraid to hack a radio, \njust pick this model up and hold the scan button down and away you go \nright out of the packaging.  I did open it up and there is a ribbon, \nbut nothing was clearly marked so i will have to find the schematics \nonline before i mess with it.  The radio has AM/FM/WB/TV, however \nwhen i did the trial scans i found that the AM worked best and \ninstantly received answers to my questions.  I turned it on and asked \nif this is working and loud and clear they said &quot;yes&quot;.  Oh, it&#39;s \nmodel # SRF-M37V.\n\nI&#39;ll post more when the ideas hit me.\n\n-Steve H."}
