AM *loves*=\r\n to shoot straight up because of the bounce (as you HAM guys know) but TV a=\r\nnd FM wants as much power as possible to be at the top for the farthest lin=\r\ne of sight broadcast.\n\nI was amazed to read that you guys got FM chatter on=\r\n the recorder.  I guess it is possible in theory but I would never had expe=\r\ncted that.  Just goes to show why it is all radio theory and not radio proo=\r\nf or law :))  Those EM fields are tricky little buggers.\n\nDon\n\n\n--- On Mon,=\r\n 12/15/08, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@=\r\nprairienet.org&gt;\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Of Radio Interference and equipm=\r\nent...\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Monday, December 15, 2008, 9:09 AM=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat&#39;s only true of a simple dipole.

Radio radiates out kind of like a do=\r\nnut turned on it&#39;s side.  So directly under, up to a dozen or so feet from =\r\na tower has zero transmission.\n&gt;\n&gt; It kind of looks like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;   |\n&gt;  (=\r\n|)\n&gt; ------\n&gt;\n&gt; Where the parenthesis are the radio waves.  Except they do =\r\nnot really get that close to the tower base.\n&gt;\n&gt; The point of the strongest=\r\n signal is a little past the height of the tower.  So if the tower is 100&#39; =\r\nthen if you move away from the tower to about 110&#39; or so that is the most p=\r\nowerful signal.\n&gt;\n&gt; Don\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; . I also tried the local police and some micr=\r\nowave towers,\n&gt;\n&gt; right under the towers, and heard nothing from those sour=\r\nces. But they\n&gt;\n&gt; are on much higher frequencies than AM or FM radio and ar=\r\ne not known to\n&gt;\n&gt; get into any electronics around here.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Zack\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; _,___\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n \r\n------=_20081215110201_37573\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;font face=3D&quot;arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;The place where the interference was m=\r\nost noticeable was at ft mifflin - near the philly airport.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I do=\r\nn&#39;t really understand radio theory or any of that stuff, but I wondered if =\r\nthat (proximity to the airport)&nbsp;had anything to do with it.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;I have also noticed in certain areas a huge increase in interference at ni=\r\nght compared to during the day i the same location.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;Laurie&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-----Original Message-----&lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;don powell&quot; &lt;dp=\r\nowell7299@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Monday, December 15, 2008 10:29am&lt;BR&gt;To: E=\r\nVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Of Radio Interference =\r\nand equipment...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp{\n  bo=\r\nrder: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n  font-family: Arial;\n  margin: 14px 0px;\n  paddin=\r\ng: 0px 14px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp hr{\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd{\n=\r\n  color: #628c2a;\n  font-size: 85%;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  line-height: 122=\r\n%;\n  margin: 10px 0px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads{\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp=\r\n .ad{\n  padding: 0 0;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a{\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-decoratio=\r\nn: none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 borde=\r\nr=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD vAlign=3Dtop&gt;Well I was simplifying but most broadc=\r\nast antennas are setup for very little radiation directly below as well as =\r\nabove as it is a waste of power.&nbsp; AM *loves* to shoot straight up beca=\r\nuse of the bounce (as you HAM guys know) but TV and FM wants as much power =\r\nas possible to be at the top for the farthest line of sight broadcast.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;I was amazed to read that you guys got FM chatter on the recorder.&nbsp;=\r\n I guess it is possible in theory but I would never had expected that.&nbsp=\r\n; Just goes to show why it is all radio theory and not radio proof or law :=\r\n))&nbsp; Those EM fields are tricky little buggers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Don&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-=\r\n-- On &lt;B&gt;Mon, 12/15/08, Zack Widup &lt;I&gt;&lt;w9sz@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; w=\r\nrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-=\r\nLEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Of Radio Interference and equipment...&lt;BR&gt;T=\r\no: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Monday, December 15, 2008, 9:09 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv308562565&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That&#39;s only true of=\r\n a simple dipole.
