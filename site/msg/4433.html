<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think. I&#x27;m still having a hard time convincing myself that I&#x27;m not  
matrixing this whole thing, but the box has been repeating the number  
seven, the name Frank, the name Eva, had a bout of swearing, and then  
completely stunning me by seemingly saying that Tom was here, &quot;Your  
Tom.&quot; Which blew me away because I have a great uncle named Tom whose  
burial records I was looking for just last night. Finally a female  
voice told me, &quot;Ann stop.&quot; I said okay and she returned, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

I hope no one minds my sharing. This is a big moment for me.
