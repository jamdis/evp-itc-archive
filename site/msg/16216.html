Exactly my point. Which is why you can't=
 say that most EVP is due to PK. You can hold it as your opinion, but it is=

    Please note that I used t=
he word 'evidence' not proof. We are working here in what is best called an=
 'edge' or 'border' science. This is the province of theoretical constructs=
, frameworks and models. It is not applied science. The sort of proofs impl=
ied in the response below are meaningful in applied research, such as in th=
e physical sciences. Unfortunately, this research has not yet advanced to t=
hat stage. And for that reason, it is premature to suggest that such proofs=
 should be expected at this juncture. 

  We use terms like 'suggests' and =
'implies' precisely for this reason. Nothing is known for certain, and it w=
ould be (and is) irresponsible to suggest to the contrary at this point. 

=
  What we seek in our models is consistency with observations. What I have =
done here is to provide reports of observations which suggest a coherent li=
nk that in turn provides one possible explanation to the phenomena in quest=
ion.

  I would suggest that a "proof" might be had if anyone could describ=
e a condition wherein no belief per se were required and the only explanati=
on of a phenomenon were due to discarnate activity. This means that no alte=
rnative explanation is allowable. Hundreds of quite brilliant people have t=
ried for well over a century to find this one thing and thus far, have been=
 unsuccessful.
