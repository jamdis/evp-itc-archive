Bruce,
 
First of all, I have a life and am not home doing the research eve=
ry  day.  I 
have to work to pay my mortgage like everyone else.  Oh I know=
  some people 
don't have to and can sit in their basements all day long an=
d play  with a box. 
 But do not ridicule everyone else who has to work and=
 cannot  do this on the 
level that you do.  And I would even include the p=
erson who  started this 
forum who by the way does work a full-time job.  I=
 also  thought this was a 
public forum?  I guess I was mistaken and have t=
o beg  for your permission to be on 
here and especially to post my respons=
e on this  PUBLIC FORUM?
 
I have only posted (2) files on here and yes I d=
id get a response from  them. 
 Funny how I got an immediate response from =
Mr. Sumption about them  but I 
never got a response from you.  Maybe I sho=
uld of put out an all  points 
bulletin out that I posted theses files on h=
ere?  Either way I did  post and I got an 
immediate response and I was ver=
y flattered that Mr. Sumption  did take his 
time to listen to them and ack=
nowlegde them and comment.
 
I do not pretend to be anyone special on this =
forum.  But I do  consider 
myself a fellow researcher which I take it you =
do not consider  me.  I really 
don't care because those who know me actual=
ly know my  capabilities and believe in 
me.  Which we have recently proven=
 on a  specific location which cannot be 
named at this time.  And just exa=
ctly who  do you think you are that you can be 
voicing your so-called disc=
ontent with me  when you do not even know me.  This 
again is something tha=
t should have  been done in a private email and not on 
this forum.  This j=
ust re-enforces  my personal opinion of certain people in 
this field claim=
ing to do so-called  RESEARCH.
 
If you so desire to keep up with this atti=
tude please do it privately.  
People on this forum do not need to see this=
 kind of thing on here.    Again I will 
say that this is suppose to be a P=
UBLIC Forum and if I am mistaken  I wish 
someone would please explain it t=
o me again.  And would you please  do all of us 
a favor and proof-read you=
r posts before you send them.  Your  spelling is 
that of a 5th grader.  Ar=
e you smarter than a 5th grader?
 
This will be my last and only response t=
o you regarding this subject.   But I 
will just state that I do not apprec=
iate your bashing of other fellow  
researchers on here.  And I am sure tha=
t the other fellow researchers on  this forum 
do not appreciate it either.=
  So please have a little more  respect for 
everyone on here.
 
Jeff

Laura,

DON"T BE HATIN!!

Firs=
t off the reason  I got a new box From Frank is because he recognises 
that=
 
I am a  serious researcher, It does not have anything to do with being a =
man  
or woman. It has to do with being deserving of a Frank's box and  evi=
dently!

Well do I have to spell it out? Start putting some  time into your=
 research 
instead of
taking tantrums and maybe someday  you'll have a Fran=
k's box, But I doubt it!
