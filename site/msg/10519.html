Why do you call 33 the Devils Box, everybody is scared of?

Maybe, if I quit going off on tangents, and just get some boards 
professionally done....

I did have a couple boards made last fall for the LA1816, but the 
radio turned out to be just c-r-a-p-p-eee, I just set them aside. 
One all the wiring is done, and one is just the bare board. They are 
mostly SMT components. If there are some real techno-gurus out 
there, I don't have a problem giving these boards away. The AM band 
works, but it's kinda noisy, which could be just the wrong choice of 
IF cans, or maybe the RF amp. These are second gen boards for the 
LA1816, the first one I had the pin spacing too close for the radio 
chip. They have RVG, and linear, which also may contribute to noise. 
Randy Schnieder has one of these, that was 25, now I can't remember 
what I did with 26, the ones I have on hand would be 28, and as yet 
an unassigned number. Oh yeah, Randy went halfers with the cost, so 
he has 26. 

1 sits on my shelf.

mini boards. hummm, there should be three of these.
15-Randy's
16--was there a 16?
17 Don't remember
18 not finished -these were the first home made tuenr boards, and
not so good.

31--Hand wired using car AM tuner module--Ann's
32-- " " " " " " Going out bill Murphy

33 Hand wired LA1135, the devil box everyone is scared of. 

34=hand wired with car tuner==goni got Chip Coffey, if he ever
e-mails back.
35-hand wired ultra compact LA1135, not finished--mine
36 hand wired using the RS '469 as the tuner- almost finished

That's fine with me, I feel great about being a member of this 
group, and making some friends. Maybe some day I might be able to 
use what I learn from y'all to build something for myself.
