<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I heard the entire message to include your name Frank. I recently got
one of these also. I also got a recent wake-up message too. That was
interesting. LOL

&gt;           I think linear sweep works just as well as the random mode
i had been using

it had 
&gt; to be random, and that was the assumption I was working from the
past five 
&gt; years. So all I can say for sure is that if we supply an audio
source that 
&gt; the spirits/entities can make a voice out of, they will. They use
what we 
&gt; use, and I don&#x27;t it matters alot what you use, there is no one
system, or 
&gt; method,..... no right, or correct way.
&gt; 
&gt; I avve to ask, -----if no one is is listening do the spirits still
speak?
&gt; 
&gt; Frank--late for work agian!!
