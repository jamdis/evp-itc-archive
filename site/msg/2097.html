Very true, Frank! The ghosts who are producing the EVP's certainly don't 
have brains. :-)

I have no doubt that there may be a few people around who could create EVP 
phenomena in an electrronic device, but it would be an extremely small 
number. I think most of the EVP we get are from disembodied beings who 
have figured out how to do it.
