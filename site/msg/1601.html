I think he must have meant he was going. He unjoined?  And yes I remember quite a few of your "arguements" and the outcomes. You dont need reminding nor do I. Hehehe
   
  Fights and namecalling are far different topics than debate or discussion. I would hope everyone is here for the latter. This isnt Evp-Fight-Club and the discussions have been quite beneficial and making some progress. You know better than anyone how distracting and unhealthy it can be as well as interfere with the work going on. 
   
  I think the guys have decided to be adults and let it rest so nobodys been banned. If not they can take it into private discussion between themselves and leave the rest of us out of it.
   
  We all do much better working together for the goal we all have in common. We are all students learning and hoping to improve. It's not a contest.
