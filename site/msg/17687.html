You claim I don't listen to any of this stuff because I can't take the chan=
ce I might hear something.=C2=A0 I do listen to some of them.=C2=A0=C2=A0 I=
 hear stuff.=C2=A0 But I don't hear anything that I can't explain by simple=
 pareidolia or random radio transmissions. So you're wrong there.

In fact,=
 to try to control for my own pareidolia, that is why I suggest the files n=
ot be labeled or explained.=C2=A0 That would help make listening to them a =
little less likely to be influenced by the perceptions of others, or made t=
o "fit their personal expectation" as you noted.

I continue to be at a los=
s as to why Frank is so defensive when people disagree with him.=C2=A0 If I=
 don't listen or comment, Frank attacks me.=C2=A0 If I do listen and 
comme=
nt, Frank attacks me.=C2=A0 Is there no room for individuality and personal=
 opinion?
