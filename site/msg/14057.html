Frank =E2=80=93 I think I disagree with you here.=C2=A0 Science is not just=
 about the evidence, it=E2=80=99s about the entire process, including how t=
he evidence is collected and how (and by whom) it is interpreted.=C2=A0 Thi=
s is why a valuable tool in the scientific arsenal is the double (and tripl=
e) blind study.=C2=A0 It attempts to remove the often uncontrollable subjec=
tivity inherent in all people, even scientists!=C2=A0 Science uses this tec=
hnique to help keep even itself as honest as possible.=C2=A0 So if you are =
finding that the evidence is being ignored, the reason may not be the evide=
nce itself (no matter how compelling). It may very well be the manner in wh=
ich it is collected, and interpreted: all at least as important as the audi=
o itself.

EVP=E2=80=99s are perfectly allowed to throw monkey wrenches, an=
d even kitchen sinks into scientific theories and accepted dogmas: but only=
 if they follow science=E2=80=99s rules.=C2=A0 It=E2=80=99s like trying to =
put a new medicine on the market with claims that it destroys accepted dogm=
as: but, if the testing has not been rigorous and up to accepted medical st=
andards, its hard to blame consumers for being doubtful of its claims.

Sci=
ence is not magic: it is a simple process really, but it forces a claim to =
really be solidly confirmed. It seems to me that, while EVP research has it=
s toe in the water of scientific methodology (it is making observations, co=
llecting evidence, and making theories), it seems to be obsessed on that ph=
ase of science, and not on the hard part: designing and conducting objectiv=
e tests to conform or dismiss the theories.=C2=A0 It seems that so many peo=
ple are having so much fun with their audio devices and results, that they =
are maybe afraid of taking it to the next step of serious testing, maybe be=
cause of the risk this testing could destroy their fun.

But they should ma=
ybe consider it might NOT destroy their fun, but instead that next phase of=
 testing may be just what the doctors ordered to bring EVP into mainline sc=
ience: real, science-based testing.=C2=A0 I fear the people accepted as the=
 real experts and pioneers in this field (like you Frank) will never get an=
y acknowledgement of their achievements unless they have are able to move i=
nto this next phase.

Science wants you to piss on its fire, Frank.=C2=A0 B=
ut you have to go where the fire is.=C2=A0=C2=A0 And the way there is throu=
gh the entire scientific method, not just the early fun parts, but the hard=
 testing parts.=C2=A0 But I understand how difficult that prospect can be, =
and that it would take your focus off the part you seem to like best (exper=
imenting with the equipment).=C2=A0 If you are unable to bring yourself to =
the testing phase, it might be worth looking at partnering up with others w=
ho would focus on that part for you?=C2=A0 I think a very dynamic team of p=
eople could be formed with you focused on the technology creation, and they=
 focused on the more mundane aspects of rigorous blind study testing.=C2=A0=
 Do you think that would be valuable to you, and to the field of EVP studie=
