There are several models available:\n&gt; some have built in IR lights, some have IR / UV lights, some are set-up for\n&gt; sky watching, and others are just plain ol&#39; full spectrum.\n&gt;\n&gt; With this camera (depending on the model, a regular one with the different\n&gt; options run around $120-150), you will also need the power supply ($12-$20),\n&gt; a tripod, and a portable recorder.  My group uses 2 of them and each one is\n&gt; attached to a portable DVD recorder that has a small LCD screen, you can\n&gt; find these refurbished for under $100.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tim\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sun, Dec 12, 2010 at 3:51 PM, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=kalinu@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    oh one more thing just because something say full spectrem does not\n&gt; mean it actually full spectrum the camera i have is the one that ghost\n&gt; adventures,ghost hunter,Bill murpghy etc have...this is the one to get!\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Sun, 12/12/10, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=kalinu@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=kalinu@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Full Spectrum Cameras\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Sunday, December 12, 2010, 2:31 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   lol my husband surprised me with one to :)\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Sun, 12/12/10, draiga1 &lt;mail@...&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=mail@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: draiga1 &lt;mail@mysticcauldron.com&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=mail@mysticcauldron.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Full Spectrum Cameras\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Sunday, December 12, 2010, 12:11 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to get a full spectrum camera.
