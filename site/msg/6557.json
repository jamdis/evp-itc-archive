Just letting you all know I have posted \nsome new RS 12-469 files as MP3 files to save space. I hope you all \nenjoy them as some of these are very interesting. I doubt if any radio \nstations said any of what I posted on here from the RS Hack Box. You \ncan tell me what your thoughts are on them if you like. Maybe some of \nyou may understand what they are trying to say. Oh well you all take \ncare for now and keep up the good work people. I do like the one that \ncalled me a &quot; Dumb shit &quot; LOL when I asked &quot; who are the Shadow \nPeople ? &quot; They are funny sometimes. You gotta love it. The RS 20-125 \nmodel seems to be alittle clearer with less clutter I think. Will post \nsome of those when I get a chance. Happy Sweeping everyone !!!\n\n\nRegards,\n\nRalph the Ghost Hunter"}
