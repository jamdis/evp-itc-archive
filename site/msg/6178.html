Ann   During my somnabulism at 3 a.m. this morning I recorded about a minute and one-half from inside my home.  Again the RS 469 patched directly to the recorder.  I got no voices that I can hear after invoking the name Helen but I did pick up a lot of TONES  that sound a bit melodic.  What is even stranger is that when I turned off the recorder and radio I heard the faint tinkling of metal windchimes just outside my home that had a similar sound.  Don't know if there is any significance there or what causes the tones.  Never had them before. 
   
  I will post a few seconds of the session here and the full minute or so in my files.
   
  I will still try a session at the same hour later today as when I heard the name Helen.  Cheers   Ron

This is actually the first (two) messages that I personally believe I heard so it will be a stretch for me, probably, to both ask a question and get a response.  Nice thought...someday, maybe...hopefully.  I will test it tomorrow at the same time of day and location outside...probably no rain though.  From Mexico   Ron L

      Ron,   

  I do have someone close to me on the other side names Helen who I have been asking after. Perhaps you can ask if this Helen is for me.

  I am posting two short sessions for hopefully others to comment on.  This is completed with a RS 469 going directly into my handheld digital recorder.  Coincidentally, I am outside in a light rain so maybe it is ideal for me here in Mexico where I get few signals.
  At first I thought I heard the word BUENO (hello in Spanish) but I now hear DINO with is my wife's name...short for Dinorah.  She is normally not with me for sessions and was not with me for this session so I doubt what I am hearing.  Any comments would be appreciated. 
  The other recording I hear the name HELEN.  I don't know anyone with that name.  Ron L
