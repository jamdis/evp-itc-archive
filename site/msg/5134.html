Nick,
 
You are a new member and a possible researcher so I do not want to=
 get off on the wrong foot
It sounds like you may have taken what I said as=
 criticism, It was not meant to be.
Just experienced advice. There are some=
 researchers that believe it is beneficial to leave 
a box running and unat=
tended, so that our spirit friends can "imprint" to the frequency of the bo=
x
 
That is not at all necessary, Spirit techs do need to imprint to certai=
n boxes but do so through two way communication
you see they also imprint t=
he energy signature of the user of the box also. And that can only be accom=
plished through 
communicative interaction during a session. If the box is =
left unattended they may only accomplish half of what they need to do.
 
Al=
so I have had first hand experience with certain researchers that do practi=
ce this lackadaisical us of a box and had begun to 
get less and less commu=
nication during attempts at actual sessions and eventually nothing but nega=
tive entities coming through.
I am not saying this is solely due to doing a=
n absent session which is what I have come to call it, It entails man6y fac=
tors.
 
But the absent session practice definitely contributes to the ultim=
ate failure of communication. 
Nick, it is better for you to establish soli=
d research practices in the beginning that will serve to enhance your commu=
nication 
skills and growth in the future.
 
Remember your spirit contacts =
or "technicians" will become not only the facilitators of your link and com=
munication from the
other side but they will become your trusted friends an=
d protectors. you would never leave your buddy on the phone and go 
on to s=
omething else while he remained on the line calling for you to speak with h=
im. Our spirit friends where people just like us
at one time and the emotio=
ns we carry in the physical also carry over to our spirit lives.
 
I hope y=
ou do not take this as preaching or criticism it is just experience from co=
mmunicating with my own techs and friends
and gathering information on what=
 they feel and expect from us as researchers.
Remember all we have to do is=
 turn on a box and listen and record their job to send the communication 
n=
o matter how short the phrase or word is a 1000x harder for them so don't y=
ou think they deserve a 100% 
of our attention when we open the lines of co=
mmunication.
 
Also in closing let me say that my belief on "imprinting" of=
 a box is for boxes like Frank's box and the mini box, for the simple
reaso=
n that they are individually made and each carry a slightly different frequ=
ency range, indicative to that particular box.
The radio shack hack box on =
the other hand is manufactured in china most likely on an automated assembl=
y line so each
circuit board is exactly like the next, this being the case =
I believe that when our friends imprinted on the first of the RS boxes
it w=
as sufficient for most of the others. That is why people experience immedia=
te communication right out of the box.
 
So therefore the RS box does not n=
eed that grace period to "Imprint"
 
These comments and statements are my o=
wn hypothesis based on my own extensive research with every type of box tha=
t is made to date
and I am only offering it so that it may help others to a=
void the toil and mistakes that I have endured.
 
thanks for giving me the =
soap box once again!
