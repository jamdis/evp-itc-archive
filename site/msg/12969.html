<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>For whom do you write?  Where can we read some of your previously
published material??  Based on your question, I&#x27;m assuming you aren&#x27;t
looking to do the field of EVP/ITC or other paranormal research any
favors.  What is your intention???

How about focusing on something positive?  That would be a nice change
of pace from the media.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find anyone here that is
willing to help perpetuate the negative stereotypical views on our
research or other nonsense that is a distraction from the fact that
there are valuable EVP/ITC advances taking place.

Anyone hear from 
&gt; someone with a dire warning? Anything else otherwise weird? I am a
journalist and would 
&gt; LOVE to interview you about it!
