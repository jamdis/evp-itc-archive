<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey, I&#x27;d look at this (if true) as something positive and not 
something to fear.  A white cloud to me sounds like &quot;light&quot; and just 
may be a good spirit/entity or whoever, in the home. How do we know 
that this was a negative spirit/ghost trying to bring others through 
an electronic device and into a home for mischief???  ;)

I personally do not subscribe to the whole portal thing.  If so, then 
my house would be filled with ghosts after all my watching of 
innumerable paranormal TV shows!  I think my TV would make a much 
better portal than my radios...  :)

&gt; for all researchers,
&gt; 
&gt; THIS IS NOT FOR THE REASON OF PUSHING A PANIC BUTTON OR A MATTER OF 
&gt; GIVING IN TO FEAR. 
&gt; 
&gt; It is simply an incident that I feel researchers should be aware of 
&gt; as a possibility. Given in my opinion the boxes do open a portal 
due 
&gt; to the connection necessary for real time two way communication, 
and 
&gt; the wide spread belief that entities can and do manipulate physical 
&gt; objects when in the presence of them.
&gt; 
&gt; I have just been made aware of a situation that has happened to a 
&gt; fairly new researcher whom I believe to be honest and forthcoming.
&gt; 
&gt; the incident involved the aftermath of a regular RS box session. 
The 
&gt; researcher had finished his session with the practice of asking 
that 
&gt; any entities that may have traveled through the box, return and 
asked 
&gt; for conformation, then proceeded to end the session and turn the 
box 
&gt; off. he was assured that he turned the box off by going back to the 
&gt; recording after the incident and validating verbally that he did in 
&gt; fact turn off the box.
&gt; 
&gt; He left the room for a few moments , when he returned he allegedly  
&gt; witnessed a white cloud move across the room and noticed that his 
RS 
&gt; box was turned on and running.
&gt; 
&gt; This is actually the first instance I have encountered where the 
&gt; possibility of an entity that may have
&gt; 
&gt; purposely stayed behind to turn the box back on and let other 
&gt; entities through. matter of fact
&gt; 
&gt; that concept has not occurred to me before. but now sounds very 
&gt; possible.
&gt; 
&gt; This may even happen at times we are never aware of and they 
actually 
&gt; turn the box on and when 
&gt; whatever comes through is through they turn it off again and we are 
&gt; none the wiser.
&gt; 
&gt; I will definitely address this in my sessions, what I suggest is 
&gt; until we come to a mutual agreement among researchers
&gt; on this occurrence, I think it best that when we end a session we 
&gt; remove at least one battery from the box to prevent it being turned
&gt; back on.
