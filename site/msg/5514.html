<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Debbie--right now, I have to say that I think a lot of us here-- 
Bruce, me, Frank S., Steve H., and lots of others--are all  
communicating with at least some common entities. More people have  
heard the name/number &quot;Seven&quot; than is statistically conceivable. An  
entity called Lisa seems to visit at least three of us. I&#x27;m getting  
the name David, which seems to have a connection to others on this  
list. And I hear Frank S.&#x27;s people calling &quot;Purple&quot; an astounding  
number of times every time I do a session.

What&#x27;s happening right now is very interesting. Which is why my ears  
perked up when someone--can&#x27;t recall who off the top of my head right  
now (sorry)--posted a message containing &quot;Big Circle,&quot; which I  
recognize as a group of AA-EVP researchers with which you and I are  
both familiar.

I think this development is both astounding and fascinating and  
thrilling.

I know it doesn&#x27;t exactly answer your question, but it is food for  
thought.

Debbie--can either post that astounding clip from your site (the one  
with them exclaiming &quot;Who is that?&quot; when they hear you and &quot;That&#x27;s  
fabulous!&quot; after you answer) or post the URL. To me, that clip is the  
epitome of two-communication.

&gt; I&#x27;ve swept &quot;Manually&quot;, used the &quot;MiniBox&quot; and the &quot;SuperBox&quot; and there
&gt; seems to be a different set of people on each device.
