Here is my problem. I have a digital recorder and it saves the files in WMA format. I tried saving the file in .wav, but it wont let me.  I have a 4 minute tape, but only need about 30 seconds of the tape as that is where I got my response. I am not very technical... This is frustrating as the EVP I got is really clear. i assume I can play the recorder and tape it again with sound recorder but then I lose clarity, I would imagine....  Does media player allow an edit of a file to take out x number of seconds and save to a .wav? have any ideas

  If you want to do a quick edit...you can do it using the sound recorder that comes with Windows. Just go to the start menu, all programs, accessories, entertainment, sound recorder....you can set the position of the marker to before the question and answer and delete the first part and then put the marker so its after and delete the rest...just make sure to save the new one u make separately from the .wav file otherwise you'll lose the whole thing.  I would make a copy of the .wav and save it else where just to be safe.  That's an option if ya don't know which program you want to D/L yet.  You can do some pretty cool stuff using that recorder too, speed things up, slow em down, play em backwards, add echo, etc.  Pretty nifty for just a basic lil thing.

        I used my 12-469 for the first time this morning, and ran a 4 minute tape session. One of the questions I asked was, "When a person dies, do they see a white light?"  After I asked this question the second time, I got a very distinct and crisp YES.  How can I save just that section of the file? Do I need to do that in the recorder, or can I do it in the .wave file I now have saved on my computer of the whole recording.
