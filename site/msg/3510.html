 I think with forms of the "box" now available commercially, and with the =
current experiments with other radio, and electronic methods, that the tesi=
ng period for my original boxes is now over, and such boxes being used expr=
essly for testing should be returned so they can be "evaluated", or dispose=
d of as being obsolete. Although this is only a request, and not applicable=
 to those that received boxes as "gifts" as a way of promoting or sharing t=
he technology.
