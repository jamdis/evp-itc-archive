Is there welding involved? (I dont do it)\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I KNEW I should have played with the older boys building radios \nwhen I was in school.

So for the technically \nchallenged (like me) perhaps you could lay out a mock instruction \nplan with a pic or two?\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I know quite a few on the group dont need it, and probably \nunderstand what you are saying completely. \n&gt; \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt; kenneth b thomas &lt;kennnthomas2000@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           thanks for taking the trouble to look, Bill.\n&gt; \n&gt; i have a yahoo messenger webcam set up for members of franks-evp \nonly \n&gt; for better explanatios/demonstrations. if anyone wants an evp \n&gt; competent (or wtf) 1n34 to plug into their tape machine AND is a \n&gt; member of this group only , i&#39;ll send them out as long as i can \n&gt; afford it/can spare time. worth the effort IMO for patient detail \n&gt; conscious researchers which evp-ers seem to be. the described \n&gt; procedure should work on first or second try for those that can put \n&gt; together crystal receiver and plug it into amplifier.--with smal \ncap \n&gt; to ground plug, you could even do it with a tape recorder. all long \n&gt; wires that can act as antennas can then be removed and only diode \nor \n&gt; diode and tuned circuit employed. whole assembly can be rotated to \n&gt; block out radio stations.\n&gt; \n&gt; kthomas\n&gt; \n&gt; &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the intriguing post!\n&gt; &gt; -Bill\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kenneth b thomas&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;kennnthomas2000@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; possibly related:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fooling around with thunder:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; we&#39;re getting those drenching t-storms with the low lightning \n&gt; between \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the trees , typical of jupiter passing between earth and \ngalactic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; center so april 6 should be best evp time in awhile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tonite:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; heated anode gold whisker end with one match . in live circuit \n&gt; tuned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to strong local station.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; when match was two thirds burned, white noise started. match \nwas \n&gt; put \n&gt; &gt; &gt; out. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; now there is a steady 20mv* across input with diode in place. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; previously 0 mv. no difference when diode is reversed.. diode \n&gt; &gt; &gt; removed, v drops to zero. formerly strong local station was \n&gt; barely \n&gt; &gt; &gt; audible with good audio amp. now it is at normal listening \n&gt; volume. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; diode is noisy, but beneath what you can hear when tuned to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; station. &quot;lumpy&quot; white noise; white noise with larger scale \n&gt; order \n&gt; &gt; &gt; appearing and vanishing- unpredictably , like candle flame- but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; averaging about 3-15 times per second\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; other am receivers still full of crashing static from long gone \nt-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; storm.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tank circuit +diode + audio amp= no lightning crashes \n&gt; whatsoever. no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; line noise. no fluorescent light 60hz buzz.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ken Thomas &lt;kennnthomas2000@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; im making som noise sources as soon as i collapse for awhile by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; holding a soldering iron to either end of 1n34 diode in live \n&gt; &gt; &gt; circuit. injection of gold from point contact into germanium \n&gt; block \n&gt; &gt; &gt; forms defect type dopant and microscopic p or n+ later junction \n&gt; which \n&gt; &gt; &gt; has low back threshold and is very noisy but low amplitude. \n&gt; noise \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that issues from an infinitely smal point source seems to work \n&gt; better \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for some reason. i just hold a match or soldering on there \n&gt; while \n&gt; &gt; &gt; listening to amplified noise till i get something that sounds \ngood\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * 20mv average, larger scale prigogine fluctuations up to 75mv. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; unpredictable but not completely random--pinked up due to \n&gt; SOMETHING \n&gt; &gt; &gt; UNIDENTIFIED trying to cohere. amplified 3-15 per second \nvoltage \n&gt; &gt; &gt; peaks drive sweep. random except for voice or other coherent \n&gt; energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-\nboxes@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s excatly what I get with an automated system.
