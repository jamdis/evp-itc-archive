Hi Frank,

I'm new to this group - as of a day! - but I have certainly list=
ened to all the clips you have uploaded. I will say it's a challenge to hea=
r exactly what you have transcribed for every file. However, I do hear some=
 of it. Since I don't have such an instrument and certainly not a lot of te=
ch experience, I'm sure you're right that I'm tuning my ear to hear the usu=
al EVPs recorded with digital recorders, etc. I am curious whether, with pr=
actice, my hearing will become more attuned to pick out chains of words, ph=
rases as you have been able to do. Right now, I'll just hear one word or tw=
o out of a clip that might have five words, for example. One thing I'm curi=
ous to know is whether any type of sound transmitted can be considered 'up =
for grabs,' so to say, as being an EVP? For example, in some of the EVPs I'=
ve heard on here as well as ones that Christopher Moon played on his Coast =
to Coast show back in March, some sounded like snippets of a song even. Thi=
s
 leads me to think that we who are untrained could be missing quite a bit=
 since it could not be the sounds we are expecting.

Then again, you may ju=
st have an innate sense/talent for this! I do appreciate you sharing these =
and I read every email!

Take care,
Lisa

I=
 think many join this group expecting the old type EVP voices, like ghost h=
unters get. This is more ITC, instrumental trans-communication . Using Elec=
tronics, or instruments, to enhance the communication, voices, and images. =

 
 I still get discouraged, as most here don't seem to hear the voices, or=
 at least never comment, it's like there's only three members, and all (3) =
of us don't really need the validation of others hearing the voices. The pu=
rpose of sharing, I think, is to show what's possible, and that there is mo=
re to this than haunted houses, and whispery noises that may or may not be =
voices. For the most part it seems pretty damn useless to have a group when=
 no one hears the stuff anyway, and I've gone over and over this same theme=
, time and again. 
 
 I think I need a break!
