This is where I tend to get confused.

Misty said the ghost modulates?=A0 B=
ut I've also heard it said it is not the noise, but the words, that the gho=
sts select from the broadcasts?=A0=A0 And some people say that it is someth=
ing more ephrmeral, that every hears differently because it has t to be mea=
nt for each individual.

Could someone set me straight here?=A0 Maybe Frank=
 S?=A0

I think that the only positive I could see 
out of manual swe=
ep is that you will have a natural=A0irregularness to the 
speed at which y=
ou sweep.
=A0
Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't think 
that manual swee=
ping means you=A0search for words necessarily. I mean the aim 
should be th=
e same as automatic sweep=A0in that you just turn the knob back 
and forth =
without reason.

I thought the idea behind the

        relevant words they want =

If so, 
        then doesn't the manual sweep=
 completely override that process, since it 
        is you that is turning=
 the knob, and just looking for words you 
        personally think are rel=
evant?

                You can also do a man=
