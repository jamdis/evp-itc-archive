It does not respond to 60 Hz fields.\nThe problem I have with it is that it is too darned sensitive. It registers\nthe magnetic field of the earth in magnetic and combination mode and\nwhenever I turn or move too quickly, the meter flicks. If I run it in\nelectric field mode it does not do this but I&#39;m always afraid of missing\nsomething, so I generally run it in combination mode.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Tue, Nov 9, 2010 at 9:17 AM, Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Like Zack said, nobody knows for sure.  The only thing that we do know is\n&gt; that there is a correlation between spikes in EMF&#39;s and paranormal events.\n&gt;  I have used various meters during GB sessions and there is a correlation at\n&gt; times, but this has to be discounted solely because a radio uses part of the\n&gt; EMF spectrum.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is theorized that EMF measurements are to be taken solely in DC current\n&gt; because it is natural electricity.  So any EMF meter you have that measures\n&gt; AC is worthless on an investigation because it picks up man made\n&gt; electricity.  As for the range, well that is also speculative at best.  The\n&gt; most current theories hold that under 30 Hz DC is where you will find the\n&gt; most paranormal activity.  This is because the Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta\n&gt; brainwaves of a human are all below 30 Hz.  This is where the Body Electric\n&gt; fires and consciousness is formed.  If we are dealing with a continuation of\n&gt; consciousness, results are more apt to be found in this range.\n&gt;  Interestingly enough, the earth vibrates in this same range with 5 standing\n&gt; waves at or below 33Hz (Shuman Resonance), so it appears that the new agers\n&gt; are right when they say we vibrate with the Earth.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, as always, no one knows for sure.  And no one knows if these\n&gt; frequencies have anything to do with what we receive in GBC.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Nov 9, 2010 at 5:10 AM, Adriana Jones &lt;adrianamjones@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This has probably already been discussed a hundred times over by people\n&gt;&gt; building ghost boxes, but... what&#39;s the average emf range of ghosts... and\n&gt;&gt; would creating sounds in that emf range make it easier for the ghosts to\n&gt;&gt; communicate?
