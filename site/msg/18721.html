&gt; Hello everyone. I have created a Face Book titled &quot;The Worldwide Radio
&gt; Sweep EVP Alliance&quot; with intent to create a fan base for our cause, a place
&gt; where newcomers can access our yahoo sites from the wall or discussions
&gt; view, and through fan base membership get a feeling for how many of us
&gt; actually exist worldwide.
&gt;
&gt; In conversation with many FB friends, mostly of the paranormal
&gt; investigation group, most of these groups do not believe in nor use Radio
&gt; Sweep technology during their investigations.
&gt;
&gt; Paranormal meetup groups around the country are popping up with intent to
&gt; teach the general public how to perform an investigation using cameras and
&gt; recorders, but again they tend to leave out Radio Sweep as a usable device.
&gt;
&gt; We have a valuable tool that we know can and does bring in paranormal
&gt; messages, but I am in belief that these paranormal groups as well as the
&gt; likes of AAEVP or like organizations are keeping our work hidden away from
&gt; individuals that would benefit from it, as well as have the intelect and
&gt; electronic backgrounds to get in the trenches with us to move our work into
&gt; mainstream.
&gt;
&gt; Setting up this alliance fan page is a start, and I welcome each of you to
&gt; join and post your web pages under discussion, so any newcomers can join
&gt; your groups and perhaps become part of our cause.
