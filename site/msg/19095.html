I love this:

&quot;I feel it&#x27;s at least a *3 PART* dynamic and one which exists between the
device itself, the operator and those on the other side.&quot;

Very succinct and from my experience I find it to be quite true.  For me,
the most uncontrollable aspect of this dynamic is the device itself.  I use
Minibox Pluses and a Joe&#x27;s Box because they work for me.  But, if you put a
Shack Hack in my hands, it works but not nearly as well.  Others experience
amazing results with Shack hacks.  I was experimenting with a Shack Hack
about a month back and the communication wasn&#x27;t clear enough but I got the
gist of what they were saying.  I asked them to hold on while I switched
boxes and the conversation continued with the same guy from the other side.
 The conversations and communicators are there, always.  This is why I put a
premium on the equipment being used because I know that I already have a
connection with the other side that can be facilitated on any box designed
to do so, but only a few boxes have worked to my personal satisfaction so
far.

&gt; *CB* brings up a great point in that each user has their own input and
&gt; individual &quot;key&quot; regarding how well a certain device is going to work for
&gt; them. I think the same holds true for the impetus, energy and intelligence
&gt; behind the GB phenomenon...certainly &quot;they&quot; have just as much to do with it
&gt; as &quot;we&quot; do...(perhaps even more so!).
&gt;
&gt; I feel it&#x27;s at least a *3 PART* dynamic and one which exists between the
&gt; device itself, the operator and those on the other side.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m in agreement that what works best for one might be horrible for another
&gt; (&amp; vice versa) and this is something we could all do well to keep in mind -
&gt; perhaps especially myself as I&#x27;ve been quite harsh with a few devices in the
&gt; past and my own opinion and experience with them is the furthest thing from
&gt; the &quot;holy work&quot; or final word on the subject. Like everyone else here I
&gt; experiment, conduct my sessions, record my work and file my research in
&gt; effort to find what works best FOR ME and garners the greatest results.
&gt;
&gt; Part of what makes this field, our individual work and collective efforts
&gt; so exciting and progressive is that each researcher brings their own
&gt; unique approach and combined experience to the table. I don&#x27;t think ITC
&gt; research would ever grow or progress if everyone used the same devices or
&gt; recorded their sessions in the same way, naturally.
&gt;
&gt; That said, if you&#x27;re still interested in testing and experimenting
&gt; with this device to see if you like it or not, Michael, I&#x27;d be happy to send
&gt; you mine to experiment with if you&#x27;re open to paying for postage and return
&gt; shipping. I&#x27;d rather see the devices in my care and the equipment I&#x27;ve
&gt; invested in be actively used or sold or at least scrapped for parts to
&gt; create other devices when and where possible. Practically any ITC device can
&gt; get some kind of results and who knows? Perhaps the *RT-EVP* will work
&gt; better for you than it has for me...you might even fall in love with it and
&gt; be able to show me all the things I&#x27;ve missed!
&gt;
&gt; Best,
&gt; Jerome
