&gt; Thx Steve
&gt; I should have known that you or Mike or one of you other smart guys would have already
&gt; been there and thought about that......better late than never though.
&gt; As soon as I can find time I will send some of the EVP&#x27;s I have gotten from my Steve&#x27;s box #4
&gt; so you guys can hear them......
&gt; Got another question: My friend Selina has a Steve&#x27;s box ( can&#x27;t remember which # it is right now Steve)
&gt; Selina said that her box works better for me than it does for her....
&gt; Why would her box and my box work better for me than Selina,  she is more sensitive to the paranormal than
&gt; I am? Both of the boxes ask for me...... It&#x27;s so strange.....
&gt; What do you think?

&gt; &gt; I just had a thought go thru my head ( Oh shit ).What would happen if you put a voice recorder in a
&gt; &gt; Faraday Cage, and have a session with a ghost box.... The Faraday Cage isn&#x27;t supposed to pick up radio
&gt; &gt; interference right ? Would it pick up the other voices or not ? I know the entities are talking thru the radio
&gt; &gt; but has anyone ever tried it ? Stupid question huh ?????
