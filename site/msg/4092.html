<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bill,

Hey... that&#x27;s great, getting the word out!  Good for you!!!  I hope 
they have a place to listen to the show in an archived form.  Most 
venues do.  Have fun with the interview.

- Mike

&gt; Hi Joel, if I spoke other languages I would try. There seems to be
&gt; some psychic link between the experimenter and the device so 
responses
&gt; in a language you cannot speak could be challenging.
&gt; 
&gt;  If any of my peers on this forum have statements or observations 
that
&gt; could be shared I will try to work those in tonights interview. I 
went
&gt; ahead and agreed to the interview after first conferring with Frank 
as
&gt; I want this to represent the work done by the members here. -Bill

&gt; &gt; well good luck . hey i was wondering if the tech on the other side
&gt; only understand English or has anyone tried to see if other 
languages
&gt;  would work also ?

&gt; &gt;  last month have invited me for a chat tonight to discuss ITC. 
I&#x27;ll be
&gt; &gt;  on Darknessradio.com at 9 p.m. Pacific time. This message has 
been
&gt; &gt;  posted after speaking to Frank since for me, ITC includes the 
research
&gt; &gt;  that is covered by this group as well as the video ITC 
experiments
&gt; &gt;  I&#x27;ve done. -Bill
