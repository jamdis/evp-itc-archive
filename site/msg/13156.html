Preview of my video:
"Voices From The Scorched Earth"
This 43 minute segme=
nt is missing the final segment (with the other
researchers files) which wi=
ll be taped and inserted in early 2009.
This video segment describes the pl=
ane crash and then details my ITC
sessions done at the crash impact point, =
at the gravesites, and in the
lab using the debris.  I did not put it on Yo=
utube yet as they only
allow 10 minute segments.  I placed it on MySpace si=
nce they allow much
more.  It's kind of lengthy, but I think you'll enjoy t=
he research and
hearing (and seeing ) the actual files I captured.
