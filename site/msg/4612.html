<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You might try just recording. Announce you are doing an EVP session, 
and just record, no questions, no pre-conceptions, no expectations. I 
do spur of the moment sessions, and almost never ask questions, I 
also don&#x27;t do investigations. &quot;They&quot; know what you need, and will 
deliver it if given a chance.

&gt; Hello, Robin!
&gt;   I&#x27;m taking a couple of weeks off from recording, but I&#x27;m rather 
new, too, to what I think of as &quot;ritualized EVP&quot; as differentiated 
from &quot;random EVP&quot;  I know that some group  members collect EVP at 
haunted locations and during ritual at-home recording sessions, but I 
don&#x27;t participate in the former anymore at all, though I did for 
almost two decades.
&gt;   I have been investigating haunted places for about twenty years 
and collecting EVP samples from such locations without much but 
negative responses.
&gt;   I met ITC leader Mark Macy in October and only then began a 
ritualized collection of EVP.
&gt;   As Mark explains it, many contemporary &quot;ghost hunters&quot; go in to 
ostensibly haunted places and attempt to communicate with the 
troubled souls present, but there is little to nothing non-sensitives 
can do to help these entities.
&gt;   Our best hope is to change the way the world thinks about the 
other side--to build a bridge of communication between our world and 
the passionate and positive minds in the next world.  In this way, we 
can work to change the mindsets of those who are trapped close to the 
earth in the next world because of  bitterness, resentment, 
negativity, etc.
&gt;   Building bridges takes time, dedication, and more time.  That&#x27;s 
why the best ITC researchers today are spending less time at haunted 
locations and more time at home, with regular experimentation 
sessions at set times each day, building up trust and vibrations with 
individuals on the other side who are also working to this end.
&gt;   I have received amazing communications during the past two 
months, but only when I am loyal to my experiments, focused on the 
good, and free of stress and negativity.
&gt;   My advice to you: don&#x27;t worry about your equipment. Don&#x27;t worry 
about where you are.  In fact, don&#x27;t worry at all.
&gt;   Feel your heart and feel the the wonder of the possibility. Be 
loyal to your recording routine, and develop your good relationships 
with other experimenters.
&gt;   Most importantly: Just believe.  Honest to God, that&#x27;s all that 
matters.  
&gt;    
&gt;   Good luck to you!
&gt;   Good luck to us all!

&gt;           Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m new to the group but probably know some of you from another 
&gt; list. I haven&#x27;t been too active in the realm of EVP recording 
&gt; recently, but have had what I consider excellent results in the 
past 
&gt; using my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 PC.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty 
&gt; overwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using. I know a 
&gt; little about using good headphones and denoiser programs, but 
beyond 
&gt; that I&#x27;m electronically challenged. Still, I wonder if there are 
&gt; simple techniques I can experiment with to increase my success. I 
&gt; think I&#x27;m a little bored.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#x27;ve been communicating with a very 
&gt; small number of entities, and I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s due to the 
&gt; limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs have always 
been 
&gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside on the hill and 
&gt; near the barn. I&#x27;ve gotten two inside my house (after inviting 
&gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative messages. 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking about getting another DVR and would love to 
hear 
&gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are best. I 
would 
&gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities eventually, but 
&gt; unfortunately don&#x27;t have the brain for building anything myself.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; Robin
