When i first joined this group in 2007, it was the only group dedicated to this and it was a rockin&#39; forum.  \n\nWe used to get between 1500 to 2000 posts a month, now it gets like 15 to 20 posts a month.  Not sure what happened here.  If each member here posted twice a month, it would be like 1800 posts.\n\nI&#39;m sure that somebody has to have something to say.\n\n-Steve\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;athena97531&quot; &lt;athenamarmalade@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe I should post here - it is hard to get any feedback for my files on two other forums.
