<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey guys -I sent a message that apparently got lost in the
stratosphere but I sent this clip because I asked about the radio as a
portal thing back in early March and I got a fairly definite
affirmative answer on that.  But who knows.  I have have given
completely opposing views before but it is something to chew on.
