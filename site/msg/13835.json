Asking for a specific, p=\r\nredetermined number is not subjective.  It is about as objective as you can=\r\n get. \n\n        I am not trying to prove anything, or rule out any possibil=\r\nities.  I am suggesting a method to determine, statistically, how accurate =\r\nsomeone=E2=80=99s board, or methodology, might be.  Lets say I select two p=\r\neople, and in separate rooms, I give each a spelling test.  Person 1 gets 1=\r\n00% right.  Person 2 gets 50% right.  Now, if I later give them a second sp=\r\nelling test, I can start with the theory that Person 1 will get near 100% c=\r\norrect, and Person 2 will get near 50% correct.  This doesn=E2=80=99t mean =\r\nthey will, or that they have gotten these scores in the past.  But statisti=\r\ncally, it is a reasonable assumption at this point.  After the second test,=\r\n I can examine the deviation of the results from the first test, and update=\r\n the statistics.   If the deviation remains small (if the results remain si=\r\nmilar), then I can more and more safely assume that person 1 will have a ve=\r\nry high chance of getting a word right, and person 2 will have half that.  =\r\nIf the deviation swings wildly, than my statistics may not be very predicti=\r\nve after all.\n\n        The same is true with the board.  As you said, getti=\r\nng this number wrong doesn=E2=80=99t say past answers were wrong, or that f=\r\nuture answers will be wrong.  And it is possible it could have been right b=\r\ny mere chance (though very unlikely: winning the lottery is more likely tha=\r\nn guessing one number out of a billion).  What we=E2=80=99d have is one sin=\r\ngle objective data point.  It gives a starting point for reasonable assumpt=\r\nions.  As you noted, after more such tests, those assumptions may start cha=\r\nnging.  It would be interesting to see how they change, if they do.\n\n      =\r\n  Different people seem to have different feelings about the board.  Some b=\r\nelieve it gives great results.  Some are suspicious, even dubious.  And the=\r\nre are plenty of opinions in between.  My test is not for those who believe=\r\n it is statistically likely that psychic tampering would occur, or that the=\r\n board=E2=80=99s performance is just not testable, which is the camp I gath=\r\ner you are in.  My test is only good for that segment of this population wh=\r\no believes or wonders if the board is capable of giving a straight objectiv=\r\ne answer to a straight objective questions, and that such performance is te=\r\nstable.  To address one of your examples, while it cannot show that an enti=\r\nty is reading my mind if it gets the numbers right, it can conversely show =\r\nthat an actual entity is not reading my mind (or that it is not performing =\r\nremote viewing, or that it is not predicting the future of what the right a=\r\nnswer is when it is revealed, or that it is not being forthright in its ans=\r\nwers) if it cannot get the numbers right in the first place.  But if these =\r\nthings are true, then it begs the question of its accuracy anyway.\n\n       =\r\n So again, this is one data point, in what could be a number of tests, for =\r\nthose who are not ruling out that testing is possible, and even desirable, =\r\nwhen believing, or acting on, information gathered by using this kind of bo=\r\nard.  \n\n\n        --- On Wed, 4/15/09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombieg=\r\nhostresearch.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercro=\r\nmbieghostresearch.com&gt;\n          Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: An alternative =\r\nto the usual ghost hunter stuff.\n          To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n    =\r\n      Date: Wednesday, April 15, 2009, 2:45 PM\n\n\n\n          It&#39;s not that I=\r\n don&#39;t want to test it, it is that I can&#39;t.

It is too subjective and therefore ca=\r\nnnot stand as a measurement for other tests of this nature by itself.\n\n    =\r\n      If it failed to get your number, that would not mean that it couldn&#39;t=\r\n get someone else&#39;s number or that someone else couldn&#39;t influence it.

Then, if it scored correct higher then mere cha=\r\nnce, only then could you say that the board can be psychically tampered wit=\r\nh. Still, that is the only thing you could say for certain. That would not =\r\nrule out the possibility that spirits can communicate through it.\n\n        =\r\n   So we would be left with more questions.

Asking for a specific, predetermined number \n        =\r\nis not subjective.&nbsp; It is about as objective as you can get. \n        =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am not trying to prove anything, or rule out any \n        possibi=\r\nlities.&nbsp; I am suggesting a method to determine, \n        statistically=\r\n, how accurate someone=E2=80=99s board, or methodology, might \n        be.&=\r\nnbsp; Lets say I select two people, and in separate rooms, I give \n        =\r\neach a spelling test.&nbsp; Person 1 gets 100% right.&nbsp; Person 2 \n     =\r\n   gets 50% right.&nbsp; Now, if I later give them a second spelling test, =\r\n\n        I can start with the theory that Person 1 will get near 100% corre=\r\nct, \n        and Person 2 will get near 50% correct.&nbsp; This doesn=E2=80=\r\n=99t mean they \n        will, or that they have gotten these scores in the =\r\npast.&nbsp; But \n        statistically, it is a reasonable assumption at th=\r\nis point.&nbsp; After \n        the second test, I can examine the deviation=\r\n of the results from the \n        first test, and update the statistics.&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; If the deviation \n        remains small (if the results remain si=\r\nmilar), then I can more and more \n        safely assume that person 1 will =\r\nhave a very high chance of getting a \n        word right, and person 2 will=\r\n have half that.&nbsp; If the deviation \n        swings wildly, than my sta=\r\ntistics may not be very predictive after \n        all.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The same is t=\r\nrue with the board.&nbsp; As you said, getting \n        this number wrong d=\r\noesn=E2=80=99t say past answers were wrong, or that future \n        answers=\r\n will be wrong.&nbsp; And it is possible it could have been right \n        =\r\nby mere chance (though very unlikely: winning the lottery is more likely \n =\r\n       than guessing one number out of a billion).&nbsp; What we=E2=80=99d =\r\nhave is one \n        single objective data point.&nbsp; It gives a starting=\r\n point for \n        reasonable assumptions.&nbsp; As you noted, after more =\r\nsuch tests, those \n        assumptions may start changing.&nbsp; It would b=\r\ne interesting to see how \n        they change, if they do.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Different=\r\n people seem to have different \n        feelings about the board.&nbsp; Som=\r\ne believe it gives great \n        results.&nbsp; Some are suspicious, even =\r\ndubious.&nbsp; And there are \n        plenty of opinions in between.&nbsp; =\r\nMy test is not for those who \n        believe it is statistically likely th=\r\nat psychic tampering would occur, \n        or that the board=E2=80=99s perf=\r\normance is just not testable, which is the camp \n        I gather you are i=\r\nn.&nbsp; My test is only good for that segment of this \n        population =\r\nwho believes or wonders if the board is capable of giving a \n        straig=\r\nht objective answer to a straight objective questions, and that \n        su=\r\nch performance is testable.&nbsp; To address one of your examples, \n       =\r\n while it cannot show that an entity is reading my mind if it gets the \n   =\r\n     numbers right, it can conversely show that an actual entity is not \n  =\r\n      reading my mind (or that it is not performing remote viewing, or that=\r\n it \n        is not predicting the future of what the right answer is when =\r\nit is \n        revealed, or that it is not being forthright in its answers)=\r\n if it \n        cannot get the numbers right in the first place.&nbsp; But =\r\nif these \n        things are true, then it begs the question of its accurac=\r\ny \n        anyway.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So again, this is one data point, in what could b=\r\ne a \n        number of tests, for those who are not ruling out that testing=\r\n is \n        possible, and even desirable, when believing, or acting on, in=\r\nformation \n        gathered by using this kind of board.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n--- On &lt;B&gt;Wed, \n        4/15/09, April Abercrombie \n        &lt;I&gt;&lt;april@ab=\r\nercrombiegh&lt;WBR&gt;ostresearch.&lt;WBR&gt;com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; \n        wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n      =\r\n  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: \n  =\r\n        April Abercrombie \n          &lt;april@abercrombiegh&lt;WBR&gt;ostresearc=\r\nh.&lt;WBR&gt;com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: \n          [EVP-ITC] Re: An alternative to t=\r\nhe usual ghost hunter stuff.&lt;BR&gt;To: \n          EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Date: Wednesday, April 15, 2009, 2:45 \n          PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n          &lt;=\r\nDIV id=3Dyiv1815592389&gt;\n          &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n          &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n  =\r\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want =\r\nto test \n          it,&nbsp;it is that I can&#39;t.
