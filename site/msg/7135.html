Ann, I'm seeing this post two weeks after it was sent but wanted to thank y=
ou for the pep talk.  I need it!  The DVD remote makes me cry too..  I just=
 can't understand why everything has to be so complicated and why my kids a=
nd husband don't have the problems I have.  I've been carrying my two hacke=
d radios and digital recorder everywhere with me but have not sat down to s=
eriously attempt a session yet.  I work three days a week out of state and =
tonight am planning to camp out in my car in a remote place so I can really=
 be alone with the equipment.  Do you think it would help for me to send ou=
t verbal or mental messages that I'm hoping to make contact but don't know =
where I'll be yet?  

Robin

      Robin,

      I uploa=
ded some of my recordings that indicate a bigger picture.

      Some of th=
e messages say there are "many spirits here," spirit rescue 
      is "very=
 important," etc. You can go through them under LC's folder.

      Last Fr=
iday, I recorded with respect to 2008, "psychic event" 
      and "universa=
l shift." That would indicate that there is a bigger 
      thing going dow=
n, in my opinion. However, I also acknowledge that 
      people here may h=
ave different callings/messages/uses other than what 
      I am hearing. I=
 am going to just follow where the path before me 
      leads and try to f=
ind my role in it.

      Personally, I think this needs to be in many peop=
le's hands. That's 
      an interest of mine, too. Not sure yet how it wil=
l happen, but the 
      radio hacks are a nice start.
