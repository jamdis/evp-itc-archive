<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was looking for some practice on investigating so I found an old small
cemetery. It is a couple hundred yards from the state&#x27;s largest supplier of
crushed limestone for the last 100 years. The grass was mowed but that was
the extent of the upkeep. Many tombstones were broken and tossed to the
outside edge of the cemetery. Many children were buried there. The oldest
tombstone we found was1815. It was 60 degrees the whole time were there. We
were sooo cold and we could easily see our breath. I&#x27;ve never heard of any
paranormal experiences regarding here and we&#x27;ve decided to keep
it anonymous  in an attempt to preserve what is left. The photos are kind of
&quot;iffy&quot; I might be seeing things where there isn&#x27;t anything. I&#x27;d appreciate
any feedback.
