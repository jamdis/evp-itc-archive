A  co worker that works with me in the tech support dept. , and he doesn&#39;t  believe me either.  I will play some files for him, and some of them he can hear, but most he doesn&#39;t.  My girl sometimes wants me to show some friends a box session and I don&#39;t like doing session with anybody else,  because they don&#39;t understand what we are doing this for, and they and think its all radio fragment anyway.  Which some are, but me and her can tell what is not.  I will only do a session with my girl.  Most people  think I&#39;m crazy trying to speak to the dead.  The only people that supports my box research is my fi&#39;ance, our group, and my Mama.  Mama doesn&#39;t understand but she will always stand by my side on any venture I do.  My Mama is a Saint in my eyes, and does nothing wrong.  I might be 30, but in my moms eyes I still the baby boy, and I&#39;m proud to be a mama&#39;s boy.  Y&#39;all have a great Sunday afternoon.\n   \n  Later\n   \n  Rees\n   \n  \nl Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@...&gt; wrote:\n            To add to that.\n   \n  Kay, since starting box research this past January, 2008, I have had one close friend already tell me the responses are nothing but CB or two way radio traffic, and another close friend who is devout Catholic said that I am speaking to the devil. Go figure. \n   \n  My wife listened to the recordings and says she can not hear the responses.\n   \n  I no longer discuss box research outside the EVP/Paranormal friendships I have.\n   \n  Its just like UFO&#39;s. Some people believe they exist and others believe they are military test vehicles.\n   \n  For the past week and a half, I have been assisting Juli in a missing person case, and have been doing the box recordings for her. I conected with the boy right away who has been missing for over a year, and the info he has given us is info only the police detectives know, as it has not been released to the press. The boy has answered every question posed to him.\n   \n  Either you believe in spirit contact or you do not. Some people believe in God and others do not. \n   \n  It seems to me the people that do not believe in spirit contact whether through a medium, box devices or personal experiences, are those that have never had an experience.\n   \n  I have had a handful since my youth and adult life, and from the first one I had, I was hooked and never looked back.\n   \n   \n   \n  Mike Edwards\n\nWiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n        Well said Margaret\n   \n  Rees\n\nitcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; wrote:\n      Hi Kay.
