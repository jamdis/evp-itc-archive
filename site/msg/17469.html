Do you think that helps discovery?

Keep throwing r=

 so much and accuse others of.

I am not here to hurt you, and if my questi=

 is a religion, something that is faith based, above question, then I am so=
rry.=C2=A0 Best wishes and I will go away.

But if this is a Science that c=
an be controlled and studied, then we need to take a real hard look at the =
subject.=C2=A0 

Censoring people that have real questions is simply not ve=
ry proactive to your cause, even if you don't like what they have to say.
