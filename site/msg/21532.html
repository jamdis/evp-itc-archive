<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The HAARP facility is inactive and has been so since April 5, 2011. I found
out over the weekend through some of my contacts that there hasn&#x27;t even been
anyone on site for quite a while. How could they be causing any of this?

&gt; all the massive rain&quot;  David says, &quot;God won&#x27;t let them create an madrid
&gt; quake&quot;  at least i hope that&#x27;s what i understood him to say.  &quot;all haarp is
&gt; getting is the rain&quot; they have been trying to play God,&quot;  David the t. says
&gt; that if i tell you guys, &quot;they won&#x27;t believe it&quot;  but, i got a big mouth so
&gt; i have to tell you to be careful, many people have loved ones that got
&gt; killed or hurt last night.  You guys know that what&#x27;s going on in the world
&gt; is not the norm.  sure this may be spring and season for rain, but, not at
&gt; this level, somethings  a brew and it&#x27;s not coffee. sf
