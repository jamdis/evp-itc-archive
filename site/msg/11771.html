Yeah (Ron) no matter the method in the end I think its all about the tone=

peaker setup sometimes the voices tones are lost and cant hear anything, wh=

sure why some days they come in clearer than others.

As you requested here=

lear. I was discussing Otto and his "replacement" with them that week as we=
ll as running some experiments redoing a few audio/visual tests I'd done in=
 the past.

The session from the next day I was saying hello to my friends =
who have passed and asked they wish my mother a happy birthday for me that =
day. My birthday is a couple weeks away from hers so this year I guess its =
a happy birthday early (I can kinda hear early on the end of that one how a=
