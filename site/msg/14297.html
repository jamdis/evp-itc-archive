I am wondering if that "child" like voice might have in fact been my  
mother?  Although, I could not hear the tape for some reason as it did  not come 
through, and I am having problems with Gold Wave so, I can't filter out  the 
static,  I have to learn how to operate these other  kind of  recording 
software devices. My mother was born in 1927, and her voice was  really light, 
that's one thing our family has in common, the women all seem to  have the 
same type of voice, my daughter sounds, like me, my cousin sounds like  my 
daughter, my mother, grandmother, aunt, we kind of sound much the  same in 
tone and vocalization.  If I could hear that file, I would  know her voice.  
It's probably because of the ancestors, my grandmother who  was Ransom married 
a Stebbins, then 100 years before that the geneology  show's a Stebbins 
married to a Ransom, and this goes back, plus A Ward/Ransom  cross was there, 
and a Stuart/Stebbins, cross, and a Stuart/Clark, so over  the years this 
voice type or sound was kind of some how got ingrained.  I  am wondering if the 
1927 was my mom, her voice was very light, and that year was  very 
important to her, because when she was little she as a baby crawed out on a  pier, 
at a place back then called the "devils wash bowl" it was where my great,  
great grandfather, a Ransom lived in Old Misson, MI he had collie  dogs, and 
had a big male called Tasso, when mom as a baby fell in this very deep  water 
he jumped in and pulled her to shore, don't know how she managed to get  
out on that pier in the first place, but she would have drowned if not for 
that  dog.  So, September 4,1927 was/is her birth day, and in 1928  she almost 
drowned, at about 10 or 11 months old.sf

Playing acrh skeptic, what value is a voice for survival evidence if you  
don't know who it is? How do you know where it came from? Or can say beyond  
doubt that it's even "paranormal"? People have millions of these voices by  
now.
