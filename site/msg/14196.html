Yep, that's exactly what that comparison does.=A0 It compares each and ever=
y byte (all their 
bits) from file to file.=A0 If the same bytes are in bot=
h files, in the same places, they are the same.=A0 One tiny little differen=
ce, and it tells you.

You can actually tell if the bytes

everyt=

      If the audio had been resampled, you could expect less 
        byte=
s, or different bytes, but not the same number of the same 
        bytes.=
=A0 That's why comparing the bytes in both files can rule that 
        out=

                  use one that does a line-by-line compare (o=

                  of the way spaces and tabs and=
 new lines work between editors 
                  and platforms).

            =
                    information.=A0 For example, if I had a

                                the other side.

This kind of compression=
 
                                does things like looking for common patte=
rns in 
                                the file, and replacing them with a=
 token.=A0 
                                A rough example would be if it =
found "Howdy 
                                Neighbor" in a file 20 times,=
 it could replace 
                                all the occurances with =
say $HN1.=A0 And also 
                                write a little dicti=
onary in there someplace 
                                that says "$HN1=
=3DHowdy Neighbor".

When the 
                                file gets to=
 its destination it can be 
                                uncompressed, a=
nd all occurences of $HN1 are 
                                replaced wit=

d (instead of 14 characters each, it

needed 4, plus the dictionary), but lost no 
                              =
  data.

Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. 
                                =
are not lossless.=A0 Depending on the level 
                              =
  of compression, some level of data is lost, and 
                        =
        so cannot be recovered or reconstructed
