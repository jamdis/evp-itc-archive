I can hear the &quot;yes it does&quot; part. I looked up some of the\n&gt; meanings of the word \n&gt; &#39;portal&#39; and found this:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A portal in fiction is a magical or technological doorway that connects two\n&gt; distant \n&gt; locations.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I suppose in this regard the &#39;ghost boxes&#39; or radios used in sweep with the\n&gt; intent of \n&gt; communication could be considered a portal of sorts, but if that is the\n&gt; case, then wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; our digital recorders (which can be used by those in spirit to produce EVP\n&gt; even when it is \n&gt; not our intent) and televisions, camcorders, ordinary cameras, etc (used by\n&gt; those in spirit \n&gt; to show their images, again, with our without our intent) also be portals? I\n&gt; recently got an \n&gt; EVP voicemail from my next door neighbor&#39;s mother, saying her name, and when\n&gt; reversed, \n&gt; the message is &quot;I love you.&quot; So I guess we&#39;d have to toss telephones and\n&gt; computers onto \n&gt; the list as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think the truth is, those in spirit can (and do!) basically go wherever\n&gt; they want, whenever \n&gt; they choose, and do not require our permission or our technology to do so.\n&gt; The only thing \n&gt; the technology does is allow us to be aware of their presence, which in many\n&gt; cases would \n&gt; have gone by unnoticed, if not for our use of the equipment. \n&gt; \n&gt; Just my thoughts on the subject. :0)\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups &lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; .com,\n&gt; &quot;Kristin&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hey guys -I sent a message that apparently got lost in the\n&gt; &gt; stratosphere but I sent this clip because I asked about the radio as a\n&gt; &gt; portal thing back in early March and I got a fairly definite\n&gt; &gt; affirmative answer on that.
