I think  \nit says more about the medium than the soul. That&#39;s my opinion and  \nI&#39;ve had a lot of years in parapsychology to form it. I&#39;m not trying  \nto ruffle anyone&#39;s feathers. I haven&#39;t been posting here a lot for a  \nwhile, so you don&#39;t know me. Really, I am not ever disrespecting  \nanyone&#39;s opinion, just disgreeing with it. :)\n\n\nWhat you write about the Gettysburg hauntings is speculation that I  \nagree with, but I still don&#39;t see any connection to the Fish Group  \nand NDEs.\n\nAnn\n\nOn Aug 18, 2008, at 12:40 AM, threadsintyme@... wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann,\n&gt;\n&gt; While it is true that the NDE can be a positive experience, it is  \n&gt; not so for everyone. The trauma that induced the NDE is something  \n&gt; can attract entities.\n&gt;\n&gt; i am not saying that the &quot;fish people&quot; are a negative entity. Not  \n&gt; at all. They are most likely an entity who is isolated and alone.  \n&gt; They are an entity who very well may have a lower vibration that  \n&gt; can prevent them from moving towards the light. In fact, on their  \n&gt; level, there is no sense of light at all. Most of the earth bounds  \n&gt; are actually spirits who are in basically a mono-dimensional  \n&gt; universe. In a  singular dimension. Their own dimension. In fact,  \n&gt; until spiritual assistance is offered from both sides of the veil,  \n&gt; they will remain trapped. They know no dimension, nor depth,  \n&gt; height, width, breadth or even light. Some are trapped in either  \n&gt; total darkness or trapped in a form of mist or fog.\n&gt;\n&gt; You might be interested in listening to some tapes that have been  \n&gt; made of trance mediums who have assisted with their rescue.  If you  \n&gt; are, let me know and I will send you the URL.\n&gt;\n&gt; What you are referring to about Gettysburg are NOT psychic  \n&gt; impressions. Impressions is when a traumatic event took place and  \n&gt; the event will replay over and over again. in fact, in some cases,  \n&gt; the event can even be timed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Al\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I would reason that since the majority of people experience such  \n&gt; positive outcomes from an NDE--it is in the whole a positive  \n&gt; experience for almost every person who has one--it would not  \n&gt; provide the necessary negative energy for purportedly negative  \n&gt; entities to feed off. In fact, the majority of NDEers are  \n&gt; transformed in a very positive way indeed. Rarified, even. Seems  \n&gt; like an odd food choice for the Fishes.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; We don&#39;t know why we see hauntings such as at Gettysburg. We may be  \n&gt; seeing/hearing an emotionless &quot;tape recording&quot; or we may be seeing/ \n&gt; hearing humans who died there who have not moved on. Only in the  \n&gt; last case is there the possibility of negative emotions/energy. In  \n&gt; either case, we cannot compare this to the Fish Group phenomenon.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;\n&gt; On Aug 18, 2008, at 12:08 AM, threadsintyme@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It could very well be because the NDE brings with it such deep  \n&gt;&gt; emotions. Whenever you come across deep emotions you are likely  \n&gt;&gt; (but not always) to find some sort of spirit attachment which can  \n&gt;&gt; bring additional problems. Spirits often attachment themselves to  \n&gt;&gt; locations or even people who have survived deep personal traumas.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That is one reason why some people still see drill formations by  \n&gt;&gt; Union and Confederate soldiers in some of the Civil War battle  \n&gt;&gt; fields.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Al\n&gt;&gt; .\n&gt;&gt; -- Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That&#39;s a very interesting detail.
