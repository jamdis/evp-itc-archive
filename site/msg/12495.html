obviously s=
teve, you fail to remember when just a week ago i had to
apologize to you f=
or asking you a question that i had no idea you and
the other person did no=
t speak? i was only interested in the
technology and furthering itc researc=
h. but i guess that one question
came across too smug.

you said to black b=
ear that he doesn't know you he dislikes you. I
don't think that is the cas=
e at all. i still don't have a problem with
you either. all i ever wanted t=
o do is talk about the research you
were doing.

I now have 2 frank's boxes=
 (the GHOSTMAN 3 and FB#33) to do my
research. (btw.. i thanks you a bunch =
already frank.. so thank you again)

Steve, you come across as an expert is=
 all i am saying. that is why i
contacted you. "boxmaster estraordinaire" i=
s it? For you to say "who
is this guy?" and cause problems for a mutual fri=
end is absurd. so..
for you and everyone to know a little about me...

oct =
22 i turn 33 years old. I have been interested in the box
technology for a =
few years now. i have been doing paranormal
investigations for 19 years now=
 and took a 3 year break (which is when
you popped up on the scene.) Now i'=
m back and hitting it hard again
and want to be able to use the best equipm=
ent that money can't buy.

Frank doesn't even pretend to be an expert nor d=
oes he expect his name
to be mentioned every time an article is published. =
anyways.. i
probably said more than i should have already.

bear... i'm up =
for that duel.. sounds fun...lol best one wins a
"certificate of expertific=
ation" sign by the us president... lol

btw.. one rule bear... no cutting a=

one up. haha
