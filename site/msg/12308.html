<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Andy,

It doesn&#x27;t manual tune like you think, the knob is big but only goes 
a 1/4 turn to the left and right.  It scans like all the others 
though, i sold it on ebay after i hacked it.  It was more of a 
challenge than anything for me, but i didn&#x27;t need another radio.

&gt; My wife is starting to look at me funny when I pull up 
&gt; radioshack.com &#x27;cause she knows what&#x27;s coming.
&gt; 
&gt; I have seen where Steve reports that this mod is pretty difficult 
&gt; (getting to the mute wire) and, like him, I love a good challenge. 
I 
&gt; was wondering though, if anyone has used this modded radio 
regularly 
&gt; and can give opinions on it&#x27;s performance stacked up against a 12-
469 -
&gt; 470 or 20-125. Looks like a more robust design, and that tuner knob 
&gt; looks like a great candidate for manual tuning as well. Any 
thoughts?
