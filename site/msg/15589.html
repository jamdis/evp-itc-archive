&gt; I think you all did a great job and the samples you used were good examples
&gt; whether ya said what they were or not. Radio hosts tend to want their show
&gt; to run their way and for their guests to follow their planned itinerary. If
&gt; people dont like that go start your own show, do it your own way. It wasnt a
&gt; science experiment it was a talk show. With any evp method it comes down to
&gt; one simple idea, that is to try it yourself and get your own results and
&gt; prove it or disprove it for ones own self. Everyone may not agree with what
&gt; you hear but its not an ego contest (for most) for who can get the best evp
&gt; its about learning theres more out there than what is visible to the naked
&gt; eye and sharing your experience with others so that they too can try it for
&gt; themselves. There are many methods and tools for communication and anyone
&gt; who wishes to learn more can do so on their own.
&gt;
&gt; Like Debbie said you either believe it or you dont. You either want to try
&gt; for yourself or you dont. It isnt up to us to prove or disprove the validity
&gt; of it, it&#x27;s up to you the individual to come to your own conclusions for
&gt; your own tests and your own experiements. There are people who run around
&gt; all day yelling I saw a UFO but until you see one for yourself you may just
&gt; think they are nutcases. Even if you see one you still may not believe it.
&gt; That is your decision to make. We cant make it for you.

&gt;   Hey thanks to Steve Hultay and the rest of the team for providing many
&gt; of the files. In response to Rick, it was the desire of Frank and myself to
&gt; play the audio samples WITHOUT providing the name of the file to allow the
&gt; listener to make up their own mind. In fact, I specifically made a written
&gt; request to the radio show which was copied to Frank on this and the reasons
&gt; why. Their response was this wasn&#x27;t a blind evaluation of communication but
&gt; rather a radio show meant to introduce Frank and his pioneering work in a
&gt; personal way to the audience and allow listeners to hear swept tuned device
&gt; files. It wasn&#x27;t the proper forum for an indepth study, it was meant to be a
&gt; virtual meet and greet between Frank and the Darkness Radio listeners. -Bill

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the examples used were problematic.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You might notice they either played the EVP, then told the audience what
&gt; the they were supposed to hear, and then played it again. Or told the
&gt; audience what they were supposed to hear first. They never just played the
&gt; sound (without the leading questions), and gave the audience some time to
&gt; decide what it was saying on their own.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So while the history at the start was interesting, all the examples were,
&gt; sadly, more examples of how people can fool themselves with pareidolia, than
&gt; examples of spirit communications.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Note also, this also explains why prerecording noises, and using them
&gt; later for the source of a Q/A session, still works. It&#x27;s a tricky
&gt; explanation when trying to explain how spirits are &#x27;changing&#x27; the sounds at
&gt; session time. But it is an easy explanation that it wouldn&#x27;t matter whether
&gt; the sounds were live or recorded, if it was just people hearing what they
&gt; wanted to hear.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I realize that many people aren&#x27;t out to prove anything, and that&#x27;s fine:
&gt; but in this case, it seemed a point of the interview was to demonstrate the
&gt; efficacy of the box. In this case it would be better to either state they do
&gt; not expect their examples to be prove anything, or if they expect to
&gt; convince an audience, to use better testing of their results, and less
&gt; leading of the audience.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; imho

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with Shane. That was a great talk Frank S and Bill M.! I&#x27;d also
&gt; like to thank Steve and Kristin for sharing some of your EVP results with
&gt; them to use on the show. Those were some good examples of Frank&#x27;s box and
&gt; the sweep tuning method.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I love it when people in this group work together towards our common
&gt; goal. It&#x27;s a wonderful example of teamwork and treating this research (and
&gt; each other) with honesty and dignity, instead of some of the egotistical
&gt; lies and deciet thats being spread around out there. It helps maintain focus
&gt; and a better perspective on this subject. Great job everyone!
