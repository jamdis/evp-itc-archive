Hiya Jill. yep everyone had a busy weekend. Many out of town at the various 
 events or dealing with family and work. Some are recovering from having 
too  much fun.

A tech in reference to evp usually represents what some  others call a 
guide. A helper of sorts whether its just to get information or  to help resolve 
an issue. They often appear over and over and act as a "lead"  for the 
group of speakers.

As for how long you record personally I have  to say short is better. I 
find that spirits speak in bursts of energy and if I  record for long periods 
of time I get very little but if I record for a short  period of time they 
make much better use of that time. Also it is much easier  to analyze short 
recordings in depth.

The only time Ive recorded long  sessions is if I am in a group or circle 
and want to record whats being said  by us as well as spirit. Being out on 
investigations one might choose to  record there longer as you document your 
investigation but for straight evp  work i usually do between 30 seconds and 
3 minutes and no longer. They use the  time wisely. And the voices are much 
louder. When doing the group or circle  such as with a medium they also have 
been loud as we were but again its much  more energy in the room when doing 
those things.

Again its just my  viewpoint and others may think differently or have 
different experiences. Hope  that helps!

Misty
