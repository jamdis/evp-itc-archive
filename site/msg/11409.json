At first I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d get much of anything\nthere, as the solitary confinement area is in a basement.  But it\nproved to be the best spot on site at the reformatory.  I hope to get\nback there later this summer for more research.\n\nRosemary\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I listen to both files and they where good.

Both occurred in\n&gt; the solitary confinement area: &quot;it&#39;s dark&quot; and &quot;the box is talking.&quot; \n&gt; The speaker was a different one than I usually use, an iSymphony\n&gt; T-Speaker from Radio Shack.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Rosemary Ellen Guiley\n&gt;"}
