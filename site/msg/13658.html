I am happy that you do share your technology with the rest of us. That is w=
hat everyone in this field should be doing. However, there seems to be this=
 covetousness going on instead, along with everyone trying to discredit eve=
ryone else. For the life of me, I can't understand why this is, unless ever=
yone just wants the spotlight for themselves. They can have the spotlight, =
I don't care, that is not what I am after.

At any rate, you have to just l=
et it roll right off. I don't understand why people are doing this to you. =
If they don't get the results they expected or want, then they don't have t=
o use the machine. No need for them to trash talk or to be asses about it. =
If they are really that disgusted with it, they should do the right and pro=
fessional thing and just give it back to you. Then you could forward it on =
to someone else who may really want to study it.

            It sounds like a tricky situation, and I'm not sure what to su=

his.  I guess you have to look at the big picture and decide if it's worth =
the frustration, the stress, and the angst, especially what it does to your=
 health.  Nothing is worth throwing your health away over.  

            E=
ven dropping all this, just for a while, might also tell you if any health =
problems you are experiencing might be being aggravated by all the drama.  =
And it might have the side effect of letting all the negativity and egos ou=
t there burn themselves out, so if you do look back into things a while dow=
n the road, it could be a prettier picture then.

            Other than a =

n a full attack: creating, for  instance, good objective standards for eval=

                        Thanks Rick! You seem to have put alot of thought =
and time into that. 

                         What really bothers me is th=

           =
              I think there is good EVP evidence, and I've heard many from =
various researchers.  Trouble is, it's like talking on a phone or radio, ho=

                      That is an interesting observation. I think the core =
of the issue is that there seems to be a `sweet spot' in paranormal beliefs=
 where there is just enough science, just enough technical backing, just en=
ough paranormal claims, and just enough indefinite evidence that keeps peop=
le interested in the ghost hunting mentality

                          Evi=
dence which becomes too indefinite turns off most people. As they become mo=
re aware of sensitives who simply make claims ("I feel there is a GHOST her=
e!"), but provide no evidence other than statements, people eventually get =
bored. Similarly, people eventually grow tired of the anthropomorphism of e=
very little occurrence in a house: a creak implies a footstep, which implie=
s a person, which, if not seen, implies a ghost. But a creak does not equal=
 a footstep.

                          And while this kind of indefinite e=
vidence can lose an audience, so can evidence that is claimed to be "obviou=
sly" evident by technology. Here, the investigator is no longer making vagu=
e claims, but waving science around, like FLIR cameras, or EMF meters, and =
then making proclamations of the results. But again, people eventually see =
these are just lights and sounds from electronics, and investigators making=
 more claims. It's like the psychics again, but with visual aids.

        =
                  I think the reason EVP studies are not securing more inte=
rest, as you noted, are a little of both effects. First is the anthropomorp=
hism problem: I notice many EVP experimenters proclaim what their results s=
ound like, or name the sound file by what they've heard. But like the creak=
s, "sounds like" does not equal "is". This is then compounded by the techno=
logy backing: regardless of how valid the EVP researcher's results are, the=
 technology can seem intimidating, but the researchers often proclaim the o=
bviousness of their results. People again become turned off by it because i=
t is not obvious to them, and in the end it is just another piece of techno=
logy presenting sounds, with no obvious connection to the paranormal, excep=
t by the claims and interpretations of the presenters.

                   =
       I believe, taking these issues into account, there is a way for EVP =
studies to garner more interest. For now, the analysis coming from the rese=
archers usually seems like a claim, and it is these claims, imho, that is b=
eing classified by the public with the rest of the paranormal claims, and s=
o, it also becomes less of an interest. A new approach could be one without=
 the claims and interpretations of the investigators, one where the sounds =
are simply played and not labeled. The interpretation of the data could be =
left to the listeners. Web sites which present EVPs could be developed wher=
e people could not see others interpretations until they entered their own.=
 I think this would be such a novel approach, that it would give the public=
 a better feeling of true involvement in the research, and feel less like t=
hey are simply being exposed to the claims of others. And I think that feel=
ing of involvement is what is needed to reignited the public interest here.=

, I think you are right in that the

egativity and sensationalism in these 
                      shows is that =
it sells better.  Most people watch 
                      these shows=
 for the escape and entertainment value, like 
                      the re=
st of tv.   And these shows learn over 
                      tim=
e what loses audience (same old claims, boring results, 
                  =
    etc), and what draws them back (wild claims, overall freak 
           =
           value, and "we must protect the children!").  This is 
    =
                  all completely orthodox for tv entertainment, but does 
 =
                     lend itself to any kind of true research, or any kind =
of 
                      actual edification.<BR><BR>So I think we can expe=
ct these 
                      shows will continue to ramp these sorts of =
elements up in 
                      order to compete, and we can expect t=

         =
                 notice many EVP experimenters proclaim what their

                   results sound like, or name the sound file by what

          =
                so, it also becomes less of an interest. A new

               approach could be one without the claims and 
              =
            interpretations of the investigators, one where the 
          =
                sounds are simply played and not labeled. The

              interpretation of the data could be left to the
