<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think that is the problem I am having though Jim.  When you say &quot;work them
over till you hear them&quot;  to me I should not have to work them over till I
hear them.  Yes taking out the ambient and background noise is one thing.
But if you just keep on listening to them with different enhancements you
are bound to hear something (matrixing).  If one person is not meant to hear
it they won&#x27;t hear it (I guess I am not quite ready to believe that one
right yet).  I think you all know what I am getting at.

&gt; Well, for myself...I don&#x27;t &quot;clean&quot; them up to much because I really don&#x27;t
&gt; know HOW :) (well a little bit)Since I&#x27;ve only been at it for a couple
&gt; weeks. BUT if you can clean up something to where you can FIND what was
&gt; there to begin with &quot;you have done no harm&quot; I hear alot more than others I
&gt; guess, and I haven&#x27;t enhanced many of my evp&#x27;s.*If anyone is able to clean
&gt; them up...I DO promise you will hear what I say is correct)Pretty BOLD
&gt; statement, but if you are able to clean it up with better software (please
&gt; do for others too) I will be more than happy to &quot;listen&quot; where I made a
&gt; mistake...I can only LEARN from it :) I have done some DEEP enhancements to
&gt; a few of my evp&#x27;s...from the begining I could only hear clicks and
&gt; thumps.....but after messing with that area, eventually I would hear the
&gt; true voices (and can tell if male or female...approximate age) and
&gt; understand the mood also....these where extreamly modified, and I feel that
&gt; I could NOT have added enough &quot;simple&quot; enhancements that would ADD a
&gt; voice....full of emotion and distinct syllables :) And some just can&#x27;t hear
&gt; them for what ever reason be it equipment that is used to hear
&gt; (pc-headphones-speakers-ears) know one has the perfect match of all these
&gt; things. Check out &quot;Jim&#x27;s RR-DR60 EVP&#x27;s&quot; in the files section....work them
&gt; over till you hear them. I really can&#x27;t do much more :)--- In

&gt; &gt; Now I may be biased to the &quot;investigation&quot; way of doing things. I do
&gt; clean
&gt; &gt; up evps if I hear something and can&#x27;t make it out do to ambient noise. So
&gt; &gt; hear is my question. When do you stop cleaning up? Wouldn&#x27;t to much
&gt; &gt; enhancing &quot;taint&quot; the results? To me the more enhancing you do the less
&gt; &gt; convincing it becomes. I hope noone finds this offensive, it is not meant
&gt; &gt; to be I am just really curious. The way I look at it is that if you have
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; do so much enhancing to find anything, was there really something there
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; begin with. Are we just making ourselves believe there is something
&gt; there??
