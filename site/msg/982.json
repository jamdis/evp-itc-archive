I was dreading it, didn&#39;t really want to go through with it, but \nas usual, not as a bad as I had imagined. We did run the box for the camera, \nand &quot;they&quot; were talking, and saying names of at least some prestent. It&#39;s \nhard to catch it all  live, so I hope it comes out on the video, and DVRs, \nsince the recordings were being done from monitor speaker on the box.\n\nIt&#39;s very hard for me to accept being the focus of this kind of attention, \nbut I don&#39;t see the work stopping, so guess I best get used to it.\n\nEven my little Yorkie was fascinated, instead of being scared to death of \neverything, he seemed to be very interestd in the cameras. Usually the dogs \nbark and bark when someone strange comes in the house, none of them acted \nthay way with this crew.\n\nThen there&#39;s the phone wierdness, maybe realted? for the last couple week my \ncell would ring about 2:30AM, blockled number, and no one on the it did that \nlast night, same thing. Then at about 4a, my phone rang, then my wifes cell \nrang, then the house phone, all about a minute apart the last one, and the \nsame thing, blocked number. When it&#39;s answered, it&#39;s dead quiet.\n\n\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\ni&#39;m making a difference.���Make every IM count for the cause of your choice. \nJoin Now. \nhttp://clk.atdmt.com/MSN/go/msnnkwme0080000001msn/direct/01/?href=http://im.live.com/messenger/im/home/?source=hmtagline"}
