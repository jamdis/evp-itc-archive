This was a general statement meant for who ever was reading it who ever is =
nor 
bright enough to see that this is not something that can be explained=
=C2=A0I do not 
care about what's his name that much to lie about him ...th=
at would wasting my 
energy and once again he means nothing to me. I may be=
 "new" to this group=C2=A0I am 
not to the others. 


I'm sure when talking=
 about something you have made a general statement...I 
didn't say so and s=
o said...when I SAID he wanted to debate what=C2=A0I said 
regarding he did=
 not have any paranormal happen while using the box I even 
mention this tw=
ice. This why I felt he did not feel there was anything going on 
with it. =
So please don't try accuse me of something stupid I'm a grown ass women 
an=
d belive me if I say something accusing you. YOU WILL KNOW IT...You mean 
n=
othing to me and I can say how I feel...last time I checked my father name =
was 
Cecil Rosa.

=C2=A0 
It does look to me li=
ke others are misunderstanding what Rasterer is saying. 
This is a big prob=
lem with e-mail. I've never seen him state that the boxes 
don't work.

I t=
hink it's rather admirable if someone has=C2=A0seen no evidence of themselv=
es over 
a considerable amount of time, yet keeps looking. Is that the case=
 here? 


After a while, most people start to get discouraged. I have been =
in places where 
others recorded EVP sessions and got some EVP, and my reco=
rder a mere inches 
away didn't get anything.=C2=A0Then there are times whe=
n I get dozens of them and 
others get nothing. As I just noted in a previo=
us post, there's an awful lot we 
don't know here. My suspicion based on th=
e above is that whatever is producing 
the=C2=A0EVP can be highly selective=
.=C2=A0But I don't know that for sure.
