Hi,

I'm generally in lurk mode due to some of=
fline priorities that  need my 
immediate attention. I'll probably be fairl=
y silent through mid-July,  but I 
had to speak up when this email crossed =
my desk.

While I don't  share Snowfire's views in most cases, I've always =
enjoyed 
the links &  banter. The recordings are always interesting... and =
isn't that 
the focus of  this group?

I'm not thrilled with ultimatums, as=
 if the group isn't big  enough (or 
big-hearted enough) to include diverse=
 views, respectfully  shared.

My two cents: Snowfire, please don't leave!
=

In  haste,
Fiona
