That is an interesting observation. I think the core of the issue is that=
 there seems to be a `sweet spot' in paranormal beliefs where there is just=
 enough science, just enough technical backing, just enough paranormal clai=
ms, and just enough indefinite evidence that keeps people interested in the=
 ghost hunting mentality


Evidence which becomes too indefinite turns off =
most people. As they become more aware of sensitives who simply make claims=
 ("I feel there is a GHOST here!"), but provide no evidence other than stat=
ements, people eventually get bored. Similarly, people eventually grow tire=
d of the anthropomorphism of every little occurrence in a house: a creak im=
plies a footstep, which implies a person, which, if not seen, implies a gho=
st. But a creak does not equal a footstep.


And while this kind of indefin=
ite evidence can lose an audience, so can evidence that is claimed to be "o=
bviously" evident by technology. Here, the investigator is no longer making=
 vague claims, but waving science around, like FLIR cameras, or EMF meters,=
 and then making proclamations of the results. But again, people eventually=
 see these are just lights and sounds from electronics, and investigators m=
aking more claims. It's like the psychics again, but with visual aids.


I =
think the reason EVP studies are not securing more interest, as you noted, =
are a little of both effects. First is the anthropomorphism problem: I noti=
ce many EVP experimenters proclaim what their results sound like, or name t=
he sound file by what they've heard. But like the creaks, "sounds like" doe=
s not equal "is". This is then compounded by the technology backing: regard=
less of how valid the EVP researcher's results are, the technology can seem=
 intimidating, but the researchers often proclaim the obviousness of their =
results. People again become turned off by it because it is not obvious to =
them, and in the end it is just another piece of technology presenting soun=
ds, with no obvious connection to the paranormal, except by the claims and =
interpretations of the presenters.


I believe, taking these issues into ac=
count, there is a way for EVP studies to garner more interest. For now, the=
 analysis coming from the researchers usually seems like a claim, and it is=
 these claims, imho, that is being classified by the public with the rest o=
f the paranormal claims, and so, it also becomes less of an interest. A new=
 approach could be one without the claims and interpretations of the invest=
igators, one where the sounds are simply played and not labeled. The interp=
retation of the data could be left to the listeners. Web sites which presen=
t EVPs could be developed where people could not see others interpretations=
 until they entered their own. I think this would be such a novel approach,=
 that it would give the public a better feeling of true involvement in the =
research, and feel less like they are simply being exposed to the claims of=
 others. And I think that feeling of involvement is what is needed to reign=
ited the public interest
 here.
