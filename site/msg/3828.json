Does Frank have his &quot;Franks Box&quot;  \n&gt; Patented by the U.S. Patent Offices (the cost is low for this,  \n&gt; BTW)???? I think it has merit thus far, for Frank to consider a  \n&gt; Lawsuit! So what if it was a gift, Frank stated it was to be used  \n&gt; in 1 place (statonary) & for testing purposes ONLY. What Chris has  \n&gt; done with it, is Run with it making several businesses with it and  \n&gt; making a profit from it . . . . this is NOT what Frank intended HIS  \n&gt; Box(es) to be used as! =Judy=\n&gt;\n\nThere is nothing to stop Frank from trying to patent it, if he so  \nchooses. But it&#39;s his choice.\n\nNeither I, nor you, know the details that passed between Chris and  \nFrank. Only they could testify to it. It would be a case of he/he  \nsaid. And what good would it serve anyone? We&#39;re back to the bull  \ncrap of the Edison v. Tesla Gangs.\n\nThis line of conversation needs to ends, HMO.\n\nAnn"}
