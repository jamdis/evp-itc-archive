<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>A bomb in the upper atmosphere would cover a very wide range. It would also
not go unnoticed.

I have seen speculation of testing of an electromagnetic weapon such as the
millimeter-wave devices talked about a year or so ago in various places.
These would be aimed at a specific target area that would not be too big. It
would not be noticed by anyone.

&gt;  That&#x27;s what David the tech says happened, also there is more oil coming to

&gt;  That&#x27;s possible. And what if someone had set off a bomb in the upper
&gt; atmosphere causing this problem? That&#x27;s one of the theories floating around
&gt; out there on the web. Between the birds, the fish, and the crabs, I don&#x27;t
&gt; know what to think of it all, but your message could have been about that.
