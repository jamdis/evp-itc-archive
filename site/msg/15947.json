Anyone know what he&#39;s talking about? He&#39;s an Electronic Audio guy.  He also has some electronic Fire truck, etc., I believe he said, radios for sale, I&#39;m wondering IF they could work by being modified by someone here (i.e. Frank)?  They&#39;re having an Audio convention in Denver Oct. 3-5, I think it is!  Just chiming in!  =Judy="}
