This is my second post since joining the group\n  on March 1.\n   \n  I came here specifically to listen and learn from Frank Sumption and to likeminded individuals.  I am a ham radio operator,\n  although I have not been active in years since the CB&#39;ers kind of took over with their new no-code rules, and am a \n  computer technician.

I look forward to your posts; and I read all of them.\n   \n  I read all the posts, even by the guy with the gall to ask for someone to send him a radio.  Yes, I would give anything\n  to have one; but I would not dare ask someone to do that for me.  That&#39;s just wrong!  And as far as threatening\n  personal emails, what the Hell has been the matter with people?  My wife is the business manager of a local \n  psychiatric practice.  The day of the full moon, they had more patients and admitted more people to the psychiatric\n  wing of the hospital than ever!\n   \n  This is off-topic.  I have been dealing with a personal problem for the past several weeks.  I had a chest X-ray; and\n  on it they found a 2.5 cm nodule in one of my lungs.  My catscan is May 8th to make sure I do not have lung cancer.\n  The waiting is killing me.  It&#39;s like being on death row and waiting to see if the phone rings.
