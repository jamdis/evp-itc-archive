<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, since i start using the Radio Shack radios i have been getting 
full sentence conversations with them.  I&#x27;ve been trying to contact 
my ex-girlfriend that passed last year at 29.  That does sound like 
her voice, she has been coming through since Sunday night and i 
actually heard them through the radio telling her to talk and she 
said &quot;Hi Steve&quot;.  They were like training her to use the radio, 
pretty weird stuff but it was good to hear from her in her own 
voice.  The response time is remarkable with these radios, they seem 
to answer right away very &quot;frank&#x27;s box&quot;-like.  These will keep me 
occupied while i wait for #27---the #13 replacement.  I&#x27;m really 
excited about that one, it may be the one to live up to for all 
future boxes.  I&#x27;m sure Frank could buy a radio shack box and add a 
sound chamber, that would probably really enhance the voices.  These 
other boxes and radios are great, but there&#x27;s only one Frank&#x27;s Box 
for all others to try to live up to.  I don&#x27;t think a 10 Minute mod 
on a $25 dollar radio will ever replace the time and effort frank 
puts into his boxes.  But anybody can try these radios and that&#x27;s 
what is important, but without Frank there would have been no 
advancement in ITC.  Someone had to break the ground work.

&gt; Steve this one is shockingly responsive. Is the voice 
recognizable? -Bill
