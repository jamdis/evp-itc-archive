Thanks to everyone who participated in Experiment 2.

=


On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor, ri=
ght in front of me, and left it there until noon Denver time on Monday, 7/1=
9/2010. This experiment asked for participants to determine what that objec=
t was. Vague or partial answers would not be counted (for example, just giv=
ing a color, shape, size, what it's made of, etc): we're looking for what i=
t is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won't count. Par=
ticipants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means they=
 chose. 


 

In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at=
 the start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder)=
 of this group. The idea with this file is that you could download it at th=
e beginning of the experiment and 'keep it safe' on your computer. Then at =
the end of the experiment, I would post the password so you can reveal the =
contents of the file. That way, you were in control of the original image d=
uring the entire time, not me. 


 

Passworded pdf: http://tech. groups.ya=
hoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ20100716. pdf



The password for that =
file is: 2plus2isFour

 Instructions, if you need them for the other files,=
 are also in that RJ folder.



So to the results:



Number of participant=
s: 6

Total tries: 29

Ambiguous answers: 0

Correct answers: 0



Object: =
Chair

 Object picture: http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files=
/ RJ/RJ20100716. jpg



As a little side experiment, on Monday I also asked=
 if anyone had gotten any answers that might indicate an article of clothin=
g (though I did not say why I was asking). One theory is that the human ope=
rator can be influenced by things they already know or suspect, and so inte=
rpret audio with their own personal 'educated guesses', that would differ f=
rom what they would hear had they not known those things. This side experim=
ent did indicate some support for that theory, since before I mentioned 'ar=
ticles of clothing', no one included an article of clothing in their result=
s. But after I mentioned it, several reports of clothing began to appear. I=
 did not add these tries to the results above.


 

If anyone has any obser=
vations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let me know. Again, thanks to =
everyone who participated in this experiment.
