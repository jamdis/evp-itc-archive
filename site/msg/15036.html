Tell me where the seperation on the spectrum =

that our ears read as vibration and our mind translates as sound. The waves=

Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and telemetry trans=

I=
 have a running theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodu=
lated exactly where they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne p=
rinciple. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in freque=
ncy then if you add or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or a=
lternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz an=
d you have an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45=
KHz then you will have a intermediate difference=C2=A0frequency at 9KHz, we=
ll within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, bu=
t all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turning the=
m on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few i=
nches of the recorder.

We are able to reproduce this affect in not only ra=
dio with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in so=
me passive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by =
Dr. Joseph Pompeii.

icrophones at the camera sites conected to the central location. I wonder w=
hat we might have heard if we did?</DIV>
