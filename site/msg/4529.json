Today I designed and added an Ion Detector.  If you&#39;d like \nto see how &quot;busy&quot; it now is, via my detailed breakout, go here: \nhttp://www.ufogeek.com/?p=169\nMy next addition has got to be raw audio generation.  I will not rest \nuntil I have this component!!!  The white noise is lonely for some raw \naudio...\n\nAll... have a safe and Happy Holiday!!!\n- Mike"}
