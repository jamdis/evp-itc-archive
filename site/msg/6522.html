I should add because I see I wasnt clear on it, the other show was part of Jason and Grant's Beyond Reality TAPS radio show.  hehehe
   
  Oh and I will try and listen to the replay when they post it in podcasts! Hopefully you can grab a copy for us!

            Cool Mike. Maybe you can break thru the skepticism surrounding modern day evp methods. They did a show on the subject before and were none too receptive to the idea. Well let me rephrase that...one was open to possibility it "might" exist, other thought there was no way evp is coming thru a radio...its just radio fragments. I find this happens alot on many different forums.
   
  Sometimes even the most openminded are closed to new ideas of change in regards to what they think they know is true. 
   
  Invite them to try it or even just try manual sweep tuning at a quick rate when they arent on air. I have had wonderful results with that including live feedback when I heard a name mentioned (I now recognize LOL) during a session while Frank R was working on his laser setup. Attaching a few samples below.
   
  Good luck!

I guess they are very popular and have had over 50000 downloads of their shows since they started in June.
