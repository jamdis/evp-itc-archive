<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t think Ghost Box research wants anything to do with Science, i wish they would just leave us alone.  Don&#x27;t they have anything better to do?

Scientists remind me of the guys on the side of the road.  One guy is working and the rest are hanging out drinking coffee telling the guy what to do......Hey, that&#x27;s a great analogy !!!

&gt; Is this not a scientific feild? Especially a young one? From read these emails it seems all this is, is a lot of he/she said crap. The matter remains (regardless of beliefs) these boxes hold no concrete proof of paranormal. Just because one or two things happen doesnt make it indefinetly perfect. I mean i have faith in them but science teaches us to go over things with a fine tooth comb and you cant with these. That is the point, regardless of beliefs minimal evidence.

&gt; &gt;  Have an idea, we will go to bat for you and Frank, Steve, don&#x27;t be afraid, at least talk to an attorney, they won&#x27;t charge you a thing at least for a first consultation, let them know, you and Frank have witnesses, this will damage your reps. Curtis is right this could hang on the net for many years what they said, I have sites from years ago, for my paralegal business from 10 years ago, i have no idea how to even take the thing down anymore, I would go for it, Steve, don&#x27;t even talk to them, the lawyer will tell you not to have any conversation with those people, otherwise it could jeopardize when you go to court. sf

&gt; &gt;                                              Also, if you listen to that podcast you will hear some very specific protocols that these science minded folks display.  Like giggling like school girls while attacking a person that neither of them know.  And, my favorite in the show:
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  Dr Rorke calling me a douce bag at around 20 minutes in.  This is who is representing the field of scientific research.

&gt; &gt;  &gt;  That&#x27;s the rub, a cure for cancer would put many thousands out of
&gt; &gt;  &gt; work--there will be no cure, too much $$$ in research and toxic treatments
&gt; &gt;  &gt; that kill more than the desease. Science in this county is a joke! You can
&gt; &gt;  &gt; fund a study to verify whatever results you are willing to pay for.

&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; Been thinking and decided that we are not wrong in our beliefs.  If we can
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; help find a missing child as so many do with $30 shack hacks, than where is
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; the harm and the threat.
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; Science spends billions of dollars each and every year to find a cure for
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; cancer with no results.  I&#x27;m talking about a $30 radio that may help and
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; has.  Seems like we have the upper hand in the matter.  Just because our
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; methods are not accepted as the norm, does that mean that it serves no
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; purp.s..
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; If society spent billions of dollars on ghost box research every year, we
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; wouldn&#x27;t even be having a conversation.
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; p.s.---- Modern science has found a cure for cancer, they just can&#x27;t reveal
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; it because they are making a fortune off of treatments.
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; p.s.s.----Thanx RJ for p.s.ing that link for that show.....Why are you here
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; anyway?
