I watched some of Most Haunted Live Gettysburg last night they were using a Minibox. You really couldnt hear the answers live but they repeated what was being said. It was pretty cool. At least the people using the mini box were amazed!

Hi April,

Cool news!  I'll make sure to tune in.  It's always good when the 
sweeping band boxes get in the news or on the TV and radio.

Is this the prototype that sweeps the AM, and a bit above and below 
that band?
