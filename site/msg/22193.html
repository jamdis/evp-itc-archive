<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wait a minute, it&#x27;s been my eperience, when radnom is working, it has no adavntage, and even does not work as well as linear or even manual sweep, and yet here I am, trying to get it to work, Screw that! 

 Ya know wgat, there ain&#x27;t no fraking patents on any of this crap, but I bet that changes as the &quot;experts&quot; believe they can go down in  paranormal history. Y&#x27;all can have it, meeza done! Then  you can beat your other friends up and rip each other off for perceived greatness. Have fun explaining that to God when you are called before him--next year.  

 I expected things to get really insane as we entered 2012, that &quot;prediction&quot; is proving to be correct, as one time friends turn on me and rip my heart out over an over.  

 Alot of hurt feeling, and offended people over the years.. pulling the plug!
