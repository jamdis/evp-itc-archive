Hi Christine, while I have yet to get a box, or have even figured out how to get one, may I ask you a question? On occasion at night I hear someone shouting my name " Mike!"  But that is it. I either hear the voice with my mind or my ear. Have yet to figure that out yet. You note that you can see spirits, but can you hear them?  I often wonder if this Jon Edwards guy or George Andersen are really speaking to spirits as they seem to be fishing in a reading, and if the customer pickis up on it, the reader says, "yes that is what they are tellling me".  I would think if spirits spoke to you, that you would hear them as you would hear me speaking to you.  I am new at this stufff, and have much to learn.  Any comments about the above would be helpful.  Mike Edwards  Cary, NC

I am taking psychic development, numerology, tarot, chakras,
mediumship etc.

I have seen ghosts since I was 5.

Interested in evps. I bought the radio shack radio last night and I
hacked it. I need to know what else I need to do evps and download
them into my pc.

Thank you for the help.
hugs
