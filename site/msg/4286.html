  I hope to have some more files soon. I'm sure I'll have some questions soon.
  Best wishes,

          Ursula,

Great files, i'm glad to see you are getting results right away. If 
you need anything just let me know and i'll help the best i can. It 
sure seems like you are doing just fine on your own though. Keep up 
the good work and i look forward to future posts. Joe's box is 
definetely different than other boxes out there, i know i've used 
them all. It's not as smooth running, but the answers are very loud 
and direct.
