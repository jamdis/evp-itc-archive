It's ok Frank we all know its a touchy subject for you right now. I think you are right they are all good researchers and they mean well. We all take different approaches to the work. We just have to remember we are all on the same team and not let our differences get in the way of our progress together.
   
  I look forward to hearing results from everyone. All methods, boxes, water, music, evpmaker, radio, air, laser, light...bring it on. The more the merrier and perhaps we will connect with what others are posting. 
   
  Oh and Frank... if you werent cranky sometimes, then I would wonder what did they do with the real Frank Sumption =)~

          Hi All;

I think I over reacted when I thought maybe Bill Murphy, or Rosemary Guiley 
were using the boxes inappropriately. For that I apologize.

What Rosemary was doing by "imprinting" the boxes was not in itself not 
incorrect, and may actually help the communcations, after all she has 
written several books, and is much more knowledgeable than I on things 
paranormal. Bill seems to be an honest researcher, and he is a likeable guy 
in person.

I apologize to everyone for becoming maybe too sensitive to others ideas 
about how the boxes should be used.

Frank-S
