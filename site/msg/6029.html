Sorry guy's 
 
Was just finishing up deleting my files from the files sect=
ion when
I saw this post and being an italian from brooklyn just could not =
live with myself if I didn't
respond.
 
Michelle be carefull what you say, =
if you are looking for a fraud you need look no further than the end of you=
r nose, which is where you will find the asshole of the biggest fraud in th=
e buisness.
your lord and master, need I mention the name, if you actuall t=
ook the time to shut that sewer you call a mouth and listened to my files y=
ou would realise that most of them I repeat the real time answer I hear flu=
idly.
 
If you have the balls which I think you do, tell your little buddy =
to come to jersey because as a real man I was disabled saving lives so I ca=
n not go to him or I would have been there already. instead of sucking my m=
ama's tit like your mentor.
have him come to jersey and I will accomidate h=
im in a live box session him with his me with mine and we will see who the =
fraud really is. 
 
p.s. you would think after all that mouth action your j=
aw would be tired.

You're correct Bruce, I only own a RS Hack 12-46=

ausesone of you to consider the validity of the research then that isgreat.=
 One of you were very surprised to discover that time is beingremoved from =
