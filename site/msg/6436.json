And\ndid someone not say their technician is Steven? Sometimes I feel like\nI&#39;m losing it.\n\nI ask if my technician&#39;s name is David (which is also the name of\nsomeone else&#39;s guide), which is info I got from Bruce. I hear,\n&quot;Steven.&quot;  followed by, &quot;It isn&#39;t.&quot; The I get the names &quot;Nicholson\nLawson,&quot; something I can&#39;t understand, and then &quot;Ben Wilson.&quot;\nNicholson is interesting to me because it is a family name. I&#39;m not\nsure if Nicholson Lawson is one name or it is a Nicholson and a\nLawson. For some reason, I got the feeling the name Ben Wilson was a\ncomplete name.\n\nThoughts?\n\nAnn"}
