<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t have the time and resources to mass produce this stuff. Besides, I
find what most want to use the boxes for, ghost hunting and demon chasing
very discouraging. I don&#x27;t know of anyone that uses this stuff, be it hack
boxes, or any other method to try to actually get higher level contacts. No
one just allows the entities to speak, all want to second guess something
that has more access and is in a higher state of being. Everyone wants to be
TAPS, and get the crap scared out themselves. Most hear only what they want
to hear. I don&#x27;t know what the answer is.

&gt;  Well, &quot;the box&quot; in nothing more than a radio with swept tuning--as far as
&gt; I know and have experienced, sweep across the radios tuning range, or band
&gt; generates bits of speech music and noise that the entities use to reform
&gt; into their voices, although there maybe more involved, but I don&#x27;t know how
&gt; one would test it.
&gt;
&gt;  Most of the boxes for sale out there are the hack radio boxes. Many of the
&gt; modern digital radios have a function that mutes, or quiets the radio while
&gt; tuning between stations. I&#x27;m not sure why, but unmutting the radio allows
&gt; the audio to be heard while the radio searches for the next
&gt; station--and--the radio is disallowed form locking onto a station, so it
&gt; keeps sweeping all the way to the end of the band--AM or FM, then starts
&gt; over. This creates the raw audio and &quot;they&quot; speak. The sweep can even be
&gt; done by hand, tuning a radio slowing by hand. I sue cheap radios I get at
&gt; thrift stores for this, gluing a dowel to the tuning knob to make it easier.
&gt; Then record form the speaker--open air.
&gt;
&gt;  So as long as the radio sweeps at not to fast and not too slow, it&#x27;ll
&gt; works. Some are better than others.
&gt;
&gt;  It takes some practice, and maybe even a certain allowing to hear the
&gt; ghost voices.
&gt;
&gt;  I prefer to take a tuner out of a radio, such as a clock radio and supply
&gt; an external sweep voltage. The sweep circuits are just basic op amps, and
&gt; you can buy a function generator kit to supply a triangle wave for linear
&gt; sweep. See keyportparanormal.com for more info on using this kit, and
&gt; building boxes.
&gt;
&gt;  One problem with this stuff is that it can be extremely subjective, others
&gt; may not hear what you hear, or hear it the same. I think mostly the messages
&gt; are meant for the one that receives it. We go round and round with the
&gt; skeptics and debunkers.

&gt; Ok, we&#x27;re new here hello!
&gt;
&gt; We just had a couple questions. HOW do you tell if you&#x27;re being ripped off
&gt; if you are searching online to buy a box? If you can point us in the right
&gt; direction of where to purchase a &quot;frank&#x27;s box&quot; would be deeply appreciated.
&gt; We saw that you can try and make your own but with my husband&#x27;s work
&gt; schedule and mine with 4 kids, sports etc.. the only time we get to work
&gt; with EVP&#x27;s and such is when we schedule an investigation and secure a
&gt; babysitter! LOL Not to mention my husband isn&#x27;t that technologically
&gt; inclined. That is my job... and I would be afraid that I&#x27;d have done
&gt; something incorrectly and what we were experiencing really wasn&#x27;t &quot;true&quot;.
&gt; Sorry to sound like such a newbie I&#x27;m sure!
&gt;
&gt; Thank you! Teddy
