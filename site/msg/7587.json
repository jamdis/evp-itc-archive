You just need to download it at skype.com.  Many of us are on there and can be found under our names (my is ghostchasingfool).  Once you add the people you are looking for to your contact list you are pretty much ready to go.  You can buzz us or send messages.  You can have up to 9 people at a time to actually speak across the country and listen to the various sessions.  It seems as of late, we have no set time, but just happen to yell at someone, and who is ever on we ask if they would like to participate and listen to the various boxes.  My friend Ray Jordon of UK5 Paranormal joinning last weekend and was amazed at Frank&#39;s Box and the RS Hacks.  It affords an opportunity to get the word out, and share our theories across the world even.\n   \n                The best is its free!\n   \n    Juli\n   \n              \n   \n   \n   \n  \n\nLisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n          Juli--how does a skype session work?  \n\n  Ann\n  \n    On Mar 3, 2008, at 10:23 AM, juli velazquez wrote:\n\n          \n\n  I am extremely greatful to have gotten a box and I&#39;m more than happy to share the audio as well as doing sessions with anyone if they would like to experience one of Frank&#39;s wonderful devises.  Some of the previous owners of the boxes don&#39;t seem willing to share, or feel a need to charge you for the experience.  I think this is a terrible!!!  Frank had spent many hours building this devices, and believe this was never his intention for people to keep their experience and audio to themselves or to profit in anyway.\n   \n  Therefore, anyone wanting to sit in on a session is more than welcome.  Some of us here get together via Skype free internet phone, allowing an opportunity for anyone to take part and share the experience.  Just because you don&#39;t have  FB doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t experience and take part in great communication.  Prior to me owning one, I sat in with Steve and Bruce, allowing me an opportunity to listen to their FB&#39;s (which they both have differently unique boxes) and do my own recordings.  To them I was very greatful, and I never felt left off. \n   \n  Many of us have various boxes and conduct sessions differently, this allows us additional ways to learn from each other and experience all the boxes. \n   \n  If anyone is interested, please just let me know, some of you hear already can confirm these get togethers and you walk away with a greater respect for each other and spirit communication.\n   \n  Juli\n   \n  \n\npurplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n      Yep!\n\nFS\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Joanne Tauferner &lt;tauf03@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe it was Rosemary who was on C2C in December who stated she \nhad two of your boxes.
