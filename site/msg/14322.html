I always listen to EVP's with high quality headphones.

In the "tomorrow le=
t you know" EVP, I do hear something....just can't be sure that it is a voi=
ce. I does have a cadence similar to someone speaking, but it could just as=
 easily be something present in the environment-a natural background noise.=
 There is no way for me to tell for certain as it is just too feint. I can'=
t make out any clear words. Sure-I could probably matrix some in, but that =
is all it would be.

For an EVP to be considered proof positive of spirit c=
ommunication by the community at large, it has to be clear enough that many=
 people hear the same thing, without hints or coaxing. If you have to have =
high quality devices to make it out, it just isn't good enough. That does n=
ot mean it isn't a true EVP, just that it isn't good enough to stand as evi=
dence.

As for the whistle, it sounded like feedback to me as well, but I w=
ill have to take you word for it that you were no where near any other elec=
tronics or EMF's that could contribute to feedback. Even so, if I am trying=
 to remain unbiased and objective, there is no way for me to say this is a =
spirit, without personally being with you when you caught it. The only thin=
g I can still say about it is could be, but for me it is non conclusive.

I=
f someone does not hear what you are hearing, try to remain objective and j=
ust understand that it isn't personal. You have to understand that with jus=
t these recordings alone, there is no way to scientifically prove what you =
have recorded is spirit communication. If you could get consistent, intelli=
gent question and answer recordings, then you would be alot closer.

Here a=
gain, we are back to the "So what?" thing. You don't HAVE to prove anything=
 scientifically, unless you want others to completely believe in your evide=
nce.

The theory that is being kicked around is that some EVP's are persona=
l, and only meant for the person recording them to hear. If this is the cas=
e, no matter how clear something is to you, others may not hear it.

  Okay, I can respect that. If you c=
