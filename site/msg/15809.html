&gt; Here is a little poem by Kipling,  btw I love all my lists,  Bonnie
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; _Rudyard  Kipling_ 
&gt; (http://www.everypoet.com/archive/poetry/Rudyard_Kipling/kipling_contents.htm) 
&gt; If 
&gt; 
&gt; If 
&gt; If you can keep your head when all about you 
&gt; Are losing theirs and  blaming it on you; 
&gt; If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  
&gt; But make allowance for their doubting too; 
&gt; If you can wait and not  be tired by waiting, 
&gt; Or, being lied about, don&#x27;t deal in lies, 
&gt; Or,  being hated, don&#x27;t give way to hating, 
&gt; And yet don&#x27;t look too good,  nor talk too wise;  
&gt; If you can dream - and not make dreams your master; 
&gt; If you can  think - and not make thoughts your aim; 
&gt; If you can meet with triumph  and disaster 
&gt; And treat those two imposters just the same; 
&gt; If you  can bear to hear the truth you&#x27;ve spoken 
&gt; Twisted by knaves to make a  trap for fools, 
&gt; Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,  
&gt; And stoop and build &#x27;em up with wornout tools;  
&gt; If you can make one heap of all your winnings 
&gt; And risk it on one  turn of pitch-and-toss, 
&gt; And lose, and start again at your beginnings  
&gt; And never breath a word about your loss; 
&gt; If you can force your  heart and nerve and sinew 
&gt; To serve your turn long after they are gone,  
&gt; And so hold on when there is nothing in you 
&gt; Except the Will which  says to them: &quot;Hold on&quot;;  
&gt; If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, 
&gt; Or walk with  kings - nor lose the common touch; 
&gt; If neither foes nor loving friends  can hurt you; 
&gt; If all men count with you, but none too much; 
&gt; If you  can fill the unforgiving minute 
&gt; With sixty seconds&#x27; worth of distance  run - 
&gt; Yours is the Earth and everything that&#x27;s in it, 
&gt; And - which  is more - you&#x27;ll be a Man my son!

&gt; Yep April you are right. Remaining open to the possibility is hard  enough 
&gt; for most people. Again its a case of prove or disprove it for  yourself. Not 
&gt; everyone comes to the same conclusions or gets the exact  same results. 
&gt; Maybe similar but not exact. 
&gt;  
&gt; I tend to use a variety of methods. When voices come from things  such as 
&gt; water or out of thin air sometimes its a easier for some to  believe there is 
&gt; something there that they were not aware of.
&gt; 
&gt; But again they have to prove it for themselves to be able to have  that eye 
&gt; opening moment.
&gt;  
&gt; I only comment on what I hear or dont hear. My speaker set up is a  bit 
&gt; different than most. I hate headphones. Others prefer them. Some use  pc 
&gt; speakers. Results vary based on the individual. What I hear you may  not then 
&gt; again you just might hear it exactly the same. I dont worry  about that. Just 
&gt; keep exploring with an open mind.

&gt; To be honest, I am still very  skeptical about the Frank&#x27;s Box type of 
&gt; technology, as I have not  heard anything convincing enough for me personally to 
&gt; say  yeah-that is spirit communication. But I do remain open to the  
&gt; possibility.
&gt;  
&gt; But that is my problem not anyone  else&#x27;s, and this is why I have refrained 
&gt; from commenting too much  on anyone&#x27;s results.

&gt; I think it varies depending on who you ask as well as what they  have 
&gt; personally experienced. As an example, some people believe in  angels and demons 
&gt; others do not. Therefor some may get messages that  correspond to their own 
&gt; beliefs as well as the beliefs of those who  are speaking.
&gt; 
&gt; Almost every person who does this eventually  develops a theory that may 
&gt; change over time based on what they  experience and what their beliefs are. 
&gt; Then there are those who  remain undecided or have doubts.
&gt; 
&gt; As for me I look at it as  purely educational, a learning experience. Ive 
&gt; met many people I  never knew existed. Ive researched topics I&#x27;d never even 
&gt; considered.  Ive gotten messages and images that are awe inspiring and many  
&gt; interesting concepts to ponder and explore.
&gt; 
&gt; There are many  glimpses of truth, as well as momentary proof along the way 
&gt; that  lead me to develop my own theory and eventually you will develop  
&gt; your own too. This research is fascinating and can be quite mind  blowing.
&gt; 
&gt; I dont worry what anyone else thinks. I have no need  to prove anything to 
&gt; anyone else. They can do that for themselves. I  always say honesty is the 
&gt; best policy and if you are honest with  yourself and others the only ones who 
&gt; object are those who&#x27;s lies  arent tolerated. So just look for the truth 
&gt; yourself and dont let me  or anyone else tell you what that is. 
&gt; 
&gt; It&#x27;s a great journey  and your path is your own!

&gt; &gt; Thank you, guys, but I just wanted to make  sure -- really sure. 
&gt; Sometimes it&#x27;s hard on here to figure out which  post is replying to which!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So I&#x27;ve been thinking  about this over and over -- I&#x27;ve been able to 
&gt; think of little else  in the last few days -- trying to figure this out and make 
&gt; some sort  of reasonable theory I can live with. I know we will never have 
&gt; a  true answer, at least not any time soon, but surely those who have  been 
&gt; doing this for years and years must have a working theory on  what these 
&gt; entities are? Based on their behavior rather than what  they say? Based on 
&gt; consistencies from researcher to researcher?  Based on things these entities 
&gt; know and don&#x27;t know (e.g. knew my  dad&#x27;s friend Gordy was dead, while I did  
&gt; not)?
