I also posted the an mp3\nof its first 30 seconds of life.  The boxes seem to really talk a lot\nwhen they are brand new.  They soon calm down but I have no answer for\nthis.  It is not because of the circuits or anything like that.  They\ndo not change or break in, they are always the same.  Any way check\nout the clip and let me know.  This box was built into a handy talkie\nradio case.  Its very small and a great way to do this.  It has a\nrechargeable    battery pack.\nRob\nDeadscience.com"}
