<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>WOW!! I am amazed that someonme actually tried this! It does work. There was 
a Danish(I think) researcher doing the same thing, but never could make 
contact with them. I have done this myself, and it can work wiht TV too, if 
you can switch channels fast ennough. I think you could use a steeper motor 
controler to randomly turn a stepper moter, to turn the dial. Manually 
spinning the dial has one advantage, the sound is clearer! I have yet to see 
a method of ITC that produces better results that the random tuning methods.

&gt;I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning system. I tried 
&gt;several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner through the AM band 
&gt;late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the dial moving at a constant 
&gt;rate of speed. This is not nearly as good as Frank&#x27;s &#x27;hands off&#x27; random 
&gt;tuning method but it still produced some results. What impressed me most is 
&gt;that some of the voices sound the same, even though I tuned through several 
&gt;channels. This attached capture could be a technical message.
&gt;&quot;Plug a million hertz&quot;   One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which is close 
&gt;the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.
