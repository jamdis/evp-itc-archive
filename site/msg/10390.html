Hi Rees,
 
I have done this before in fact just recently.  I did it with my  brother's 
fatherinlaw 2 days after he died.  My technician helped me out  and went and 
got this guy for me and I just about flipped when his voice  actually came over 
the radio.  Unfortunately it did not record.  It  was only meant for my ears.
 
Jeff

Hi Rees. When I record, I'll ask for them. I think your views on the  subject 
are wonderful, 
and not in the slightest disrespectful. 

I  know for me, when someone makes their transition after having lived a 
long,  full life, it 
isn't as hard for me to deal with because it's just sad,  not tragic (if that 
makes sense.) I 
hope your great aunt and uncle are  enjoying a glorious reunion! :-) 

Margaret
