Anyway I want to=\r\n address the subject of removing time from a file.The way I am understandin=\r\ng what you mean by removing time is tocut segments of the recording out of =\r\nthe file. I myself do cut out simple noise or static fragments that are nat=\r\nurally occurring in the sweep of the boxfor instance the minibox has an inh=\r\nerent hum or thump as it&#39;s Creator calls it. When I receive a response thro=\r\nugh the minibox it will go something like this &quot;yes HUM Bruce HUM we HUM ar=\r\ne HUM here HUM&quot;I will definitely remove every HUM from between the words bu=\r\nt that does not change the message or affect the words that are spoken.I&#39;m =\r\nassuming that is what you are talking about when you and babs mention &quot;remo=\r\nving time&quot;  I&#39;m just guessing but maybe babs is trying to insinuate that re=\r\nsearchers here are altering their files., If so maybe she should be looking=\r\n for that in her own back yard. There must be someone she knows for a fact =\r\nthat isaltering communications. And mike please lets not turn this into a w=\r\nhole big thing!

Let me say that you h=\r\nave many friends and associates here just for the simple fact that you have=\r\n an interest in ITC, are a researcher and a complex thinker. I think we hav=\r\ne shown in the past that we can have a disagreement and still remain friend=\r\ns. You make a lot of good points in your post and I would like to know who =\r\nremoves time from their recordings. I have never removed time from my recor=\r\ndings and see no reason why anyone else would without saying so in an accom=\r\npanied post.I have limited experience with the 12-469&#39;s as a single piece o=\r\nf equipment. I have arranged mine per Mike&#39;s, &quot;Spiricomp&quot; design. I have 3,=\r\n 12-469&#39;s feeding a four channel mixer, which goes into a laptop running DC=\r\n6 with Soundsoap 2. Mine scan equally spaced on the FM band. I have had pre=\r\ntty good results until recently.At first the messages were pretty clear but=\r\n I had a feeling I was getting a different group than I normally have for t=\r\nhe last few years. When I would ask about my friends on the other side they=\r\n would tell me they will look for them. Well about 2 weeks ago the 12-469 a=\r\nrrangement started generating a lot of interference and feedback. I started=\r\n hearing radio static voices as I use to get with shortwave. Not voice frag=\r\nments but voices made of static (metallic and robotic). They were breaking =\r\nthrough the sweeping. I had a feeling someone else was trying to force thei=\r\nr way through. Finally the interference got so bad I was forced to revert b=\r\nack to a simpler method I used before, which is using fan noise. One of the=\r\n first messages to come across was from a familiar voice telling me and I q=\r\nuote, &quot;your method sucks&quot;. I have not used the 12-469&#39;s since because of th=\r\ne clear messages I have been getting using water and fan noise. That does n=\r\not mean I have given up on the 12-469&#39;s but I won&#39;t use them again until I =\r\nam persuaded to by my friends on the otherside that they are willing to use=\r\n and adapt to it. To my knowledge only Misty, Laura and myself use water fo=\r\nr recording.Regards,Frank R.\n----- Original Message ----From: babiarz3 &lt;bab=\r\niarz3@yahoo. com&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .comSent: Monday, January 21, 2008=\r\n 9:34:01 AMSubject: [EVP-ITC] Babs has Issues!\n\nAlright, you all know I&#39;m v=\r\nocal and I haven&#39;t made any &quot;friends&quot; herebut, if we can put that aside for=\r\n a moment...Spirit communication has been my passion since day one, a littl=\r\ne over6 years ago. I am a believer in the afterlife and a believer inspirit=\r\ns attempting to communicate with us for a variety of reasons. Ihave spiritu=\r\nal beliefs that I feel strongly about and devote much ofmy waking (and slee=\r\nping) moments to thoughts about this field.However, I am also a researcher =\r\nand a skeptic. In order for me toallow ideas to become part of my reality I=\r\n must experiment. In orderfor me to believe something is paranormal I HAVE =\r\nto rule out all otherpossible causes. That being said, I have some question=\r\ns. My hope isthat there are some here willing to enter into discussion with=\r\n me.I have a difficult time with many of the files here. Many times, therei=\r\ns no question included in the file. I can not determine whether ornot the &quot;=\r\nreply&quot; is an intelligent reply. Maybe this has to do withallowable file siz=\r\ne.Some of the files I have been able to download. (I don&#39;t always keepmy em=\r\nail settings on for this group as I get too many - lol) When Ilook at the f=\r\nile I see problems. There will be complete flat linesilence between the wor=\r\nds. Many times the &quot;reply&quot; is also at the samedecibel as the question asker=\r\ns voice. Those two things should notoccur naturally considering the devices=\r\n being used. That tells me thatthere is manipulation of the files. Now, wha=\r\nt is manipulation to me,may not be manipulation to others. To me, any alter=\r\ning of the recordedfile constitutes manipulation. I do not know if the repl=\r\ny wasintelligent or manipulated to be intelligent. Some say that they simpl=\r\ny remove the &quot;no response&quot; time. I&#39;ve beentold it can be as much as 18 seco=\r\nnds removed from between words. Nowwe run into the problem of us deciding w=\r\nhat word fits in with thequestion. What words are being ignored? Did we tak=\r\ne nonsense and makesense? Did we amp every noise/word or only what fit?I th=\r\nink it&#39;s great that files are offered for peer review. However, Ithink we h=\r\nave to load them untouched or at the very least, offerexactly what was done=\r\n to the entire file. Time elapsed between words,what was amped, etc. I&#39;d al=\r\nso love to see some of these sessions videotaped with the question asker fa=\r\ncing the camera and a second handclock visible. Truly, we aren&#39;t researchin=\r\ng if we don&#39;t have someprotocol in place.Here is an issue I have with the R=\r\nS Hacks. I have the 469. It takesapproximately 18 seconds to scan through t=\r\nhe AM frequencies. Now, thetypical person would think that we can take that=\r\n 18 seconds and divideit by the number of AM stations to determine how long=\r\n we are on eachstation before moving on to the next one. In that way we cou=\r\nlddetermine what is impossible to be said via a radio fragment. However,tha=\r\nt&#39;s not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one frequency to thenext and =\r\nof course the biggest problem is that some stations arepicked up over multi=\r\nple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard on 630, 640,650, 660 and maybe even 67=\r\n0. That extends the time a great deal. Thisis a difficult problem because i=\r\nt is almost impossible for the averageperson to be able to make a determina=\r\ntion on time this way. I heard about the following today; An experimenter r=\r\necords at the sametime every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importance of m=\r\neditating,automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but what we hav=\r\ne toremember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning into the samer=\r\nadio show every day. One of my first experiments with the 469 had mehearing=\r\n this deep male voice over and over again. What was he tryingto tell me, I =\r\nwondered. Than I realized that he was speakingapproximately every 18 second=\r\ns; every time the scan hit that station.So, if you are removing up to 18 se=\r\nconds between words, then you arereally only recording the words from one s=\r\ntation. This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides discussiona=\r\nbout some research problems. I know that there are those who are notconcern=\r\ned with anything more than the communication itself but I thinkthat it is o=\r\nf the utmost importance to attempt to factor in someprotocol in order for t=\r\nhis to be considered serious research at all. \n\nLooking for last minute sho=\r\npping deals?

Many times, there&lt;BR&gt;is no question included in the file. I can not de=\r\ntermine whether or&lt;BR&gt;not the &quot;reply&quot; is an intelligent reply. Maybe this h=\r\nas to do with&lt;BR&gt;allowable file size.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some of the files I have been =\r\nable to download. (I don&#39;t always keep&lt;BR&gt;my email settings on for this gro=\r\nup as I get too many - lol) When I&lt;BR&gt;look at the file I see problems. Ther=\r\ne will be complete flat line&lt;BR&gt;silence between the words. Many times the &quot;=\r\nreply&quot; is also at the same&lt;BR&gt;decibel as the question askers voice. Those t=\r\nwo things should not&lt;BR&gt;occur naturally considering the devices being used.=\r\n That tells me that&lt;BR&gt;there is manipulation of the files. Now, what is man=\r\nipulation to me,&lt;BR&gt;may not be manipulation to others. To me, any altering =\r\nof the recorded&lt;BR&gt;file constitutes manipulation. I do not know if the repl=\r\ny was&lt;BR&gt;intelligent or manipulated to be intelligent. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some say tha=\r\nt they simply remove the &quot;no response&quot; time. I&#39;ve been&lt;BR&gt;told it can be as=\r\n much as 18 seconds removed from between words. Now&lt;BR&gt;we run into the prob=\r\nlem of us deciding what word fits in with the&lt;BR&gt;question. What words are b=\r\neing ignored? Did we take nonsense and make&lt;BR&gt;sense? Did we amp every nois=\r\ne/word or only what fit?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I think it&#39;s great that files are offered f=\r\nor peer review. However, I&lt;BR&gt;think we have to load them untouched or at th=\r\ne very least, offer&lt;BR&gt;exactly what was done to the entire file. Time elaps=\r\ned between words,&lt;BR&gt;what was amped, etc. I&#39;d also love to see some of thes=\r\ne sessions video&lt;BR&gt;taped with the question asker facing the camera and a s=\r\necond hand&lt;BR&gt;clock visible. Truly, we aren&#39;t researching if we don&#39;t have =\r\nsome&lt;BR&gt;protocol in place.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Here is an issue I have with the RS Hacks=\r\n. I have the 469. It takes&lt;BR&gt;approximately 18 seconds to scan through the =\r\nAM frequencies. Now, the&lt;BR&gt;typical person would think that we can take tha=\r\nt 18 seconds and divide&lt;BR&gt;it by the number of AM stations to determine how=\r\n long we are on each&lt;BR&gt;station before moving on to the next one. In that w=\r\nay we could&lt;BR&gt;determine what is impossible to be said via a radio fragment=\r\n. However,&lt;BR&gt;that&#39;s not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one frequenc=\r\ny to the&lt;BR&gt;next and of course the biggest problem is that some stations ar=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;picked up over multiple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard on 630, 640,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;650, 660 and maybe even 670. That extends the time a great deal. This&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;is a difficult problem because it is almost impossible for the average&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nperson to be able to make a determination on time this way. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I heard=\r\n about the following today; An experimenter records at the same&lt;BR&gt;time eve=\r\nry day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importance of meditating,&lt;BR&gt;automatic wr=\r\niting, etc at the same time every day but what we have to&lt;BR&gt;remember with =\r\nthis, is that now we are in essence tuning into the same&lt;BR&gt;radio show ever=\r\ny day. One of my first experiments with the 469 had me&lt;BR&gt;hearing this deep=\r\n male voice over and over again. What was he trying&lt;BR&gt;to tell me, I wonder=\r\ned. Than I realized that he was speaking&lt;BR&gt;approximately every 18 seconds;=\r\n every time the scan hit that station.&lt;BR&gt;So, if you are removing up to 18 =\r\nseconds between words, then you are&lt;BR&gt;really only recording the words from=\r\n one station. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besid=\r\nes discussion&lt;BR&gt;about some research problems. I know that there are those =\r\nwho are not&lt;BR&gt;concerned with anything more than the communication itself b=\r\nut I think&lt;BR&gt;that it is of the utmost importance to attempt to factor in s=\r\nome&lt;BR&gt;protocol in order for this to be considered serious research at all.=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\nLooking for=\r\n last minute shopping deals? &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.rd.yahoo.com/evt=3D51734/=\r\n*http://tools.search.yahoo.com/newsearch/category.php?category=3Dshopping&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;Find them fast with Yahoo!
