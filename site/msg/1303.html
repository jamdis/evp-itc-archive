<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>To expand upon Guy&#x27;s post, the echo chamber size can vary. Some of his
boxes have an internal chamber that&#x27;s about 2&quot; x 3.5&quot;. Some of his
boxes have chambers which are external and are a bit larger. An
external one I saw was made with a light wood frame which was wrapped
in heavy aluminum foil.

If someone is considering constructing their own FB then I suggest
considering the sweep tuning method also as the recordings I&#x27;ve heard
are impressive. We are experimenting with a RVG equipped box and are
getting good results but I am also interested in the sweep tuning
approach.

By the way, Guy and myself both be speaking at the upcoming South
Coast Paranormal Convention July 20 and 21 in Santa Paula, CA. see

&gt; Frank has provided a paper with a block diagram, MOST (but not all) 
&gt; of the schematics, brief description of operation and a few color 
&gt; pics of the internal wiring. Look in the Files section of the group 
&gt; on the Yahoo groups website for &quot;theghostbox.pdf&quot;. Unfortunately, he 
&gt; has left out some details (like size/composition of the &quot;echo 
&gt; chamber&quot;, etc.) and most of the schematics are hard to read due to 
&gt; digitizing (resolution) problems.
&gt; 
&gt; The key component that can be difficult to find is the Sanyo LA1135 
&gt; AM Tuner IC that&#x27;s at the heart of the system. Frank has apparently 
&gt; scrounged this chip from old car radios.
&gt; 
&gt; Here&#x27;s how it operates:
&gt; 
&gt; The RVG (Random Voltage Generator) output is fed to the &quot;tuning&quot; 
&gt; input of the LA1135 AM radio receiver. What this basically does is 
&gt; similar to a human being rapidly and randomly hitting the tuning 
&gt; station buttons in a car radio or varying the tuning dial of a 
&gt; stationary or portable radio. The output of this randomly-tuned AM 
&gt; radio is then fed to a small speaker into an internal &quot;echo chamber&quot; 
&gt; (although his box also provides an output jack for an external 
&gt; speaker to use an external &quot;echo chamber&quot; or even just the room) 
&gt; which also contains a small electret microphone (these are the types 
&gt; that a very tiny and can be clipped to your lapel, tie, etc.). The 
&gt; output of this mike is then fed to another speaker (or optionally to 
&gt; headphones) for the output. Where the &quot;entities&quot; interact with the 
&gt; box is in this &quot;echo chamber&quot; (probably just a small, soundproof 
&gt; plastic box) using the speech snippets from the randomly-tuned AM 
&gt; radio stations as a carrier for any EVP.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps everyone!

&gt; &gt; I have been doing evp research for a number of years now and have 
&gt; &gt; exhausted all venues so when something like this comes along of 
&gt; course 
&gt; &gt; it is a m7ust have for the serious researcher. I have been 
&gt; &gt; experimenting with the sweep method only for a few days but to me 
&gt; it is 
&gt; &gt; just another evp recording method and still needs to be edited and 
&gt; you 
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t have that real time communication.
&gt; &gt; I was disabled at 911 and have all the time in the world to 
&gt; experiment 
&gt; &gt; so I believe the box would be put to good use. can anyone steer me 
&gt; in 
&gt; &gt; the right direction as far as who to contact or how to have a box 
&gt; built?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; all help is greatly appreciated.
