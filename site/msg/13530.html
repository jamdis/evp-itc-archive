I do not have an ovilus or a puck - I was going to get one, but I participated in many sessions alternating puck, ovilus, and radio devices.

 

Although at times we would get relevant responses on the puck and ovilus, more often than not it would be confusing, irrelevant, and disjointed.


We would invariably return to the the radios and have much better results, so at this time I have decided to concentrate my efforts on radios and a couple of other methods and areas I am still researching.

 

I always encourage people to do their own research, though. If you want to, go for it!

Just let us know what happens.
The results I talked about were not meant to discourage you, just to tell you what we experienced. Maybe some people do better with the puck and ovilus. Not everyone is meant to do everything.

I personally have not used this device, but a close friend and fellow investigator just purchased one. She has used it only a few times but the results were encourageing. On her first recorded session, when asking &quot;why are you here&quot;, the reply that she recieved certainly seemed relevant. The Ovilus stated &quot; fell running down stairs, broken neck&quot;. Another interesting response from the recording was in reply to the question &quot;who are you?&quot; The response from the Ovilus was &quot;ghost&quot;. However, she also recieved responses that did not seem relevant to the questions she was asking at the time. She sends me all of her recordings for review so I will keep you posted on the results. Personally, I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on one to try it out for myself.
