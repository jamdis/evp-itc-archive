LOL well if ya werent the grumpy old man sometimes Id start to think youve been abducted by aliens and replaced with a frankenbot hehehe
   
  Gotta say I echo that idea. Many methods, and it all just depends on what works for ya at the time. I keep adding to the list of tools/methods and most of them are rather simple in nature.

          Hi All;

In my own work, I get some really amazing stuff in the recordings. 
Voices that seemingly talk as if live from a pre-recorded tape, they 
comment on what's happening around me at that moment. I get very 
frustrated when not one box user will just let the things work, 
instead it's always ask questions, and pre-judge everything. I think 
we influance what comes through more than anyone here wants to 
believe. 

Then to have people that don't know squat about how the box works, 
or anything about electronics presume to tell me how it really works--
well, I can only take just so much of that without ripping someone's 
head off. 

All these years on varous groups and forums, and it's one arguement 
after another from those that want the paranormal to behave according 
to some preconceived rules. I have a completely different approach to 
this stuff, and if it's wrong--how come it works?

As far as getting proof--I don't need it, I see, hear, and feel 
spirits from time to time, I know life goes on.

I have no idea what I'm trying to say here. I don't want that 
argumentative, this is the onlyest way crap stuff anymore. My boxes 
were not the first, or the best, it just one more method of many. 
When someone says such and such is the only way, I want to jump down 
their throat cuz that's wrong. Can't seem to keep that grumpy old man 
locked in the basement!
