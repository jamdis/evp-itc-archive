<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I like the idea a lot. Its easy to wonder about possible interaction
with the Box from anywhere. Different people receiving personal
messages simultaneously is something I&#x27;ve already observed in sessions
where you have multiple people present. It will be interesting to run
a box session on the network for a specified time and have listeners
post the messages they heard on the forum so results can be compared.

&gt; &gt;  Piece of cake! The boxes are pretty much ready, it requires only 
&gt; &gt; connecting the box line out to the sound card input, and sending 
&gt; out 
&gt; &gt; over the internet, which I have no idea how to do the soft ware 
&gt; &gt; part, but the guy that suggested seems to. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  I&#x27;m sure that people in different locations would get different 
&gt; &gt; messages although, presumalby, the box was outputing only a single 
&gt; &gt; stream of information. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  This is something to be excited about. It could be just weeks away.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thats an awesome idea. imagine though its streaming live across 
&gt; &gt; cables
&gt; &gt; &gt; throughout the states. The possibility of the audio being further
&gt; &gt; &gt; influenced is greater Im sure. Reminds me of when a radio show was
&gt; &gt; &gt; being done on evps people recording the show played it back later 
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; listen again and heard messages to them during the play back and 
&gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; was being reported from tons of people. So its pretty interesting 
&gt; &gt; if
&gt; &gt; &gt; you can actually have this done, cant wait to see what happens.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#x27;s like DAH!!! Why I not think about this!? Setup an internet 
&gt; &gt; server 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (somehow) and connect a box to the internet to run 24/7----
&gt; LIVE. 
&gt; &gt; Or
&gt; &gt; &gt; make 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coordinated short tests so remote reception can be compared to
&gt; &gt; &gt; local. It 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be an easy task to make modes and bands switchable 
&gt; &gt; remotely as
&gt; &gt; &gt; well. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What about multiple boxes?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just imagine, a box accessible to the world 24 hours a day, 
&gt; seven
&gt; &gt; &gt; days a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; week! It staggers the imagination! Given the nature of the 
&gt; &gt; voices and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contacts, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if several people could 
&gt; access 
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; system 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the exact same time, yet all receive personal communications.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Guess that would create wee ripple in the darkside!!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wasn&#x27;t sure if the originator of the idea wanted his name out
&gt; &gt; &gt; there, I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; took it off.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Hey Frank,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Its me again
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I haven&#x27;t had much time to work on ITC lately but I&#x27;m 
&gt; &gt; interested in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;taking a slightly different approach using a quantum random 
&gt; &gt; number
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;generator (unless its cost prohibitive) and computer (hoping it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;doesn&#x27;t get fried).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;But... what are your thoughts on this:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;What if we hooked up one of your boxes to the internet for 
&gt; &gt; remote
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;users to attempt interaction with?  Leaning on the non-
&gt; locality 
&gt; &gt; theory.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Couple things I&#x27;m wondering about, assuming it works:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;- Would the box work &quot;better&quot; physically present at a &quot;high 
&gt; &gt; energy&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;location?  I&#x27;m refering to locations on Earth that are known 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;high energy from lay lines, etc. &quot;portals&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;- Will the recorded audio from your box be the same recorded 
&gt; or 
&gt; &gt; heard
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;audio at the remote location?  Meaning will the EVP be 
&gt; &gt; recordable at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;your location or only the remote users location?  Or if both, 
&gt; &gt; will
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;they match?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Just some things I&#x27;ve been thinking about lately.  Curious 
&gt; what 
&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; think.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
