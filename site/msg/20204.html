Ok, i =
listened. Please do not get mad at me, i want to be honest. I heard a coupl=
e of words here and there, but nothing i could make out clearly. 

The reco=
rding was really bad, i couldn't even tell that it was a box that i was lis=
tening to. It sounded like you were under water and the file was over proce=
ssed to death.

I know you didn't over process it, so it was probably just =
a bad recording. Try again when you get that new recorder, it really does m=
ake a difference to the people who listen to the files.

I'm sorry i could =
not make anything out, but i'm sure it was a great session. I just wanted t=
o be honest about what i heard on my end.
