Fir=\r\nst consider the potential link between healing and PK. Both phenomena can o=\r\nccur due to a local or distant agent. Absent healing for example would be t=\r\nhe distant analogy to distank or remote PK. Both have been studied in contr=\r\nolled experiments. Dr Larry Dossy in Texas is one of the primary investigat=\r\nors in healing research. Both healing and general PK are reliably observed =\r\nto be either intentional or spontaneous. So both exhibit similar traits. Bo=\r\nth involve apparent manipulation by the mind of the physical environment. A=\r\nnd certainly healing strongly implicates an indirect effect on complex syst=\r\nems. So it makes some sense that the two may indeed be related.\n\n  Now let&#39;=\r\ns turn to the evidence for PK as an explanation for the EVP. A close collea=\r\ngue of mine, a respected parapsychologist in Los Angeles, was working years=\r\n ago in a well-known haunted site in the Hollywood area. He recorded the vo=\r\nice of the home&#39;s owner, while standing next to the man. During this interv=\r\nal the man did not speak; no one heard what was recorded until it was playe=\r\nd back. This sounds like a classic EVP thus far. The playback was easily he=\r\nard by all. The man recognized his own voice, including swear words; he had=\r\n a penchant for swearing in his normal speech. This anecdotal story would s=\r\nuggest that PK could be an explanation for EVPs based on this single exampl=\r\ne alone. \n\n  Lastly we&#39;ll consider a recent experiment by Dr. Dean Radin. I=\r\nn this experiment, mediators were asked to influence which paths photons wo=\r\nuld take passing through one of two very tiny slits. You would expect this =\r\nto occur normally by random chance, producing an equal distribution of phot=\r\nons in two regions on the target photograph. When uninfluenced, this is exa=\r\nctly what happened. When the mediator tried to &#39;block&#39; one of the slits, th=\r\ne distribution shifted, indicating success. But this is not what&#39;s importan=\r\nt - it is necessary background. For the next trial, the machine was turned =\r\non and the exposure taken with no influence attempted. In fact, the mediata=\r\ntor was not even present. The following day the mediatator was asked to inf=\r\nluence the machine. He was not told the machine was turned off and could no=\r\nt even record at that time. The next day the image was inspected for the fi=\r\nrst time - the meditator again was not present. The image revealed a patter=\r\nn similar to the one produced when the mediatator successfully &quot;blocked&quot; th=\r\ne slit in the first trial. Theoretical physicst Dr. Richard Stroup suggeste=\r\nd this indicated to him a demonstration of what he calls &quot;retrocausation&quot; -=\r\n a notion in theoretical physics that the future actually impacts on the pa=\r\nst (as well as the past impacting the future as most people believe). Dr. R=\r\nadin raised an interesting point with respect to designing experiments. He =\r\nnow wonders if investigators are so entangled with experiments that they un=\r\nwittingly can influence outcomes even before the experiment is designed. Re=\r\nmember, these are trained academicians at the top of their respective field=\r\ns. \n\n  This implies that retrocausation could be at work during EVP product=\r\nion. And that suggests the involvement of the operator as opposed to discar=\r\nante entities manipulating the environment.\n\n  I have no problem with the n=\r\notion that external influences may indeed in some way mediate what is done;=\r\n I simply wonder if they are really manipulating sound directly.\n\n  This is=\r\n what I could consider the evidence for the position I stated.\n\n  --- In EV=\r\nP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;April Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Perso=\r\nnal experience, and lack of supporting evidence is why I disagree about PK =\r\nbeing responsible for most EVPs.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; I am open to the possibility that=\r\n it might be possible, however it would have to be a very rare occurrence.\n=\r\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n  &gt; From: phenom_investigator \n=\r\n  &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n  &gt; Sent: Sunday, October 11, 2009 1:30 PM=\r\n\n  &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Question for you all\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Why do you d=\r\nisagree that PK is responsible for most true EVPs? \n  &gt; What about EVPs and=\r\n/or PK tells you this might be so?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;April Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; I agree in that much of EV=\r\nP is just pareidolia, or the listener hearing what he wants to hear.

This could include discarnate \n  agents. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; When you carefully consider what is being \n  heard, the themes of=\r\nten seem to reflect what may be subconscious concerns of \n  the operator or=\r\n the listener. If external sources additionally inform this \n  process of p=\r\nerception, it is quite possible they influence both what is \n  recorded and=\r\n how is later perceived. This would also nicely explain why some \n  people =\r\nhear the same things on a recording while others hear quite different \n  th=\r\nings and more importantly while one person hears different things from the =\r\n\n  same recording at different times.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; It would a=\r\nlso \n  remove the requirement that discarnates manifest the phenomena. If d=\r\niscarnates \n  are indeed non-physical, it is unclear how they would modify =\r\nthe physical \n  world. On the other hand, we have good evidence demonstrati=\r\nng the ability of \n  living individuals to alter their environments in prof=\r\nound ways, apparently \n  with their minds. So it seems to make more sense t=\r\nhat this might indeed by the \n  underlying mechanism to EVPs rather than di=\r\nscarnate manipulations.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, \n  &quot;mrs=\r\ncaptainjack2&quot; &lt;jjkamp@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m wondering if a \n =\r\n haunting-type situation such as yours would be different from talking to y=\r\nour \n  ancestors four or five generations back?
