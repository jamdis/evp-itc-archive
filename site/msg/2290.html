<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I believe that each box carries it&#x27;s own signature and the spirits that 
communicate through that box know the individual box by the energy it 
gives off. So they get used to a certain person that has been using 
that individual box and when the user changes they get somewhat 
confused about who is using the box. But I think they are getting used 
to me being the new user. my sessions are becoming more and more 
responsive. I have posted some file from session #2 with the box, they 
are in the files section please let me know what you think.
