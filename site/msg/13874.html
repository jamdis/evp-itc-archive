Oh LOL!! No...you are technically correct.

There are 2 instruments that us=
 ghost hunters have in our arsenal that can go by the name of "DVR"; Digita=
l Voice Recorder and Digital Video Recorder.

To save some confusion, some =
of us refer to a digital voice recorder as simply a voice recorder. I have =
gotten so used to this term that I automatically think digital video record=
er when I hear DVR.

I also have an Olympus digital voice recorder. I LOVE =
it. In fact, I have had many over the years. I have had other brands too, b=
ut Olympus recorders are the best, as far as the affordable versions go.

  DVR, as in digital voice recorder. I'm not usded=
 to using this new techno stuff, so maybe the terminology is wrong. Anyway,=
 I got it at Sams, $60, and it does have an external mic jack. I made a lin=
e to mic level adapter so I can record directly from the boxes. This one ha=
s built in USB connector, so it connects directly the PC. It records in WMA=
 format, and that is easliy converted to mp3, or played my windows media pl=
