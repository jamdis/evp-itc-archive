<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I get requests for boxes, and I think some get offended that I don&#x27;t just
whip out a box and throw it at them for &quot;their research&quot;. Trouble is,
there&#x27;s too many whack jobs out there wanting to be the world&#x27;s onlyest box
expert, or the ones desperately grieving, or lately, religious nuts!

 I&#x27;ve said it over and over and over and over and over and over--expectation
will create the voices you want to hear. If you are seeking Jesus, that is
exactly what you are going to get and you&#x27;ll swear it&#x27;s God gospel freaking
truth, and the rest of us should bow down to you. I think y&#x27;all know who I&#x27;m
talking about.

 I am uncertain if one can ask for certain spirits, or if even that tends to
create what one wans. I think maybe it works the same as the above. I don&#x27;t
ask for any specific spirits/entities, I don&#x27;t ask questions, I just let
them talk and try not to influance it. If I have question, I might think it,
and most of the time they&#x27;ll answer, wiht out me asking.  That could be just
creating want I want to hear as well--don&#x27;t know.

 I don&#x27;t have to be on these groups and I don&#x27;t have make  boxes, except for
my own use. I think the messages are personal in nature, no one is going to
hear it the same, and it&#x27;s about worthless as &quot;evidence&quot;. We get enough
that&#x27;s shareable to show others that it&#x27;s real, and I think that is about
the best that can be hoped for. I think, and it is only my opinion, that
&quot;evidence&quot; at so called haunted areas is just what is expected, I really
don&#x27;t think it proves anything.

 Then, there the bullies that want all this to conform to their wishes, and
we saw more examples of that with the recent e-bay auction, and y&#x27;all know
who you are! If no one sells boxes, no one builds boxes, its&#x27; that simple!
Parts and radios are not free, and why the hell should we be expected to
spend endless hours on this stuff for nothing!?

 I know, I know --sacrilege!-- I should be banned from all groups and box
work, burned at the stake, tarred and feathered, run out of town on rail,
how dare I say anything!?
