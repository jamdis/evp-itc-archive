<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have posted a couple of standard evp files and before i post any 
box sessions iam wondering do you prefer an edited down version or 
all of the file.
I guess i should introduce myself to the groupmy name is mike I 
belong to a none profit organization called Northern IL Ghost 
Hunting Team aka N.I.G.H.T or Night paranormal research I live in 
grand detoure IL right near oregon and dixon about 45min outside of 
rockford IL Ive been doing para research for awhile iam 31 started 
reading books when i was in junior high and after high school did a 
little investigating and it has grown since then and no iam not part 
of the paranormal band wagon but I do think that the explosion of 
researchers is great the more the world raises ther conciosness of 
the paranormal the easier i theink it is for us to get good 
comunication files i have from 5 and 10 years ago are crap compared 
to what i get today wether its the technoligy or the effort iam not 
sure but its much easier to see ten lights then it is to see one .
anyway i startes with an rs hack 469 back in nov 07 and the first 
thing to come across was &quot;mike are you there mike mike were did he 
go mike mike are you still ther&quot; I  did not hear it at the time but 
i did  continue asking questions and right after that i asked are 
you alwas hear or just hear because of the box and clear as i speak 
every day i heard &quot;THE BOX&quot; now those statements nfloored me and i 
was hooked ever since there is so much in just those 2 ststments 
when the voice says WERE DID HE GO well who is he asking and then 
THE BOX well if its not your normal close doors and hear footsteps 
kind of spirit then who is it . these questions have driven me ever 
since 
I beleve the only way to further our research is to be open and 
honest and to shrare everything that comes along and i am hoping 
that is what everyone is hear to do iam very excited to be a part of 
this group. and any evidence i have gatherd any one hear is more 
than welcome to it iam trying to put a website togather now and i 
will be puting alot up ther so when thats done i look forward to 
your input.enjoy the files i have posted and feel free to give me 
your feedback id love to hear what everyone thinks the file named 
head is saying .
