&gt;   I use both though I personally prefer using AM.
&gt;
&gt; A lot of it depends on the device being used, its range and reception, the
&gt; resulting audio clarity and what &quot;they&quot; wish for me to use as well.
&gt;
&gt; Many times the ones I speak to and work with will give me specifics and ask
&gt; me to adjust my sweep speeds, the specific scans and programs available to
&gt; them or even just to switch from AM to FM and vice versa.
&gt;
&gt; To find the most optimal scanning rates and audio settings I prefer to use
&gt; dowsing (with pendulums, L-Rods, an aurameter, etc), applied kinesiology and
&gt; muscle testing. Before my box sessions and recordings I always spend some
&gt; time (a few minutes, at least) in meditation...nothing too involved or
&gt; outrageous...just enough to get clear, become centered, grounded, focused,
&gt; open, receptive and properly attuned to subtle beings and energies.
&gt;
&gt; Once I&#x27;ve entered a state of relaxed focused awareness (very similar to
&gt; meditation or self hypnosis) I&#x27;ll go ahead and connect with a higher energy
&gt; field, my ancestors or the spirit world in general and begin the process of
&gt; dowsing while posing my questions, mentally or aloud, to find the best
&gt; possible combination of bands, scans, sweep rates, volume, distance and
&gt; other factors which all contribute to great recordings and helpful,
&gt; empowering, inspiring and positive exchanges with those in Spirit.

&gt; has anyone tried the short-wave frequencies
&gt;
