It will be very\ninteresting one way or another.\n\nCarol B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Just thought I would drop in to let you all know that Dr. Ciaran\n&gt; O&#39;Keeffe has borrowed a Mini from our team (the initial prototype) and\n&gt; will be using it tonight during part of their investigation in\n&gt; Gettysburg. It is a LIVE event tonight on the Travel Channel beginning\n&gt; at 8 p.m. EST. It will be interesting to see what they catch with the\n&gt; box, if anything! :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
