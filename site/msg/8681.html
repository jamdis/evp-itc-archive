<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank,

to get rid of the annoying clicking sound without having to slaughter
the radio and build up a whole sweep generator circuit around it,
wouldn&#x27;t it perhaps help to connect a simple low pass filter between the
original VT cable and the VT pin? Simply a capacitor of let&#x27;s say 1 ï¿½F
between the VT pin and ground, and a resistor of let&#x27;s say 10 k between
the VT cable and the VT pin? This would perhaps smoothen the tuning
voltage during the scanning process.

Is it possible that you try this quickly? It shouldn&#x27;t take much time,
and would be of great advantage if it worked...

&gt; Yeah, I was playing with trying to get rid of the clicking sound, and
&gt; saw the VT pin. I found I could manually tune the radio with a volume
&gt; control, or pot, so I had to make a board for it with a sweep
&gt; generator. Now I wish I would have bought the shortwave version!
&gt; Ahhhhh Box 36! Of course, Olgra(old and grumpy wife) isn&#x27;t too happy
&gt; at paying for a $25 radio that has just been gutted!
 
&gt;  BTW, external tuning gets rid of the clicking, and the audio is surprisingly clear.
