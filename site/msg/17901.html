I have an idea, those that do not want any  files from me, please say so, 
those on the list that do, just mail me privately,  and I will share my stuff 
only with you, when I get a file that is something  from Angels or 
whomever, I will just email it to you privately to see what you  think.  Other wise 
I will not post my files to the lists any longer, sorry  but I am not going 
to change my personality, I did not squawk at any of one  else's files, all 
those other people that send in files.  Some to me  might be offensive, and 
I may not care for, yet I don't say a  thing, because I believe in freedom 
of speech...if you don't like what I  send, just pass me up, don't even try 
to listen to them, chances are maybe you  cannot hear them anyway.   I do not 
control what Spirit's say to me,  how did you ever get that idea?   sf
