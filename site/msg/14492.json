S=\r\no we need to talk about what you mean by that.\n\n                           =\r\n When you use the microphone, you just speak, and let the recorder do the r=\r\nest.  In this case, you are using the recorder without really knowing how i=\r\nt works.   If a spirit can manipulate the EMF field around the AtoD convert=\r\ner (even without using the mic), then they should be able to do the same: j=\r\nust use it without knowing how it works: the recorder does the rest.  In ne=\r\nither case do either of you need to know how it works, to get it to work. I=\r\n am not questioning this.\n\n                            But, if they are goi=\r\nng to change the bits on the actual media themselves, then they must know h=\r\now it works, it order to get all those bit-things I mentioned right.  The r=\r\necorder can&#39;t &quot;do the rest&quot;, because by changing the bits on the media them=\r\nselves, they are going completely around what the recorder does, and doing =\r\nthe details themselves.  And as I said, the details there are very technica=\r\nl, and include things like converting their words into digital samples of g=\r\nroups of a specific number of bits in a specific format on specific places =\r\nin specific orders with other specific other bits connected to them like fi=\r\nle ownership and dates and such.  It is the job, basically, of a computer, =\r\nnot a person.\n\n                            If they are changing the bits on=\r\n the media, then the recorder is not doing that.  They are no longer lettin=\r\ng the recorder &quot;do it&quot;, like you or they would be if they just used it norm=\r\nally.  The reason you can &quot;make it work&quot; without understanding it, is becau=\r\nse the recorder is doing the work for you.  If they are to change the media=\r\n directly, then the recorder is no longer doing the work, and so they must =\r\nunderstand all those digital issues.\n\n                            So that i=\r\ns the difference between being able to use it without understanding it, and=\r\n not being able to use it.\n\n\n\n                            --- On Wed, 5/20/=\r\n09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n     =\r\n                         From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostre=\r\nsearch. com&gt;\n                              Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: I hav=\r\ne a question.\n                              To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n  =\r\n                            Date: Wednesday, May 20, 2009, 3:11 PM\n\n\n      =\r\n                        =EF=BB=BF \n\n                              My point =\r\nwas that they don&#39;t need to know how it works for it to work, like my analo=\r\ngy of when I speak into a microphone.

And a \n      =\r\n            line recording uses a signal, not from the mic, but from some \n=\r\n                  other source, to do the same.&nbsp; So if that signal wer=\r\ne to \n                  be manipulated via external EMF, it would change th=\r\ne final \n                  result on the tape.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Since we are a=\r\nlso assuming \n                  that digital recorders can pick up spirits,=\r\n then the simplest \n                  explanation is that that same up-fron=\r\nt signal (before it gets \n                  digitized into bits) is also be=\r\ning manipulated.&nbsp; And an \n                  EMF source could theoretic=\r\nally manipulate both the analog tape \n                  signal, and the dig=\r\nital tape signal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, it may be \n                  that an EMF =\r\nsource strong enough to modify the signal would \n                  also eff=\r\nect all kinds of other things in the unit, including \n                  the=\r\n final media itself.&nbsp; It would be interesting for \n                  s=\r\nomeone to determine what kind of external EMF is needed to \n               =\r\n   induce or modify a signal in the pre-digital phase of the \n             =\r\n     recording circuitry, and what side effects that would \n               =\r\n   have.&nbsp; Depending on the result, it could either reveal \n           =\r\n       other ways to detect spirit influence, or prove that no spirit \n    =\r\n              influence (via EMF) is happening.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On \n    =\r\n              &lt;B&gt;Wed, 5/20/09, April Abercrombie &lt;I&gt;&lt;april@abercrombiegh=\r\n \n                  ostresearch. com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;

I am not questioning \n   =\r\n                         this.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But, if they are going to change the =\r\n\n                            bits on the actual media themselves, then they=\r\n must \n                            know how it works, it order to get all t=\r\nhose \n                            bit-things I mentioned right.&nbsp; The r=\r\necorder \n                            can&#39;t &quot;do the rest&quot;, because by changi=\r\nng the bits on \n                            the media themselves, they are =\r\ngoing completely \n                            around what the recorder does=\r\n, and doing the details \n                            themselves.&nbsp; And =\r\nas I said, the details there \n                            are very technica=\r\nl, and include things like \n                            converting their wo=\r\nrds into digital samples of \n                            groups of a specif=\r\nic number of bits in a specific \n                            format on spec=\r\nific places in specific orders with \n                            other spec=\r\nific other bits connected to them like \n                            file ow=\r\nnership and dates and such.&nbsp; It is the \n                            jo=\r\nb, basically, of a computer, not a \n                            person.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;If they are changing the bits on the \n                            media=\r\n, then the recorder is not doing that.&nbsp; \n                            T=\r\nhey are no longer letting the recorder &quot;do it&quot;, \n                          =\r\n  like you or they would be if they just used it \n                         =\r\n   normally.&nbsp; The reason you can &quot;make it work&quot; \n                     =\r\n       without understanding it, is because the recorder is \n              =\r\n              doing the work for you.&nbsp; If they are to change \n        =\r\n                    the media directly, then the recorder is no longer \n   =\r\n                         doing the work, and so they must understand all \n =\r\n                           those digital issues.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So that is the \n   =\r\n                         difference between being able to use it without \n =\r\n                           understanding it, and not being able to use \n   =\r\n                         it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Wed, 5/20/09, April \n=\r\n                            Abercrombie &lt;I&gt;&lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresea=\r\nrch. \n                            com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
