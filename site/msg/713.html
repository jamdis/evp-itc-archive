there are many methods of communication on both sides, it could be someone you know calling you, or a prankster tryin to upset you, like i said youll just have to try n communicate. There are other ways of tryin to communicate too, such as automatic writing using a pedulum etc, BUT unless you find someone wise in these methods DO NOT USE THEM , do NOT use a ouijja either. YOU can produce negative efefcts ie call in spirits you dont want around. Its like using a cell phone , anyone can pick up the signal and hear you if they are in the right area. always try to do research BEFORE attempting something. MOST people use "protection" before using any method, you can do reserarch on this too. I just say a basic thing, protect me, let no one harm me and may no evil or bad spirits make contact or come home with me!

they call the cats too, and the cats go running to them.
they are crystal clear voices, and just come about at the oddest times.,
but they call family members by name.  they usually are behind the
person....and will then call their name.   its become a running joke in our
family now  as this has gone on for 10 years.
I bought a voice activated tape recorder... in hopes of capturing this on
tape. but no luck yet,.
I was told to take Pics around the house to look for orbs and such.  we have
never 'seen' anything, but we've seen activity,  books that get picked up
off the shelf, suspend in air and then drop to the floor (that one scared my
son & I as we were eatchign tv when it happened), doors that open and close
thru out the day & night when I am only one home.
chair cushions that were yanked down while I sat there and watched it... and
the one that surprised us all is our house has an odd freestanding fireplace
with a round platform with white rocks.   something kicked the rocks one
evening while we watched tv, and the rocks flew across the room.___
I  was impress in ghost hunters and how they captured voices on recorders.
and thought that might help us solve this.    we dont have ghosts, we dont
have orbs,m we just have something that calls us by name, calls the cats,
and moves things in the house.
