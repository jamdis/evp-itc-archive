Although I personally don&#39;t\nthink that sound is the key.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Hi Bruce.  I hear most the content in your clips as you are.  On this one, I believe it says, &quot;I\n&gt; will get us AIR speech.&quot;  I have repeatedly been told with this method that &#39;air&#39; has \n&gt; something to do with the communication.  \n\n&gt; Not sure what Arthur&#39;s definition of &#39;air&#39; is, but it is definitely key to what is taking place.  \n&gt; He&#39;s used terms and phrases like &quot;Air-to-air&quot; - &quot;Air Ports&quot; - &quot;Air Portals&quot; - &quot;Helps you \n&gt; enter our air&quot; - &quot;They&#39;ll give you air to us&quot; - &quot;I have air&quot; etc.  MANY references.\n\n&gt; Margaret"}
