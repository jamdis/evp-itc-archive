<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m using R.Shack speaker #21-549.  It&#x27;s nice, and no external power needed.  :-)

&gt; for you the best will probably be the 12-820, but you will have to buy a speaker with 
it.  They have radio shack ham radio speaker that work well with the radios
&gt;  
&gt; Link
&gt; that is the old 470, but if you order online they will automatically send you the new 
one.  I have alreqdy tried it.  Radio Shack doesn&#x27;t update their site very much.

&gt; If you want a box you can go to Radio Shack and purchase one.  product # 12-
469, 12-820, 12-470 (old radio Color gray and white.  New will not work and its 
black), and the 20-125.  Any of these radios can be use as ghost boxes and are 
very good for investigations.  If you need help hacking the box (very easy)  or 
questions about it. Just send me a email at reesclarke_69@ yahoo.com  or post on 
the group.  We will all help you guy get set up.

&gt; I was wondering if any one might have a box that they might be interested in selling to 
a small group of investigators in Michigan?
&gt; Or possibly loan one to us for a while? Purchasing would be better...we have a few &quot;hot 
spots&quot; in Muskegon county that we would like to try further research on. 
&gt; Last Saturday evening a small bunch went to a really hot cemetery and there we picked 
up on a woman who was just walking through the area as I was in the bushes 
relieving myself. And no camera was even handy!!  OY!! LOL   We 
wanted to try some EVP&#x27;S but the rain was coming down so hard that it was a bit 
discouraging to say the least.
