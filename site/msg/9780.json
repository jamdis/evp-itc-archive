They \nfit perfect. Can&#39;t wait to see how my session comes out when I clean \nthem up a bit.\n\nI recorded two sessions the second one the reception was so bad I \ndidn&#39;t get much I could hear. I seem to have an Australian spirit \nnamed &quot;Steve&quot; on my first recorded session he said his name in a  \nAustralian accent and on the second session he said &quot;gidday&quot;.\n\nKay\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ooops... forgot to give you the info, Kay:  Part # 274-373\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?\n&gt; productId=2062470&cp=&sr=1&origkw=1%2F8+to+3%2F32&kw=1%2F8+to+3%\n2F32&pa\n&gt; rentPage=search\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Kay.  You&#39;ll get the same patch cable AND an adapter (1/8 \nfemale to 3/32 male, I \n&gt; think, \n&gt; &gt; double check).  That&#39;s what I have to use on my Panasonic DR60, \nsince the ear jack on \n&gt; that is \n&gt; &gt; smaller.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am heading to Radio shack after I get off work. I am taking \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; micro cassette recorder with me. The mic hole in the recorder \nis way \n&gt; &gt; &gt; smaller then the one that goes into the pc. The recorder is a \nRadio \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shack recorder so hopefully they will have one. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
