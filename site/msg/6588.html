I would be more than happy to.  The owner signed a discloser with the production company as well as the SciFi channel.  Once it air's I will be more than happy to let you know and see the history and details yourselves!
   
  Thanks for the interest!

  Yes it has Ann!  The amazing things are that some of the clips say the full names of the former residents.  This is a famous story as well and once we get the ok, I will be more than happy to share with all of you.  This houses history go's back to the 1800's and has been documents up until the current owner. 
   
  One of the former residents divorced his wife (which is documented in court records) because of abuse from the children.  This took place in the civil war ara and in fact was able to collect his civil war pension.  It is believed that some of the beating may have taken place by the creek with a whip (which is actually mentioned in the clips).

  These files are the responses we got when asked if something tragic happened in the home.  The last one clearly reflects that a possible negitive spirit didn't want us asking anymore questions.
   
  Let me know what you think!
   
  Thanks!
