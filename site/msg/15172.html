[EVP-ITC] sometimes they get you while your coming AND going :)





  I we=
nt out to record today out in country. Was about 3 miles out-have recorded =
here before (Vandelia). This time my recorder was acting up (DR60). The REC=
 led indicator would flash sometimes (supposed to remain steady) and I woul=
d notice that the timer would stay in place for sometimes 5 seconds before =
it would change up one number....I though I had broken it somehow. I did he=
ar lots of LOUD splatter noises on playback while in the field. My battery =
indicator showed 2 of 3 bars, but I went in to town and got fresh AAA's any=
way. I then went to water trough and the flashing still happened for 2 reco=
rdings here. I then said for the "bad guy" to leave and stop messing with m=
y recorder. Well then on my 3rd attempt....recorder started working fine. A=
fter I finished the 3rd recording I packed up and went to the fairgrounds (=
just a spur of the moment) *I thought.....so at fairgrounds I recorded for =
a little over 10 minutes (I stopped at an old -church/school/courthouse- (s=
ingle room log cabin-multiple uses back then) that was used in Debuke Iowa =
during 1823 (think was date). And I also asked questions around 2 other rec=
onstructed buildings from long ago. Well I got home....when my recorder was=
 acting up in country I find a Male evp say "Get Out Of My Face". I think h=
e was guy messing with my recorder........Then while at the water trough (r=
ecorder still acting up even with 2 new batteries) I finally get it to work=
 (after telling what I think followed me "to leave"). At the end of my last=
 recording (the good one) from this water trough, I hear a little girl say =
"come to the fair....someone said" ***So I didn't go to the fairgrounds uni=
nvited*** I just decided to go for know reason I had guessed. Well what I a=
m so "disturbed" about now.........is that while I was playing these other =
recordings I ACCIDENTALLY-ERASED my 10 plus minutes of recording from fairg=
rounds BEFORE I even got a chance to listen or download it. OOOoooowwww!!! =
:) Makes me mad. No telling what could have been on there. I was INVITED>>>=
>shucks!! I will upload the "get out of my face" as the little girl is way =
to quite to hear. The guy is not so quite-but is still LOW audio. I don't w=
ant him playing with my recorder anymore :/
