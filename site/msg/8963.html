<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rees. I only partially agree with that sentiment.  If we are talking about people with a 
reasonable degree of critical thinking and mental stability, then you have my full buy-in 
on that concept.  

However, it&#x27;s my opinion there are *plenty* of people out there who should never touch a 
box of any flavor with a 10-foot pole, and having people who are mentally and/or 
emotionally unstable and who lack critical thinking, just mucks up the works and makes 
the rest of us look bad.  

ie:  People who believe and promote the idea that a &quot;murderous reptilian race&quot; is 
communicating through the DR60.  Yeah, you know...  I really don&#x27;t want to be put in the 
same category with them, just because I own a DR60.  But rest assured, I got an email one 
time from someone assuming that of me, letting me know that she was a believer too!  
OMG!!!!!

&gt; No bodies at fault, but I would do the hack just to help more people get in this field.  As 
Bruce sayes the more people the better comunication we will have.

&gt; 
&gt; Well, all I can say is the market is driven by BUYERS. If people are willing to pay, you 
can&#x27;t 
&gt; fault the person selling for taking advantage of what the market will bear. Perhaps the 
&gt; people who do not have the tools, or the skills, to do their own hack, feel this price is 
&gt; reasonable?

&gt; &gt; &gt; This guy who sells on Ebay does get 55.00 a unit for them. He is 
&gt; &gt; out f New 
&gt; &gt; &gt; York. He originally wanted 129.00 for it. I was considering 
&gt; &gt; posted a 12-469 
&gt; &gt; &gt; for 24.95 plus shipping and I will modify it for free or if 
&gt; &gt; anyone wanted 
&gt; &gt; &gt; too I was going to post the instructions to modify one on the 
&gt; &gt; same add just to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; screw with this guy. What do you thing?

&gt; &gt; &gt; On ebay I just saw a RS12-469 in a auction and the bid was 
&gt; &gt; $49.95. I can&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe this shit that people try to pull off.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Holy shit! That&#x27;s insane! Well, if people are paying for it, 
&gt; &gt; then more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power to &#x27;em.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; On ebay.de I saw one for €25 (about €40), what is still 
&gt; &gt; expensive for
&gt; &gt; &gt; such an old and low-quality device.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the Raudive method with a germanium 
&gt; &gt; diode.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Radio shack only carries silicon, so I&#x27;ll have to order the 
&gt; &gt; germanium
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and give it a shot.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; You could also try a schottky diode which is more sensitive than a
&gt; &gt; &gt; german diode. See: http://en.wikipediagerman diogerman digerma
