<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, easy if you know what you&#x27;re looking for. You have to find the tuning
voltage line coming form the processor, then cut it and insert your own
tuning voltage. I didn&#x27;t even know about the mute function when I did these,
I use a different conversion method.

 I have an older, made in 1998 Radio Shack home stereo that I got out of the
trash at work, that had the service manual wiht it, so I found the mute
circuit and removed the two transistors to make it sweep. Then added a push
button so the tuning button doesn&#x27;t have to be held in. Push the button in
and instant GB mode. That one collects duct too, but it&#x27;s heavy.

&gt; Was it easy to hack?  How is it as a ghost box?  I would like to do this
&gt; one, since everything still works great, and it has those two big speakers,
&gt; I don&#x27;t go anywhere to need portable, and I have these others if i did, how
&gt; does yours sound for ghosts?  Where is the mute wire in it?  Is there a
&gt; symbol for the mute?  And which board is it on, there seem to be a few
&gt; boards in this one. Thanks, s

&gt;    Goofy google won&#x27;t show the pix,  but I have an Aiwa 3 cd system that&#x27;s
&gt; converted to a ghost box. It&#x27;s a home stereo system so not at all portable.
