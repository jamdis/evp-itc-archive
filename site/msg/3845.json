As a Legal Secretary/assistant & &quot;Independent&quot; Paranormal  \n&gt; Investigator, etc. I disagree with you, but THAT&#39;s OK!\n&gt;\nYou&#39;re right, it is okay for us to disagree.\n&gt; =Judy= P.S.When you get your box, you can start your bussiness and  \n&gt; make money, too, like Chris!! Perhaps that&#39;s what&#39;s needed . . .  \n&gt; competition!\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;ve never made a dime off my paranormal ability and I never will.\n\nThanks for playing,\n\nAnn"}
