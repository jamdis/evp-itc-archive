{"id": "2107", "subject": "EVP Experiment planned in October.", "author": "delchay2005", "timestamp": "2007-09-18T23:47:24Z", "full_text": "To try and rule out that the EVP researchers are imprinting voices \npsychokinetically on audio players mistaken as ghosts voices, I will \npre-tape an interactive evp session.\n\n \nI will record a bank of thirty questions, 20 seconds of silence \nafter each question, on a cassete tape and played on a cassette \nplayer that will be utilized in all three buildings in a known \nhaunted location just outside of Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThere will be digital recorders, cassette recorders, omni \ndirectional microphones, condensor microphones, as well as an \nelectrocet boom microphone present in all of the sessions. There \nwill be no human agents in the buildings when these sessions take \nplace.\n\nMy hope is to:\n\nRecord an authentic EVP with no human agent in the building. \n\nIf this is phenomena driven, will the phenomena communicate by \nresponding to questions from a machine rather than a human agent? \n\nIf you have any ideas to enhance this experiment, please feel free \nto let me know. This experiment will take place on October 27th. \n\n\nJames"}
