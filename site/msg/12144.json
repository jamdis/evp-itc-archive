It then occurred to me that I was being skeptical of something\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that I have never sat down and tried. Not having much money, I went\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with the shack hack method. My first session was phenomenal, and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; although I don&#39;t know how mystery voices can accurately and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; contextually answer my questions posed to what is, in effect, a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; malfunctioning radio, I am only left with the knowledge that it works.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; At least it worked for me. Believe me, it drives me insane trying to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; figure out the mechanism by which spirits would be able to communicate\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with a box spitting out chunks of broadcast fragments. That being\n&gt;&gt;&gt; said, though, it really isn&#39;t anymore of a leap of faith than the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; coil-induction theory of evp collection, I mean, how would a spirit\n&gt;&gt;&gt; know how to manipulate focused emf fields to produce corresponding\n&gt;&gt;&gt; frequency.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; As to what the voices might be, I have to say as far as I am\n&gt;&gt;&gt; concerned, the jury is still out. I am wondering if there isn&#39;t some\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sort of latent PK element in play by the operator, it would certainly\n&gt;&gt;&gt; explain why the information is so accurate and specific. I am working\n&gt;&gt;&gt; on a &quot;blind&quot; test to study that to my own satisfaction. The phenomenon\n&gt;&gt;&gt; may very well be external entities trying to make contact, and if so,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that is just as cool. Either way, having thought the concept was\n&gt;&gt;&gt; absurd at one time, I simply gave it a shot and the results were\n&gt;&gt;&gt; undeniable. Honestly, subsequent attempts at ITC with the shack hack\n&gt;&gt;&gt; have produced mixed results, none with the in-your-face accuracy of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the first time. Suffice it to say it is dissapointing I cannot have\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that kind of success every time, but I can certainly say that there is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a force at work here and my curiosity is understandibly aroused.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; thanks\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Andy\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;maggotfurcoats&quot; &lt;katkat23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But, are there any files on this group where any of you believe you\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are communicating with a spirit?

But everything else I have\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heard so far in the files here is not striking me as the voice of any\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; apparition, due to the weakness of quality.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you&#39;re still reading this, I have to tell you I have had striking\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results in my own home, simply letting a recording device roll, and if\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you&#39;re not yet interested in hearing these samples, I guess you&#39;re\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more into the box than the afterlife and that&#39;s YOU, not me! :)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LOVE,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Katherine.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
