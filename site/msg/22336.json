We are having a problem right now and we need some help from\n&gt; &gt; Mr. Sumption.   We need help and need one of his boxes to help us with some\n&gt; &gt; evps and messages.   I will be willing to buy any older radio off ebay for\n&gt; &gt; parts for him if he told me what to buy and have them shipped to him.  i\n&gt; &gt; will pay for everything he needed to make us a box. Its very very important\n&gt; &gt; to us and i will even donate some money to an animal charity (love animals\n&gt; &gt; and my dogs) in his name or any charity his chooses if he would see it into\n&gt; &gt; his heart to please help us.  Please forward this to him. Thank you so so\n&gt; &gt; much.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jim Pfister\n&gt; &gt; 7338 N Adoline\n&gt; &gt; Fresno Ca 93711\n&gt; &gt; 559 905 4294\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/26/12, Rick Wegrzyn &lt;rickwegrzyn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Rick Wegrzyn &lt;rickwegrzyn@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] need help in trying to contact Mr sumption\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, April 26, 2012, 3:38 PM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He&#39;s my neighbor,what do you need\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: gmofghosthunting &lt;gmofghosthunting@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, April 26, 2012 11:58 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] need help in trying to contact Mr sumption\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Can anyone help me get in contact with mr sumption?
