I am  not \nrich but I gave (4) radios to deserving individuals to help further their  \nknowledge and research.  Even if I lost a couple of bucks on the venture I  still \nthink it would be worth it for people to know that we are out there and  they \nare not alone when they want to try and get into this research field.   Its \nalways nice to know that we are all just an email away.  And I think it  would \nsend a message to this guy in New York that there are people out here that  take \nthis very seriously and are not in it for the monetary gain but for the  \neducational and research end of it.  \n \nJeff\n \n \nIn a message dated 4/7/2008 5:30:32 P.M.
