Here is a link to a demo I posted on youtube almost a year ago. The demo shows music played through a small Radio Shack speaker is vibrating the flame at an audio rate. The flame vibrations are picked up by the two small solar type cells and this is the electrical signal that is then recorded. The fidelity is ok considering the process. Here is the link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ym0IXAvC7s&feature=channel\n\nThe only thing different in last nights session is that I used the old style 12-470 set to FM sweep in place of that amplified speaker. Here is another capture from last night. The message is long for a radio sweep.\n&quot;Terminals are not for talking to other people&quot;\n\nThanks for your interest & Happy New Year!,\nRetro-Dave\n\n--- michaelcoletta@... wrote:\n\nFrom: &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Boulder Mentioned\nDate: Thu, 01 Jan 2009 03:50:06 -0000\n\nHi Retro-Dave,\n\nDo the sound waves move the flame and the flame movement is sensed by \nthe microphone cicuit... connected to a digital recorder?\n\nSounds very interesting... please share more.\n\nThanks,\n- Mike (UFO Geek)\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Attention, any researchers in the Boulder area.
