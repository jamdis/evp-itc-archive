The systems seems to work better on \nbatteries, that why I don&#39;t use a bench power supply. I tried using AA \nbattery packs, but the life was short, so now I use 12 volt gel cells. I had \nthree 1.2 amp hour battteries, but I mounted them in #21, and it&#39;s out it \nthe world now, living it&#39;s own life. Now I have some used 7 ah batteries. \nCurrent draw is only about 50mh per battery, so they should last hours, and \nhours. There&#39;s just a little too much charge current for one charger, so I \nmake a triple regulator board, but they all run from one bridge, and a \nsingle transfomrer. Then I use an old priniter switch, the ones they used to \nconnect four computers to a single printer, and wire it so the batteries are \nseperated for charging, but join together to form the plus and minus \nsupplies needed for the boards. I make it so the circuits don&#39;t work while \ncharging, just to elimiate hum pick up.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet a FREE Web site, company branded e-mail and more from Microsoft Office \nLive! http://clk.atdmt.com/MRT/go/mcrssaub0050001411mrt/direct/01/"}
