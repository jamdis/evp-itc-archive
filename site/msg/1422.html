<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve,

I hope to have the time to listen to all of them.  I heard a couple and 
they&#x27;re very interesting.

I&#x27;ve gotten several EVP&#x27;s on my DVR that were at about twice the speed of 
normal voice.  It fascinates me that any entity could do that.  I&#x27;ve heard 
that others have gotten slowed voices on EVP, too, but I haven&#x27;t gotten 
any of those yet.

&gt; Welcome Zack, look forward to your take on the box and other ideas
&gt; given your engineering background.  Read past posts to get an idea of
&gt; what the group is about, i did and learned a lot of information about
&gt; this whole topic.
&gt;
&gt; Listen to the Uploaded Mp3 files in the FILES section and let us know
&gt; what you think of them.  I&#x27;m in there under Simple FM Sweep radio
&gt; design and would like to get some feedback.  I got some, but would
&gt; like more.  My radio is a slightly different design than frank&#x27;s and
&gt; want to know what people think.
&gt;
&gt; Thanx,
