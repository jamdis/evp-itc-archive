Well, i was cleaning up today and came across it. I \n&gt; &gt; turned it on and just held down the scan button and it scans \n&gt; through \n&gt; &gt; all the stations non-stop as long as you keep it pressed down. \n&gt; Which \n&gt; &gt; is no big deal since the recorded sessions for me are only \nusually \n&gt; 10 \n&gt; &gt; Min. tops. This model has been out for years and you can pick it \nup \n&gt; &gt; at your local Circuit city or Best buy, it&#39;s even on Ebay for \n$20. \n&gt; &gt; Circuit city i think is like $30. You have to plug headphones \ninto \n&gt; &gt; it or an external speaker, but it fits in the palm of your hand \nand \n&gt; &gt; the reception is better than all the rest. It runs off of 1 AAA \n&gt; &gt; battery and lasts forever. For those who are afraid to hack a \n&gt; radio, \n&gt; &gt; just pick this model up and hold the scan button down and away \nyou \n&gt; go \n&gt; &gt; right out of the packaging. I did open it up and there is a \n&gt; ribbon, \n&gt; &gt; but nothing was clearly marked so i will have to find the \n&gt; schematics \n&gt; &gt; online before i mess with it. The radio has AM/FM/WB/TV, however \n&gt; &gt; when i did the trial scans i found that the AM worked best and \n&gt; &gt; instantly received answers to my questions. I turned it on and \n&gt; asked \n&gt; &gt; if this is working and loud and clear they said &quot;yes&quot;.
