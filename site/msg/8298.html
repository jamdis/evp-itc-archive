&gt; 
&gt; I haven&#x27;t done that personally, because i don&#x27;t think that the 
&gt; communication is at the point to receive full sentences. You get a 
&gt; couple words here and there that we can piece together to make 
&gt; somewhat of a sentence, but i don&#x27;t believe anybody has reached 
that 
&gt; stage yet. If i got a full sentence that would be great, but it 
&gt; probably wouldn&#x27;t be clear enough to post on the board. If i have 
to 
&gt; explain what it says to convince people to hear it, than it&#x27; s 
&gt; probably nothing. When in doubt, throw the file out. I try to form 
&gt; the questions for the most part in Yes and No format, it seems they 
&gt; can always respond with yes and no. I do get other stuff that is 
&gt; good, but i try and keep it simple for them. And frank just sits 
&gt; back and listens without asking questions allowing them to get that 
&gt; message across. I prefer to ask questions, because i know when to 
&gt; wait for a response. The Skype session i had with my Joe&#x27;s box last 
&gt; friday with Juli and Joel was a great example of getting good 
&gt; communication. We were getting answers to all our questions and 
&gt; that &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; file was one of the clearest i have ever 
heard 
&gt; come through my Joe&#x27;s Box #2, which is now broken again. Juli has 
&gt; all the audio and will post more as she goes through it for 
everybody 
&gt; to hear.

&gt; &gt; Hi Steve, hope all is well with you.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; From this site it appears that yourself, Frank, Bruce, and 
&gt; Kristin and others I can not think of at the moment, have been 
&gt; engaged in contact as such that you ask a question and they give an 
&gt; answer. Have any of you ever taken the info you receive from lets 
say 
&gt; one spirit and tried to contact their living relative to give them 
a 
&gt; copy of the recording? Have spirits asked you more experienced 
&gt; researchers to do that, and if so, was the person you contacted 
&gt; indeed the correct loved one, and what was their response in you 
&gt; contacting them? I think this would be awesome to be able to serve 
&gt; as a messenger to the deceased
