<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I got an EVP once where someone asked something like &quot;Do you like it here?&quot;
and a male voice responded &quot;Leave this building!&quot;

That was the only one I&#x27;ve ever heard that sent chills down my spine.

&gt; If any of those people who&#x27;d made comments in response to the &quot;challenge&quot;
&gt; had had my experiences, they might change their minds. For instance once,
&gt; when I asked if it was OK to wrap up the session, I was very clearly told
&gt; &quot;Turn off the device.&quot; Clear as day and in direct response to my question.
&gt; No hearing what I want there.
&gt;
&gt; Then again, if any of those commenters had an open enough mind to hear
&gt; anything at all, I would be surprised.

&gt; &gt; I wouldn&#x27;t bother with that crap, there&#x27;s no way anyone is going to get
&gt; an
&gt; &gt; honest eval from Randi.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To me, you judge a box, or anything else by what it&#x27;s personal meaning
&gt; is.
&gt; &gt; Do the messages have meaning and coherence, or are they just random
&gt; &gt; disconnected words? When I here my name, and the names of others through
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; box, I&#x27;d have to be a real duffus to think that was just broadcast
&gt; &gt; fragments.
