Lauderdale and am contemplating going down  \nsome time this summer again.  Would you be interested in getting together  if my \nwife and I go?  We would love to see what is happening down  there.  We would \nbe staying at the beach area off a1a.  We could meet  at Aruba&#39;s for lunch to \nstart ...:)\n \nJeff\n \nIn a message dated 2/28/2008 1:17:12 P.M.

I organized this group in 1998, and have been in the research  \nof Ghost and Paranormal happenings ever since. I&#39;m the official paranormal  \nresearcher for the Stranahan House which is Fort Lauderdale&#39;s oldest and most  \nhaunted historical landmark. We have gotten many EVP&#39;s by use of digital  \nrecorder. There are 5 intelligent haunts that are in the house and one  residual \nhaunt outside of the house. Most of the evp work has been handled by  me, but I \nhave been teaching some of my member to work their own  recordings.\n \nI am totally fascinated by your use of the &quot;Frank&#39;s Box&quot;. My  congradulations \nto your success, Frank and those who use the box on the  research that you&#39;ve \naccomplished. In this, I&#39;m also dissappointed by those  who have used your \nbox to make money or notority to gain fame by it. I won&#39;t  mention names, to \nmention them will only give them more strength. \n \nWe are currently trying to do the Radio Shack hack of the 12-469 and hope  to \nbe successful in this trial by error. Hoping that our work will produce  \nsomething that we&#39;ve been trying to accomplish like you all have, two way  \ncommunication with astral beings. It&#39;s fustrating to do digital recordings and  \nhaving to wait and sift through the recordings to get information. We hope to  \nelliminate that with the hack.\n \nAre Frank&#39;s boxes available for retail? I&#39;ve heard of the Mini Box that  is \ncoming out soon and they are taking pre-orders for this product. Our group  is \nsmall and we don&#39;t charge for our research at the historical landmarks that  \nwe do here in Fort Lauderdale, so we are looking for the best at the lowest  \nroute approach.\n \nOur next project is a Historical Firehouse that is haunted by the ghost  of \nRobert Leland Knight. There is a mystery on how he died, but legend goes  that \nhe fallen in a water puddle that was electricfied by a downed wire. He  was a \nlarge man and a Golden Glove champ of Florida. It was his second week of  \nworking at the firestation and he didn&#39;t have his gear because it had to be  \nordered. There is some who think (psychics) that he might have been pushed out  of \nthe firetruck as a prank that went wrong.\n \nThis firehouse has had media play with the Sci-fi channel in a show  called \n&quot;Proof Positive&quot;. The firestation is becoming a museum, and is allowing  us to \nspend the night in doing an investigation about Robert. There are some  who \nbelieve that some of the haunt has to do with a hanging tree that was at  the \nopposite corner of the Firestation. We are excited about doing an  investigation \nof this Historical Landmark, but are cautious of the fact that  there will be \nlow level spirits/astral beings that might be present.\n \nFrank, If you have the time to answer me, that will be great. Those who  have \nthe &quot;Frank&#39;s box&quot;, if you can tell me how you obtained yours, that will  be \nhelpful also. I would be greatful for any help at this point.\n \nThanks for letting me listen in on all of your discoveries and  successes.\n \nBest Regards,\nJohn Marc Carr\n_www.sefgr.com_ (http://www.sefgr.com/) \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n**************Ideas to please picky eaters.
