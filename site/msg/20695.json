All sounds fall perfectly into place as being what you said.  And that is very very scary.  Lets hope that they are just plain freaking lying, or are being misinformed.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I know no one wiol hear it, and I&#39;ll get some &quot;this is waht it really says&quot;,\n&gt; but......Don&#39;t know what it means exactly, but I&#39;ve gotten that for months,\n&gt; and somoehtign about the 17th for yesars. but waht do I know?\n&gt; \n&gt;  FYI, dumped Facebook, first it&#39;s a huge waste of time, and second, more of\n&gt; these self proclaimed experts, psychics, and mediums telling me what this\n&gt; stuff really is, that my stuff doesn&#39;t anything, and...one guy that can&#39;t\n&gt; even be 40 telling me he got his first EVP in 1976--what when he was\n&gt; freaking two years old!? I&#39;m about done, can&#39;t even explain this shit\n&gt; without the one I&#39;m trying to explain it to getting all pissy, like how dare\n&gt; I state how the boxes work.
