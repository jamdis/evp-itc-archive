<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks! Yeah, I use two 12 supplies to get the plus and minus 12 
volts to run the sweep circuit. I use 7ah gel cells here on the 
bench, then in boxes, if I want to save room and $$ I use AA-8 packs. 
For boxes that will be used for public demonstrations and regular 
investigations, I use 1.2ah gel cells and constant voltage charger. 
The charging current is low enough for these batteries that excess 
current draw has not been a problem. I am working on one of these 
special demonstration boxes that has the built in charger, and can 
run while charging the batteries--hopefully there won&#x27;t be too much 
AC hum pick up by the mic. As with all the boxes so far, still 
experimental. For what I need I think Lithium ion would be too pricy, 
and NiCads, I just don&#x27;t like. NiMh, I&#x27;m don&#x27;t know much about.

&gt; Hi Frank,
&gt;  
&gt; Starting to all come together and looks really good.  Did you 
still  set that 
&gt; up for a 12 volt power source?  If so I can make recommendations  
as for 
&gt; batteries to use and that will last for quite a long time between  
charges.  The 
&gt; only problem is that a good battery charger would cost $40.00  or a 
really 
&gt; cheap one will cost $15.00.
