MAKE YOUR OWN GHOST BOX

You can make your own Ghost box that functions similar to a Frank&#x27;s 
box, Joe&#x27;s box and the Mini box. All you need to do is go to your 
local Radio Shack and pick up the 12-469  Digital AM/FM Pocket Radio 
for ONLY $24.99 plus tax and with a simple modification. You will 
have your very own cheap alternative to a &quot;GHOST BOX&quot;.

(I will insert a picture of the RS 12-469 here)

 
This simple modification lets the radio sweep both the AM and FM 
band. Instead of it scanning and stopping on a station, doing the 
modification (clipping the &quot;Mute&quot; pin) lets it just sweep the entire 
band, without stopping on any station. Just hook your Radio up to 
some speakers or headphones and while the radio is sweeping the 
bands start asking questions and get answers in real time.  You can 
also record it and review it later for answers you may have missed.

There are several sites for the FREE instructions on how to modify 
your Radio Shack 12-469.
