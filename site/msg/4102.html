<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m a ham too, but have stayed off the air since started with EVP in 
2000. For one thing I was afraid of ridicule, and another is this 
eats all of my &quot;spare&quot; time. I mentioned EVP to one of QRP club guys 
and he never spoke to me agian. I thinkit&#x27;s time to try to set up 
some nets.

&gt; Greetings Ken,
&gt; 
&gt; I am also a fellow &quot;licensed Ham Radio Operator&quot; and have been told 
&gt; by others that I am a &quot;Sensitive&quot;, which would explain much that 
has 
&gt; happened in my life.
&gt; On the subject of licensed operators, I&#x27;m guessing there may be 
many 
&gt; of us &quot;Hams&quot; who enjoy searching and exploring the world of heard &amp; 
&gt; unheard frequencies. It is one that is wide open at the moment. 
That 
&gt; is why we enjoy finding and experimenting with new techniques, 
&gt; devices, and ideas. We number many more than thirty, and there&#x27;s 
room 
&gt; for plenty more... Welcome to the group!
&gt; 
&gt; - Mike

&gt; &gt; Greetings All,  My name is Ken &amp; I&#x27;ve been reading the group for 
a 
&gt; few days now.
&gt; &gt; I have some observations &amp; a couple of ideas I&#x27;d like to share:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It amazes me how like minded intentions attract the same.
&gt; &gt; Like Rick Moran, Frank, &amp; Ron.  I too am a licensed Ham Radio 
&gt; Operator and 
&gt; &gt; am very interested in EVP,etc.  I&#x27;m also a Remote Viewer, 
&gt; Sensitive, &amp; dowser.
&gt; &gt; My studies have taught me that these things basically work on the 
&gt; same principles.
&gt; &gt; In Physics there&#x27;s something called Quantum entanglement.  In a 
&gt; nutshell, Its the 
&gt; &gt; idea of all things being familiar &amp; related due to their physical 
&gt; make up.  Like identical 
&gt; &gt; twins separated at birth, all things are connected and aware of 
one 
&gt; another, even though
&gt; &gt; miles apart &amp; separated for years.  Also, just as time &amp; space 
&gt; exists in a vacuum, all
&gt; &gt; things live forever.  Once a word is spoken or an attitude is 
acted 
&gt; out its effects can be 
&gt; &gt; witnessed forever, (Like dropping a pebble in water &amp; watching 
the 
&gt; ripples).  When I was 
&gt; &gt; teen I overdosed on some chemically treated weed.  I had an OBE &amp; 
&gt; saw the tunnel of 
&gt; &gt; white light thing, had the whole experience.  Ever since then 
I&#x27;ve 
&gt; understood that we are 
&gt; &gt; multidimensional, nothing dies, it only evolves or changes energy 
&gt; forms.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; People will always shy away from &amp; fear that which they don&#x27;t 
&gt; understand.  
&gt; &gt; They try to label things as evil, good, right, &amp; wrong.  Things 
are 
&gt; relative.
&gt; &gt; Your intentions are what makes things what they are.  You will 
&gt; always find
&gt; &gt; what you look for.  Keep up the good work, its all very 
interesting.
