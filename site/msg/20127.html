The zoom h2 quality is good too from what i've heard from kristins file=
s also. The rt-evp is tiny and is good for both evp and ghost box recording=
s.

The cheaper the quality, the better for regular evp i've found. But for=
 recording box sessions, you have to get something good. That way others ca=
n hear them clearly. 

Also, a cheap recording gets worse when run through =
an audio editor.
