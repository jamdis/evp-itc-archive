<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Marty,

I tried the IPOD thing a year ago and came to the conclusion that 
they need a live feed for communicating.  Not for messages, but real-
time back and forth stuff.

&gt; Andy, thanks for the compliments, much appreciated.  Main credit
&gt; should of course go to Frank though, he provided the main roadwork 
and
&gt; inspiration.  My main concern design wise for this was to have a
&gt; version that was compartmentalized (&quot;plug and play&quot; if you will) so
&gt; that components can be easily substituted for experimenting.  Plus
&gt; something lower powered to make it more portable, hence the idea to
&gt; use a low power speaker powered by the input device, and a
&gt; corresponding hearing assistance device as the mic/amp to amp it 
up. 
&gt; Once the lid is on, this thing is *loud* but clear.  In fact, I have
&gt; the amp set to min volume and its still a little to loud to listen 
to
&gt; with headphones sometimes unless you play around with equalizing the
&gt; volume settings on the 820 and the speaker.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m also going to be experimenting swapping out the 820 with an iPod
&gt; shuffle containing a lengthy pre-recorded sound file of audio.  30
&gt; second talk (maybe me reading the alphabet or something), chopped up
&gt; with EVP-Maker, and then spliced out to repeat for 30 minutes or 
so. 
&gt; I realize, as Frank stated previously, that they can effect sound
&gt; anywhere including in a control sound like this as its being 
recorded
&gt; or mixed.  But my concern is satisfying the &quot;skeptics&quot; out there 
who,
&gt; as you put it when you first joined the group, feel that using the
&gt; radio input it &quot;would be hard to distinguish from coincidence&quot;.  A
&gt; controlled input that can be referred back to for comparison would
&gt; satisfy that qualification that keeps getting thrown up. 
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I am loving this design. October hitting me pretty hard but will 
try
&gt; &gt; to scare up the jack to implement this design soon. thanks for 
your
&gt; &gt; hard work and posting easy-to-follow instructions.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; thanks again,
