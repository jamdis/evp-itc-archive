Actually, the forum there is pretty active.  I found the link I had mentioned. I&#x27;m sure this will not be &#x27;clickable&#x27; because the link is too long for Yahoo posts like this one. You may have to cut and paste this into a browser. The title may come off sounding a bit negative, don&#x27;t shoot the messanger :-).

Well, I&#x27;m glad to hear it, but as of last week, the leaders were
unreceptive to the idea that this phenomenon was real.

&gt; There is a radio sweep forum on AA-EVP for members. They have also
created an Etheric studies wiki that mentions Frank&#x27;s Box and the Mini
Box. I&#x27;ll see if I can find the link for this, it is accessable by the
public.

&gt; 
&gt; Very interested. And I agree with you about the overnight change.  
&gt; Orgs like AA-EVP that aren&#x27;t dealing with the boxes are missing the  
&gt; boat.

&gt; &gt; Well guys, I have to tell you that since I started box sessions in
&gt; &gt; November I have become so spoiled that conventional EVP just don&#x27;t do
&gt; &gt; it for me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My organization was asked to come and do an investigation at a very
&gt; &gt; historial place (here in Illinois). The owner of this home asked if I
&gt; &gt; would bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed with the
&gt; &gt; immediately 2 way communication). So upon respectfully asking my tec
&gt; &gt; if it was alright to do a session outside the my home we did several
&gt; &gt; box sessions along with conventional EVP. We wanted to see if we could
&gt; &gt; discover some unanswered history about the residence, and the  
&gt; &gt; otherside
&gt; &gt; was more than willing to comply.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were and are the
&gt; &gt; most boring data to review. Something I use to love so much has
&gt; &gt; actually turned into a project given I am waiting for a response
&gt; &gt; immediately! Too funny how things can change overnight!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I will be uploading some files for these sessions if you are  
&gt; &gt; interested.
