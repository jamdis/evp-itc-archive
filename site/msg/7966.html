<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There seems to be a few names here that I don&#x27;t recognise. Seems a 
few people have joined since I have been gone.

So I feel I must introduce myself. My name is Bruce Halliday, I have 
been a box researcher for quite sometime and have the distinct honor 
to have owned not one but two Frank&#x27;s boxes and currently am doing 
research with the latest model frank has given out.  I also have and 
do research with every other box that is available today. I have been 
away from this group for a couple of months now. I have decided to 
return to this group for the outstanding amount of professionalism 
here.

If there are any of the new people or even the old timers that may 
need some help or have a question, please do not hesitate to ask.

I mainly came back for the specific reason, of helping whom ever I 
can. I would like to share my experience and help to create as many 
productive researchers as possible.


Thanks for listening
Bruce</pre>
