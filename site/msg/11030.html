<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I use a couple different digital voice recorders, but have recorded
most of my good EVP&#x27;s with a Sony ICD-P320 just using the internal
microphone.  Some feel you need to use an external microphone, but I
tend to set the recorder down and let it do it&#x27;s thing.  I get more
EVP&#x27;s when it is just sitting there unattended or if we are talking
about random stuff than I do if asking questions.  I cannot hold my
recorders still enough in my hands to not get noise.  An external
microphone would help that, but I would rather just set the recorder
down.  Maybe some day I will get one and give it a try.  

The last investigation we went on, I got 12 good EVP&#x27;s.  Most were
short single word recordings, but they required no processing other
than a volume adjustment on a couple of the quieter ones.  Other
investigations I get nothing.  We would have activity, but nothing
would be recorded.  Also, I have recorded stuff only to have it
disappear off the recorder or computer.  Guess someone didn&#x27;t want it
to be shared.

Topics to talk about that seem to draw out the spirits are food,
alcohol, drugs and smoking.  Guess some of the spirits miss them and
if given a chance will join in and let you know their feelings.  I
haven&#x27;t tried talking about sex, but if the other topics work, it
might also.  I don&#x27;t think there is anything magic about getting
EVP&#x27;s.  It is just a matter of being around someone with something to
say.  Also, I don&#x27;t think the location really has that much to do with
it either.  I can get recording from my house almost as easily as a
&quot;haunted&quot; location.  To me, the negative spirits tend to be more vocal
but will give false information just to mess with you.  I believe
little if anything I record, but simply use it as evidence of
activity.    

I prefer digital for the ease of distributing and archiving
recordings.  The only editing I do is adjusting the gain and cutting
out parts of the recording that catch my interest.  As a personal
preference, I throw out any EVP&#x27;s that need any filtering or
manipulation to hear.  If it can&#x27;t be heard as it is (excluding volume
adjustments), I don&#x27;t use it.  I promise I am not trying to start an
argument.  As I said, it is just a personal preference.    

One of the best recordings I have was from my camcorder.  We could
also hear the spirit talking with our ears and were able to briefly
have two-way interaction.  The funny thing is, when asked a question,
the three of us present heard it say &quot;yes&quot;, but on the audio, it
clearly said &quot;no&quot;.
