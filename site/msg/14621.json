It could\n&gt; possibly be STIFF..  Can&#39;t be sure though.  As for the longer 2nd clip I can\n&gt; really only hear the whisper that says YES right before you state &quot;you&#39;re\n&gt; gonna go now&quot;. I know there was someone trying to communicate because there\n&gt; were a couple times I heard something but it was indiscernible to me.  \n&gt; \n&gt; k\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt; Not given\n&gt; Sent: Friday, May 22, 2009 6:12 PM\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] What do you think part 2\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; thanks for the feedback btw in the first one did you hear around 15 seconds\n&gt; .. thanks?\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyhow here is the rest of that piece.
