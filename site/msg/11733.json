This was my creation. I had the\n&gt; idea and , brought it to the paranormal community . We have not done a\n&gt; alive event in over 2 year. Nor has there been  attempt. It was a\n&gt; great concept. But unfortunately  it never took off . I will not have\n&gt; my name associated with something that boarders on fraud. \n&gt;     I am more than willing to share the temp plates , and the\n&gt; technology, and what is needed at the location,  and how  I set this\n&gt; up  for free .I will gladly explain  what server I used, and how to \n&gt; present a event what equipment  that is required, and how  it was\n&gt; promoted ,  also I will tell you the problems I ran in to so you can\n&gt; avoid them, as well as what I enjoyed about this,  my experience is at\n&gt; your disposal, all I ask  for is a invite to the event .  \n&gt;          If any one is interested you can contact me at\n&gt; shadow71414@... I will do my best to get back to you in 24\n&gt; hours. Or I am more than willing to give my cell number out and I do\n&gt; return calls promptly .\n&gt; \n&gt; Joel Collins\n&gt;"}
