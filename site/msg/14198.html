Who to go to?=A0 The scientific method!

This was a good example of how a c=
ouple people, with differing opinions but open minds, can follow an objecti=
ve methodology to root out the right answer.

1) Observation.=A0 We heard (=
indirectly) that someone has seen wave files experience lossy compression w=
hen sent through email clients.

2) Hypothesis.=A0 The theory is that the e=
mail client, and/or email servers, perform lossy compression on their attac=
hments for wave files.

3) Predictions.=A0 Based on this hypothesis, this s=
hould be observable by attaching and sending large waves files through some=
 email servers, and comparing both the originals, and the final files.=A0 I=
f original files and the final files should experience differences in conte=
nts.

4) Experiments.=A0 We sent different files, of different sizes, throu=
gh different clients and servers.=A0 

5) Analyze results.=A0 We compared t=
he originals at the byte level, and found no loss.

6) Interpret.=A0 No com=
pression was observed in our tests, and so no compression is being done wit=
h the servers and clients and environments in which we tested.=A0 This does=
 not make any claims about other tests or environments, but provides good t=
esting and predictions for what would be expected based on our tests.

With=
out this kind of method, we could have just gone back and forth giving subj=
ective or emotional arguments, with no real evidence.=A0 But following this=
 kind of method, we get to what we really both wanted: reliable interpretat=
ion of phenomenon.

And this doesn't mean we need to close the books foreve=
r.=A0 More prediction, more experiments, more results can be tried by more =
people, published, and reproduced.=A0 The body of knowledge then grows wide=
r, deeper, and more reliable.

This is why I push the scientific method eve=
n with EVP studies, even while others continue subjective or emotional argu=
ments: to improve the study, and to allow progress to be made by as many pe=
ople as possible.

      Yep, that's exactly what that =

                            if the files were=
 in the same ballpark.=A0 Look 
                            at it the other=
 way: if the number of bytes were 
                            DIFFERENT, t=
han you'd know the files HAD changed, 
                            and you =
could stop testing.=A0 But if the number 
                            of by=
tes are the same, it tends to indicate the 
                            fil=
es are likely the same, but you still need a low 
                         =
   level file comparison to be sure.

My method 
                          =
  is to compare the files using the CMP command in 
                       =
     unix.=A0 There are many programs to compare 
                         =
   files, but you have to be careful not to use one 
                      =
      that does a line-by-line compare (or a comparison 
                  =
          meant for text files), since text files can be 
                 =
           different at a low level, but look essential the 
              =
              same in an editor (because of the way spaces and 
           =
                 tabs and new lines work between editors and 
             =
               platforms).

But anyway, the way to compare is 
            =
                with a program that can compare binary files, not 
        =
                    text files.

      occurs during an email attachment is "lossless": 
                   =
             it compress the file cleverly without losing 
                =
                information.=A0 For example, if I had a 
                  =
              program in some .exe files, and I sent it over 
             =
                   email, it could compress it.=A0 But if it 
             =
                   lost even one bit, the resulting exe file would 
       =
                         not execute again after it was uncompressed on 
  =
                              the other side.

This kind of compression 
  =
                              does things like looking for common patterns =
in 
                                the file, and replacing them with a tok=
en.=A0 
                                A rough example would be if it foun=
d "Howdy 
                                Neighbor" in a file 20 times, it =
could replace 
                                all the occurances with say =
$HN1.=A0 And also 
                                write a little dictionar=
y in there someplace 
                                that says "$HN1=3DHow=
dy Neighbor".

When the 
                                file gets to its d=
estination it can be 
                                uncompressed, and all=
 occurences of $HN1 are 
                                replaced with "How=
dy Neighbor".=A0 So it was 
                                compressed (ins=
tead of 14 characters each, it 
                                only needed=
 4, plus the dictionary), but lost no 
                                data=
.

Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. 
                                are no=
t lossless.=A0 Depending on the level 
                                of c=
ompression, some level of data is lost, and 
                              =
  so cannot be recovered or reconstructed

 answer.<br><br>1) Observation.  We heard (indirectly) that someone ha=
s seen wave files experience lossy compression when sent through email clie=
nts.<br><br>2) Hypothesis.  The theory is that the email client, and/o=
r email servers, perform lossy compression on their attachments for wave fi=
les.<br><br>3) Predictions.  Based on this hypothesis, this should be =
observable by attaching and sending large waves files through some email se=
rvers, and comparing both the originals, and the final files.  If orig=
inal files and the final files should experience differences in contents.<b=
r><br>4) Experiments.  We sent different files, of different sizes,
 t=
hrough different clients and servers.  <br><br>5) Analyze results.&nbs=
p; We compared the originals at the byte level, and found no loss.<br><br>6=
) Interpret.  No compression was observed in our tests, and so no comp=
ression is being done with the servers and clients and environments in whic=
h we tested.  This does not make any claims about other tests or envir=
onments, but provides good testing and predictions for what would be expect=
ed based on our tests.<br><br>Without this kind of method, we could have ju=
st gone back and forth giving subjective or emotional arguments, with no re=
al evidence.  But following this kind of method, we get to what we rea=
lly both wanted: reliable interpretation of phenomenon.<br><br>And this doe=
sn't mean we need to close the books forever.  More prediction, more e=
xperiments, more results can be tried by more people, published, and reprod=
uced.  The body of knowledge then grows wider, deeper, and
 more relia=
ble.<br><br>This is why I push the scientific method even with EVP studies,=
 even while others continue subjective or emotional arguments: to improve t=
