<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi everyone,

I&#x27;m Katie, the founder of Fox Valley Spirit Hunters in Oshkosh WI.  I 
have developed a lot of interest in the audio/video aspect of 
investigating and was pleased to find this group.

I have a request.  I have been reading up on Frank&#x27;s box and the RS 
hack and have been curious to experiment with a gadget of this sort. 
However, I haven&#x27;t gone ahead until now, since I just unexpectedly 
found an older model 12-470 in our local RS store and snapped it up. 

What I need are written instructions (versus the video) for the 
modifications needed.  Unfortunately, hubby and I live in the stix and 
do not yet have high speed access. THe videos look wonderful but simply 
take far too long to download on dialup for us.

Is someone out there in possession of written instructions and would 
they be willing to share them?  I would really appreciate it.  Thx!</pre>
