Isn&#39;t the idea of posting files to \nget different theories on what is heard?  What are we comprehending \nin these or any other files anyway?  We are just starting to break \nground on full sentence answers, so we need to sift through them and \nmake sense.  That one about the earthquake is a great file, but what \ndoes it mean???  It doesn&#39;t make any sense, we have to make sense of \nthese files.  Whether it be in reverse, enhancing the audio or \nwhatever.  This is our job as researchers, while they laugh their \nass off on the other side watching us spend hours on the computer to \nsay there is going to be an earthquake somewhere that doesn&#39;t \nhappen.  If they say &quot;Steve likes cupcakes in a tree in east asia&quot;, \nthat&#39;s a great file and it will be clear.  But what would it mean \nand what effect will it have on humanity.\n\nNuff Said&#39;\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s the problem, get something that is not in human awareness \nto be recognized, heard, and comprehended. It&#39;s almost impossible. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Put your friends on the big screen with Windows Vista + Windows \nLive.\n&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/windows/shop/specialoffers.mspx?\nocid=TXT_TAGLM_CPC_MediaCtr_bigscreen_102007\n&gt;"}
