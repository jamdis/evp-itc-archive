&gt; Hi Frank.  Where&#x27;s the poloroid when you need it?!?  I bet the 
expression on the woman&#x27;s 
&gt; face was priceless when the RoboBox said &quot;Loves to cook.&quot;  :0)

&gt; &gt;  Well, I had a good time, did several talks, and--get this! An 
investigation. Or rather I 
&gt; kinda tagged along on a group&#x27;s investigation and used one of the 
boxes. There was 
&gt; entities answering questions, and responding tot he group members. 
I gave the group the 
&gt; tape, so I won&#x27;t be able able to play those. On my own recordings, 
the spirits were pretty 
&gt; the same as  get at home, and even my son come through wiht &quot;My 
father did this&quot;, which 
&gt; I played for a larger group. I loaned a box to another group, and 
they also got entities to 
&gt; answer questions, and interact. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  RoboBox did perform for a group, with at least one meaningful 
comment. A woman 
&gt; came to the table afte the talk, and asked &quot; Do they onokly talk 
for you&quot;&quot;, and immediately 
&gt; RoboBox put out &quot;for you&quot;, followed after a few seconds &quot;Loves to 
cook&quot;, the woman was a 
&gt; cook!
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  The whole thing is very energy intense.
