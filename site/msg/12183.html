Hi all;  I got a call, actually my wife got the call since I was at work, =
from a guy claiming he got my phone number from a 'hack' box. It could have=
 been fake, but--- I had on my dresser a portable tape deck with a session =
dated 08/03/08, and at the spot I stopped was this voice talking about 'Joh=
n (or jon)' calling. An example maybe of what I call "talk as if live", or =
voices on old tapes talking about the present moment. Weeeeeird!
 
 This st=
uff never ceases to amaze me.
