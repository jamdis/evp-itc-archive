However, I also acknowledge that \n&gt;   people here may have different callings/messages/uses other than \nwhat \n&gt;   I am hearing. I am going to just follow where the path before me \n&gt;   leads and try to find my role in it.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Personally, I think this needs to be in many people&#39;s hands. \nThat&#39;s \n&gt;   an interest of mine, too. Not sure yet how it will happen, but \nthe \n&gt;   radio hacks are a nice start. \n&gt; \n&gt;   LC\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%\n40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Robin Searcy Henson&quot; \n&gt;   &lt;MudPuddleFarm@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; I haven&#39;t started box recording yet. My impression of the EVP \nI&#39;ve \n&gt;   captured (which has been almost entirely obtained on the property \nI \n&gt;   moved to six years ago) is that someone is attached to this \nplace. \n&gt;   The first message was &quot;Here come some people,&quot; as I was hiking up \nthe \n&gt;   hill one day with my goats, then a kill-you threat in the house, \n&gt;   then &quot;get out of here&quot; in the barn. I assumed it must be one of \nthe \n&gt;   original owners, and I still feel that it&#39;s mainly one spirit \n&gt;   communicating that this is their home, not mine. I&#39;ve gotten one \n&gt;   uplifting message from what I believe to be the same entity, and \nthis \n&gt;   is also the last recording I&#39;ve gotten. I asked what death is \nlike, \n&gt;   compared to life: happy, beautiful, fulfilling--and specifically \nif \n&gt;   death is less depressing. The response was &quot;It&#39;s everything.&quot; \n&gt;   S/he/it basically stopped talking after that, and I stopped \ntrying. \n&gt;   I know this sounds weird, but I miss whoever or whatever it was. \nI \n&gt;   wonder if some of us might be better at dealing with the low-life \n&gt;   stuck or grounded entities rather than the highly evolved \ntechnicians \n&gt;   coming through the more sophisticated equipment. I wonder where \nthis \n&gt;   is all going ultimately, other than to prove communication across \nthe \n&gt;   veil is possible. I&#39;m not an engineer or technologist on this \n&gt;   physical plane, and I question what I have to offer this research \n&gt;   since I&#39;m so electronically challenged. Meanwhile, the nurse side \nof \n&gt;   me wants to heal and &quot;fix&quot; anyone needing help, even if they \nhappen \n&gt;   to be in the next world! Do the guides and technicians ever \n&gt;   acknowledge or make reference to the earthbound spirits, and if \nso, \n&gt;   in what context? Are we ever able to help unstick the stuck ones? \n&gt;   Are we supposed to ignore them? \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Robin\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   &gt; From: LC Duplatt&lt;mailto:lcdupla@&gt; \n&gt;   &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%\n40yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%\n40yahoogroups.com&gt;&gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Sent: Tuesday, January 29, 2008 3:32 AM\n&gt;   &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: EVP\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; EVP:\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Not that this is always the case, but EVP seems to primarily \n&gt;   capture \n&gt;   &gt; lost people - ghosts being recorded, versus the box having the \n&gt;   &gt; ability to capture primarily what seems to be higher \n&gt;   communication \n&gt;   &gt; from spirits, (and less of the lower communication - ghosts \n&gt;   jumping \n&gt;   &gt; in).\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; That to me is a huge difference... ;)\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; LC\n&gt;   &gt; \nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com&lt;http://www.angelsghosts.com/&gt;&lt;http://www.a\nngelsghosts.com/&lt;http://www.angelsghosts.com/&gt;&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%\n40yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%\n&gt;   40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;ecuyler&quot; &lt;ecuyler@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; I agree about the difference also.

The owner of this \nhome \n&gt;   &gt; asked if I\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed \nwith \n&gt;   the\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immediately 2 way communication). So upon respectfully \n&gt;   asking \n&gt;   &gt; my tec\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if it was alright to do a session outside the my home we \n&gt;   did \n&gt;   &gt; several\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box sessions along with conventional EVP. We wanted to \nsee \n&gt;   if \n&gt;   &gt; we could\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discover some unanswered history about the residence, and \n&gt;   the \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; otherside\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was more than willing to comply.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were \nand \n&gt;   are \n&gt;   &gt; the\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most boring data to review. Something I use to love so \nmuch \n&gt;   has\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually turned into a project given I am waiting for a \n&gt;   response\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immediately! Too funny how things can change overnight!\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will be uploading some files for these sessions if you \n&gt;   are \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Juli\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;"}
