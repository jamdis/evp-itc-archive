I hear you loud and clear...\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m just finishing up on another little research device\n&gt; I&#39;ll be \n&gt; sharing with the group before the day&#39;s out.\n&gt; It&#39;s similar to my last diode thing, just a slight bit\n&gt; different.\n&gt; I hope it works...\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike C.

I \n&gt; also \n&gt; &gt; remembered past issues. It&#39;s fine if you want to\n&gt; respond. In fact I \n&gt; &gt; think I have no right to deny you to do that. However\n&gt; I do have a \n&gt; right \n&gt; &gt; to keep you guys from duking it out HERE in this\n&gt; forum. It has been \n&gt; &gt; disrupted enough with the petty arguments. So find\n&gt; another place to \n&gt; &gt; have your word wars because most of the members here\n&gt; are NOT \n&gt; involved \n&gt; &gt; and should not be subjected to such displays of ego.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sorry but I have to deny your request for\n&gt; membership again. \n&gt; &gt; Normally I would email this to you personally but I\n&gt; want everyone \n&gt; here \n&gt; &gt; to know that this type of behavior is no longer\n&gt; tolerated. I just \n&gt; do \n&gt; &gt; not have time to be referee to peoples personal\n&gt; squabbles. So if \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; are here to research and learn then no problem. That\n&gt; is what this \n&gt; forum \n&gt; &gt; is for. If you are here just to be a negative\n&gt; influence then please \n&gt; &gt; take it somewhere else. This forum is not a battle\n&gt; ground. \n&gt; &gt; ________________\n&gt; &gt; Mike, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I understand why the conflict made you want to post\n&gt; here but again \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; is not the place for it. As I stated before most of\n&gt; the members \n&gt; here \n&gt; &gt; are not involved in this conflict and shouldnt have to\n&gt; be subjected \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; two grown men duking it out over something that they\n&gt; had no part in \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; even knew about. Most are here to learn and share and\n&gt; move forward. \n&gt; &gt; ________________\n&gt; &gt; Everyone Else,\n&gt; &gt; Up til now this has been a free posting forum and\n&gt; nobody has been \n&gt; &gt; moderated. However that could change so please rethink\n&gt; your actions \n&gt; &gt; before posting here. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So post it on your websites, start your own forums\n&gt; with your own \n&gt; rules \n&gt; &gt; that allow someone to be &quot;victorious&quot;. I see\n&gt; no victory in this for \n&gt; &gt; either side and having said that I wish you all well\n&gt; in your \n&gt; research. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Misty\n&gt; &gt;"}
