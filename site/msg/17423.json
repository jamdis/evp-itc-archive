How certain are you of what you\nsee and hear and don&#39;t see and hear? I think it comes down to that.\n\nPeople with a lot of uncertainty may claim things like &quot;pareidolia&quot; or\nwhatever, but if you have the certainty and confidence to say you hear this\nor that, then you really don&#39;t care.\n\nNo doubt some people DO fall pray to pareidolia (whatever that is) but I&#39;m\nnot one of them. I do have to wonder about the people who see &quot;orbs&quot; in\nevery photo but don&#39;t know enough about photography to say whether they may\nin fact be something uusual or not. I&#39;m not one of them.\n\nI think it&#39;s a good idea to put the audio clips up here for others to listen\nto. Others may hear something different. That doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re wrong in\nyour initial interpretation. You&#39;re free to agree with the other person and\nrevise what you say you hear. And you&#39;re free not to.\n\nDoes this make sense or do I need more coffee this morning?\n:-)\n\nZack\n\nOn Wed, Jun 2, 2010 at 9:00 AM, purplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...\n&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; That person is no longer allowed ot contribute! I&#39;ve had it with these\n&gt; nasty negative attacks when we present--at least to us--what seems to be\n&gt; evidence, and/or discuss various methods and techniques. These &quot;skeptics&quot;\n&gt; accept no evidence and basically call anyone doing this research either\n&gt; crazy or liars. They have no place on this group, this group is not about\n&gt; gettng accpetable evidence, or the &quot;proof&quot; that will play in some air head\n&gt; university, it&#39;s about exploring something that is real and demonstratable.\n&gt; I do think for myself and I don&#39;t need some duffus to tell me what is\n&gt; acceptable to think about.\n&gt;\n&gt; F-S\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Fiona Broome&quot;\n&gt; &lt;email@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It seems to me that simply being on this list and taking these\n&gt; discoveries seriously, we already ARE thinking for ourselves.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Seriously, why would anyone use/waste time on this subject (and this\n&gt; list) if he or she wanted the safety of accepted, mainstream, dogmatic\n&gt; thinking?
