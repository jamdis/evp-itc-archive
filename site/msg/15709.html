<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think predicting the future is something no one can do with certainty,
whether they be mediums, ghosts or spirit technicians. Maybe specific
details about things in the past are more what we&#x27;d be looking for, not
predictions of the future.

Maybe whoever sent those messages are just as subject to rumors about the
future as we are.

&gt;  I have gotten these bogus predicitons over and over, and couple that with
&gt; the fact I ask questions, and get lies--that&#x27;s enough! I can&#x27;t make this
&gt; crap, and I can&#x27;t provide something to people that I know that 90% of what
&gt; comes though is lies. You can&#x27;t prove the afterlife if none of the
&gt; information coming through any of these methods is reliable. Yes there is
&gt; something that talks that shouldn&#x27;t be there, and you can prove it&#x27;s not
&gt; radio fragments, or anything else earthly--but it still lies! It&#x27;s not
&gt; information, it&#x27;s useless garbage. I don&#x27;t care who you think you are, or
&gt; how smart you think you are, or how many &quot;right&quot; questions you know.  These
&gt; entites will lead you around by the nose till you wise up.
&gt;
&gt;  I have serious doubts about the Queen Mary thing, I think I&#x27;d have to side
&gt; with the debunkers on this BS. I don&#x27;t know what talks, but it ain&#x27;t your
&gt; Auntie Edna.
&gt;
&gt;  Went to RS and got enough supplies to finish the present projects and I&#x27;m
&gt; not making anymore, nor can I give any away knowing what I know about this
&gt; stuff.
