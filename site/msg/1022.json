Last night I tried it for the first time using the FM radio sweep. The optical microphone uses an oil lamp flame and a phototransistor, a very simple design. I had asked for some names in this session. Here are two clips from the session.\n\n&quot;Poncho and Cisco&quot;  I remember the TV show &#39;Cisco Kid&#39; from 50 plus years ago.\n&quot;Jorgesen liked a beer&quot; (or liked it here)\n\nDave\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n----__Part.20070403165236.A8909623\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg\r\nContent-Type: AUDIO/MPEG; name=&quot;040307systemisalittlecornyconceptisawesome.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;040307systemisalittlecornyconceptisawesome.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__Part.20070403165236.A8909623--"}
