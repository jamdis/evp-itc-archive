So the entities are 'spirits'?

Can you be more specific as to what you mea=
n by 'spirits'?

Maybe that also sounds like a dumb question, but I want to=
 make sure we're talking about the same thing.

      I =

I have at least three theories which=
 would cover both EVPs and Frank's box.  It seems that researchers will sel=
ect one theory as a "working theory" and thus build receivers that would op=
timize the effect.



In EVP we have at least two major theories.  In the E=
M (Electromagnetic) theory, we assume thatthe spirits are communicating wit=
h voice modulated EM waves--either via a kind of "radio technology" or the =
"fact" that sound waves from the other side are Electromagnetic relative to=
 our own universe.  This explains why we often need a device like a electri=
c sound recorder to hear the waves. 



The other major theory, and the one=
 I subscribe to, is that the voices are made from existing background sound=
s.  This is sorta like using an electronic larynix or holding an electric r=
azor to one's lips and "mouthing" words. The vocal appratus changes shape a=
nd resonance characteristics, making a sufficiently randomized sound(like a=
 buzzing razor) sound like words.  Spirits may do something similar, near a=
n EVP recording microphone, either "semi-manefesting" a vocal apparatus or =
by utilizing some of their own sound altering technology.



The third theo=
ry involves the listener putting the background noise together somewhat sel=
ectively- -in one's own mind, so to speak. The noise itself which forms whi=
ch is called a "random field"--- One of the "psychic levers" which effectiv=
ely enhances one's psychic abilities to useful levels.



Researchers will =
design their machines with one of these theories in mind.  FOr example, if =
theory two is chosen, the researcher will stress the production of an optim=
um sound/noise carrier wave that would work best for the proposed principle=
. 



If theory One is chosen the researcher would think in terms of radio =
frequencies.



ALL of these theories may be correct, so something designed=
 to exploit one effect might also work with other methods of EVP listening.=




I think Frank's box is being used to generate and develop an optimum BA=
CKGROUND noise that the spirits can use to modulate---whicheve r way they d=
o it.----Hey its called research--we are looking for answers we havent foun=
d yet.
