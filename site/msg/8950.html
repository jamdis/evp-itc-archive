          Hi Rees. I suppose if it's the old 12-469 (the one that doesn't click-click-click) that's a 
reasonable price, considering the units are no longer available commercially, and the old 12-
470's are very scarce. I haven't tried the 20-125 or the 12-820. I guess for $50, actually 
LESS than, one of these would be the way to go, since both are readily available. Perhaps the 
majority of people aren't yet aware that these other units are also hackable?
