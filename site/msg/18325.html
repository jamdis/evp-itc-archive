<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I make a separate folder for each set of files, e.g. &quot;Greenwood Cemetery
5-12-07&quot; and then put the files in the folder with numbers, e.g. &quot;001.mp3&quot;
or &quot;DSC0001.jpg&quot;. That way, the files do not have any distinctive name but
they are all organized.

&gt; I could, but it&#x27;s hard to keep track, i have hundreds of files on my pc,
&gt; and I have to write it down, i want to see if anyone else is able to hear
&gt; these few, I have other&#x27;s on this child too, with my voice, and his name and
&gt; stuff, but i didn&#x27;t want to post them, i hope he is found alive.  Spirit
&gt; say, he is over there in rest plane, with other spirit children, i guess he
&gt; is now in the spiritual baby land.  sf

&gt;    When you label the files with what you heard, you influence the
&gt; listener to try to hear what you heard, rather than what they hear with no
&gt; hints.  So if you want to know what people really hear without your hints,
&gt; you need to send them out unlabeled.

&gt; If there is a chance you might be able to stop this Morgan person from
&gt; hurting another child, you must call now.   Waiting so that you don&#x27;t look
&gt; wrong or silly is not the priority here: there are more important things on
&gt; the line than personal ego (I hope).

&gt;  No, and no, this is a younger child, recently missing, I have not called
&gt; yet, I want to see if anyone can hear what I am hearing yet before I let
&gt; them know.  I got names, and the little guy, I think said &quot;hi&quot; to me.  At
&gt; this point no one else is able to hear my files, so I won&#x27;t do a thing until
&gt; i get validation from the so-called living first. sf

&gt;  Do you mean the missing 7-year-old Oregon boy named Kyron Horman?
&gt;
&gt; Have you told the police that Morgan has him? Have you told them what you
&gt; know?
