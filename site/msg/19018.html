Thanks for the link.  That is exactly what I was talking about.  The last
time I checked, the results had not been posted.  No surprise here, they
rules GB out.  But, their fallacy was that they were trying to condense GB
communication into terms of EVP which in my opinion cannot be done.  They
are two distinctly different forms of communication.

I find it quite amusing that they surmised that GB technology does not work
based upon a few select files based off of one user using one box.  How
ridiculous, not to mention limiting, is that?  If they wanted to actually
conduct a study, it should have been with ghost box users who have a
relationship with the other side.  Or at the very least, invited ghost box
users to listen to their meager file selection in order to contribute.

Oh well.  Those of us who use the boxes know that it works and that is all
that matters.  I did a public demonstration of ghost boxes last night during
a fund raising event (using a minibox plus and a Joe&#x27;s box) that left over
400 people convinced (including members of a different ghost group) that
there was something to this.  Jaws were dropping as my name was called out,
soldiers names were called out, and even the name of a general who was at
the Fort we did the benefit for.

So despite the efforts of groups like ATC to put GB down, ghost boxes will
catch on.

&gt; I, too, saw the &quot;guess my line&quot; (i.e. guess the secret object) experiment
&gt; on the ITC web site as well and also thought of someone else who used to be
&gt; on this group. I suspect he may possibly have gotten that idea from this web
&gt; site?
&gt;
&gt; In any case, I did find this article on the ITC web site discrediting or
&gt; debunking or whatever the proper term is for EVP&#x27;s via radio sweep. Perhaps
&gt; this is what you are referring to?

&gt; I read on the Butlers ATC site a few months back that they had a

&gt; results from an early experiment? I just went to their site and couldn&#x27;t
&gt; find mention of it, but right on their homepage there was this:
&gt; &gt; &quot;Everyone is invited to use EVPmaker to name the secret object.&quot;
&gt; &gt; Sounds familiar, huh? I wonder if RJ is part of their group.
