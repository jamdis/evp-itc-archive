<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Any serious student and researcher of EVP knows that VERY VERY controlled studies of the EVP phenomenon go back at least 30 years to the first Pye Recording Studio Tests that where originally set up and paid for by and Editor of a newspaper covering the phenomenon. The editor was NOT in any way convinced that EVP was real... Independent sound engineers from Pye were brought in... the result? Voices... hundreds of them... Ultimately result? The paper didn&#x27;t release the result anyway...

There was also a very controlled experiment done in a Faraday Cage... and if memory serves was mentioned in the Journal for the American Psychical Society.

The point I&#x27;m trying to make here is that VERY controlled experiments are not new in this arena... 

I&#x27;ve been involved in the area of EVP for well over a decade now... I don&#x27;t wish to convinced anyone of anything thats tantamount to a damned religious conversion...

Hans Holzer summed it up well... &quot;The will to disbelieve is greater than the will to believe.&quot;

As researchers, many of us have moved well beyond the question of:   Do they (the voices) exist?&quot;... Many of us are now asking: &quot;What does it all mean?&quot; in a more spiritual context...

The group that recieved the grant I suspect are themselves members of the AA-EVP group at large. I recognize at LEAST 3 members from the consciousness studies dept (the former) at the University of Arizona as well who have now formed this (in my opinion) new agey group studying human potential... Very 70&#x27;s at first glance...
