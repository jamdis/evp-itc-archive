=A0 
Just an AM/FM clock radio one of the g=
uys gave me here at work. I have to use the FM here cuz not much gets throu=
gh the concrete walls for AM. You can tune a radio in between stations too,=
 or even use a short wave, tuning in a foreign language you don't understan=
d and announce you're doing an EVP recording. Some entities will use that a=
s raw audio and when the recording is played back there will( it's not 100%=
) be english messages mixed in with the foreign language. That's how I got =
the message "you are the woman who comes from stars" on
http://purplealieng=
 irl.tripod. com/ 

I use anything that provides the raw audio. It's not th=
e box, it's a combination of user and method, the method being raw audio.
