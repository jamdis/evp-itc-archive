&gt; Bravo, I&#x27;m sure we all can&#x27;t wait for the details. I know I can&#x27;t.
&gt;  
&gt; they say necessity is the mother of invention
&gt; and finding a readily available source of hackable radios
&gt; was definitely necessary. You have just rekindled 
&gt; the hopes of quite a few aspiring researchers that have 
&gt; had no venue to get a box. without the inherent clicking that the 
&gt; new model 12-469 has after hacking.
&gt;  
&gt; great work !

&gt; I was bored on my day off today and picked up a radio and figured 
out the hack for it. It took me maybe 5 minutes or less. It has AM/FM 
and Shortwave. It also has a built in speaker and it was $39, so 
anyone that is having trouble finding the old style 12-469 and 12-470 
here is another model that is readily accessible. E-mail me privately 
for details, i have to run at the moment and can&#x27;t get into the hack. 
But i will post the specifics when i get home. I&#x27;m actually proud of 
myself for figuring it out and not breaking it in the process.-Steve
