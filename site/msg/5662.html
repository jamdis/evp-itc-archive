<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s a box that you can ony see at night! 


 Just kidding!

 It&#x27;s a swept radio with amplifiers to drive a speaker with the radio 
audio, there&#x27;s mic amps to pick up the resulting audio, usually from 
a sound chamber, then provide a line level output to a recorder, and 
monitor speaker. 

 It&#x27;s a method of  supplying raw audio that spirits/entites can use 
to form their voices, resulting in much louder EVP type recordings. 
and consistent spirit contacts. it&#x27;s possible to get two way 
communication, and question/answers, although I rarely ask questions.

 It was kind of an analog version of EVPmaker. After I had many 
messages relayed from spirits that couldn&#x27;t use the computer, I was 
thinking about what else I could use and came up with the ghost box.

&gt; &gt; Hey Gabreael,
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; The file you posted and randy cleaned up for you has been way way 
&gt; over processed with the audio editer.
&gt; &gt; send me the file and I&#x27;ll go over it for you.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Randy no disrespect intended.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I uploaded my first Ghost Box recording to my EVP file today. I 
&gt; used the same process cleaning it up with Audobe Audition I use 
with 
&gt; my EVP&#x27;s but it seems to need more. Does anyone have Audobe 
Audition 
&gt; advice for cleaning up that radio static?Gab
