We have so many radio \nstations in SE Florida. We have Florida, Cuba, Haiti and all those \nother Islands, that there is little breaks on the F.M. and A.M. \nstations. \n\nI use the hack with a mixer, digital recorder (sometimes straight to \ncomputer), and microphone. When I first did the hack, before taping \nmy sessions, I did make contact with a Tech called &quot;Frank&quot;. I know \nit&#39;s not Frank S, but my father, who passed 2 years ago is a Frank as \nwell, I had to ask if he was Francis Joseph Carr, reply was no. I got \nso freaked that I closed the portal. Later that day, I tried again, \ngot a tech who said his name was Reed. I wanted to test the system bc \nI wasn&#39;t believing my ears, so I asked him to read a name I was \nwriting on a piece of paper. As I was writing my name, John, he said \nit before I got to complete the &quot;n&quot;. I got no nervous, I asked to \nclose the portal, and wait till it was clear, then shut down.\n\n The next day, I set up to record my session, which it didn&#39;t go as \nwell. So much radio signals, that I could hear the tech. I kept on \nasking, &quot;Can you repeat your name?&quot;, and I got fustrated with all the \nsounds coming from the RS 470. I know, if I was on the other side \nthat I would have been pissed. Upon listening to the recording, I \nfound out his name was Pete. When I asked to repeat, he said, &quot;I \nDid&quot;. I asked for a test of the systems, he said, &quot;maybe&quot;. I asked to \nrepeat &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, I heard, very weak, &quot;ragon...fly&quot;.\n\nI&#39;ve been doing investigations in haunted invironments since 1998. I \ndo EVPs with digital recorders in the haunted area. This RS Hack is \nbeing done in my home, which isn&#39;t haunted, except if you call my \nfather&#39;s visits a haunt, which I don&#39;t. On the time of first session \nafter the hack, I heard my wall start to make a sound like there was \nmoving furniture behind the wall. I went to look, nothing was moving. \nLooked outside, nothing outside. \n\nI know about closing the portal and asking everyone to leave and give \nthem a chance to go through. Can a spirit stay if they want to, even \nthough you don&#39;t? Does techs get pissed off when our side doesn&#39;t \nhear well? Is there a way to squelch the stations that are coming \nthrough, I hear everyone elses sessions and they are less noisey than \nmine, can I reduce the noise? \n\nI&#39;m not a electrical tech, and a definately not as talented as Frank \nSumption, which I regard as expert in this new technology. I do have \npassion though, and hope my efforts will help those on the otherside \nand our side figure out a way to get some serious applications done. \n\nMany of the EVPs I get are, &quot;Help Me&quot;, which saddens me. I have an \ninvestigation coming up soon, where a fireman was killed on his \nsecond week of working at the firestation. He died in 1940. His \naccident, might have not been an accident. Upon going to a fire, we \nfell into a puddle that had a downed wire. He died minutes later and \nnow haunts the firestation. Some Clairvoyants think he was pushed out \nof the truck into the puddle as a joke, since he was new. They didn&#39;t \nknow about the wire. \n\nI would love to use the RS Hack, but afraid that people would think \nI&#39;m crazy, that I&#39;m only finding words to match what I want to hear.\nI hear ya&#39;lls session and mine are, well, just have too much stuff in \nthe background.\n\nAm I going crazy?\n\nJohn Marc Carr\nwww.sefgr.com"}
