Hi again Steve
   
  Ok I got a chance to listen to a few of those for ya. Let me start off by saying I think what the recorder/medium hears is more meaningful but I hear some of those different.
   
  oak1= 50's near to 60"
  oak2 = "cant produce its one percent"
  oak5= jefferson (overlapping your voice) thomas (really cool btw)
   
  I'll check out some more later =)

This is simple FM design built for me. I'm still testing it out and 
would like to get everyone's feedback on this radio. I have posted 
mp3's in the file section from a quick EVP test i did today. If 
anyone has any feedback please let me know what you think.

Thanx,
-Steve
