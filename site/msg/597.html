Your welcome Bill. I uploaded a few more that I did the night before then I had to go to work before I could finish adding details. I had a few of a friend that I recognized and a few that were very clear but I have no clue who they are. One was a sequence of shot of a little boy in a cowboy hat with what appeared to be other entities sitting in the background. He was lit up completely so much so that you could only see his face partially in one dark moment. I might go back and reanalyze that one to see if I can get anything I missed. I tried to get the images but its easier to see some things in video mode. A couple of the clips I got of it were pretty good.
   
  I cant say that the crystal method is better than my other method but it just really fascinates me how different it is. The other method I usually have to wait until I view it frame by frame to see whats been recorded. But using the crystal I sit here and am amazed how much I view as it happens. You literally see the shift in the face of the crystal on screen and then all sorts of images start to broadcast. Flashing light over the crystal seems to bring on the shift change.
