I want to take my time with this.  For my own\nunderstanding, I need to have a large sample size so I know not only what to\nexpect to see, but what to look for.  I have seen ITC snapshots from\nprograms like this that offer full faces.  I would be more inclined to\nbelieve in such an image as opposed to, lets say. two dark lines that may or\nmay not be eyebrows.\n\nEven in your example of the towel, you get half a face.  If you have half a\nface (on the vertical plane, not the horizontal) you can extrapolate out\nwhat the entire face would look like.  This is something I would like to get\nmyself and I would consider that evidence if it showed up in one of these\nprograms.  But, if you have something that looks like a forehead and that is\nall there is, then it could also look like a rock or some other such object.\n\nI am certainly hoping for results worked into box sessions.  Directing a\nsession with intent, like saying &quot;I am going to examine the sound waves of\nthis communication in hopes of seeing your face.  Is it possible you can\nshow your face to me now through sound? &quot; is what I am after.  If a positive\nhit like this happens, then I will be jumping for joy.  Another good example\nwould be a name, lets say Tom, that occurs.  If you get a positive\naffirmation that the name you heard is present, then you try the same\ntechnique only you address Tom by name and get a face, that would be even\nbetter.\n\nBut, as it stands now, the faces as they appear are random at best.  I would\nbe more inclined to believe that when these faces do occur , they are going\nto occur with a lesser frequency than multiple images in a few seconds of\naudio like Ursula&#39;s example.  If this where the case, there would be dozens,\nand possibly hundreds, of faces during a ten minute session and I just don&#39;t\nthink that is possible.  This is why I need to look at several samples to\nfind out if this is the case or not.  If these partialized faces occur in\nmultiples all the time, I would be more apt to discount it.  But, if they\nare a rarity affixed to only a few clips out of dozens, I would be more\ninclined to believe in them.  Sample size is everything.  It is like\nlistening to GBC.  If you have never done a session before, you would be\ninclined to believe every stray radio signal is a communication.  Only by\ncontinued practice (expanding your sample size) can you start to rule out\nstray radio with any degree of accuracy.\n\nOn the other hand, I am very new to this and I could certainly be wrong.  I\nwill continue to plug sound into the programs and hope for the best.\n\nI really want this to work.  As you have probably experienced, when they\nwant you to hear something or know something, they make it very obvious\nwhile communicating.  I am hoping they apply this same rigor to this new\nformat to show us that they are there.  If they can, then the world of video\nand audio ITC will merge in one source and then the skeptics be damned!\n\nTim\n\nOn Sat, Dec 18, 2010 at 2:24 PM, Frank Sumption\n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  I think it&#39;s unrealistic to expect every file to have faces and images.\n&gt; These faces are often just portions, eyes and lips, some have eye brows.\n&gt; Like all of this, not done for proof, it&#39;s for emotional impact.  I have\n&gt; this woman that shows up in towels, always just half the face. Perahps you\n&gt; are being too critical? As with all spirit messages, it&#39;s what it means to\n&gt; the experiencer that matters. Expecting full faces is like expecting the\n&gt; kings english and proper grammer in all EVPs.\n&gt;\n&gt; F-S\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Dec 18, 2010 at 3:07 AM, Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I saw a couple which could be construed as images in the one series you\n&gt;&gt; had from SEA, but nothing that knocked me over the head yet.  I am going to\n&gt;&gt; have to see a larger sample size before I determine if what you have\n&gt;&gt; witnessed is in fact a form or not.  I cannot accept an image as paranormal\n&gt;&gt; without knowing where it sits among the bulk of audio files.  If every file\n&gt;&gt; has multiple faces, the I would have  to say that there is nothing there.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So, I will certainly keep testing with my copy and hopefully something\n&gt;&gt; will really pop for me.  I have run through about ten files (EVP and GBC) so\n&gt;&gt; far for intensive study and I still haven&#39;t got anything that I would\n&gt;&gt; consider a positive hit.  I need an actual formed face, not portions\n&gt;&gt; thereof, to consider an image real.  This is the only way to discount visual\n&gt;&gt; matrixing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have high hopes for this though!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tim\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Sat, Dec 18, 2010 at 5:01 AM, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   Tim did you see my images???\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- On *Sat, 12/18/10, Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: ok so im getting stuff on the spectergram\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Saturday, December 18, 2010, 3:26 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I have Audition as my editor.

It was really compelling to see letters and numbers,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; not images or pictures, but partial words appear in the graph. At first it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; was I thought it was a software glitch but it is a repeatable event. It was\n&gt;&gt;&gt; on LiveSciFi which is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was some kind\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of code error but it happened on more than one webcast.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; So if anyone has Audition, just feed Box output right in your computer\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and see what happens. I wanted to try it tonight but I have Audacity and the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; spectragraph feature doesn&#39;t have that shaded appearance that Audition does\n&gt;&gt;&gt; so it&#39;s not able to render images or characters, at least as far as I see\n&gt;&gt;&gt; using the various settings.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I have tried numerous EVP files and short box clips and so far\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; nothing discernible has appeared on either program.
