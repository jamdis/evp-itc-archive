Here are a few from the sessions I did today. Some involved musical background noise hubby had playin loud (spirit in the sky was the song so I pressed record to see what I'd get LOL) then later did a session with the usual water/fan bg noise.
   
  All in all I pulled out 34 or so evp's. Some were pretty clear for me, some were fuzzy as usual. It was a pretty good connection, I asked questions and they answered. Not going to post what I asked, nor am I going to post all the answers I got but I will share some of what came thru.
   
  Theres even one directed at you evp listeners.. for those who can hear it. They sound alot better in wav format, mp3 is smaller in file size but it does lose some clarity sometimes.
   
  I had to laugh at the be silent one... I usually ask questions in my head but today I started a session off talking aloud. Something I dont usually do because it opens the door for all to hear and reply. Luckily I only had 2 strays pop in, but all one had to say was "i invented the electric current" and "im passed away" it was a little strange LOL and left me rackin my brain trying to figure out who it was because theres several scientists who I could fit into that category. Whether it was a partycrasher or the real thing...I have no clue. 
   
  There was also someone talking about "im not able to do the accent" and then the guide saying to them "thats fine ok keep moving" then he says "i used to have a touch of an english accent, pretty good i hope" 
   
  LOL
   
  I may post those later if anyone wants to hear them they are a little fuzzy on some words.
