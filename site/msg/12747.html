 I know, doesn't fit the latest ghost hunting theories, and it has been po=
or at attracking the lime lights, but here it is. 
 
 I have played with th=
e idea of adding in a tone to act as a foundation for the ghost voices in t=
he boxes, it seems to works.the first example is on my site, http://purplea=
liengirl.tripod.com/ , noted which one it it there. The second attempt was =
wiht box 24, but the tuner was som noisy I kinda gave up on that box. 
 
 I=
n this test I used two tones, guessing, about 800hz, and around 1khz. The t=
ones are mixed with the radio audio. The exact frequency is not all the imp=
ortant, as these are square waves, which contain all harmonics. This is man=
ual sweep only, the sweep circuit is not build yet. 
 
 My approach is test=
ing and developing, I don't try to sell this stuff at this point, and I can=
't make boxes for very many requesters, I just don't have the time. I've sa=
id it a thousand times, the box is not the only method, there are many rela=
ted methods of using raw audio. This group has turned into more of a ghost =
hunters group, something I don't agree with.
