<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

I&#x27;m amazed when anyone claims they can&#x27;t clearly hear the voices.  Okay, so far my only experience has been listening to Chris Moon&#x27;s sessions in Canada, and the recordings posted here.

What I hadn&#x27;t expected were consistent voices.  Oh, I&#x27;d heard some &quot;Shack Hack&quot; recordings with one word in a female voice, another word sung, a third word in a male voice, and so on.  That didn&#x27;t impress me.

My experiences with Chris&#x27; work startled me. Your recordings astonish and impress me.  

(Not just yours, Frank, but many of the recordings posted to this list.  I&#x27;ve been listening in my spare time, trying to wrap my brain around how well this works, and how I&#x27;ve been totally missing the boat with this stuff, for years.)

I&#x27;m hearing consistent voices, consistent accents, consistent speech patterns.

Regularly, I have to debate so-called authorities who want to be the best/only &quot;experts&quot; in the paranormal field. (That&#x27;s one of the perils of appearing on panels at events.)

Someone else in the field aptly described the self-proclaimed authorities as a bunch of junkyard dogs fighting over a chewed-over bone.

Well, maybe that&#x27;s an insult to junkyard dogs, now that I think about it.

My point is: A whole lot of what I see at paranormal events is about status and politics.  I&#x27;m not interested in that.  I&#x27;m interested in results.

Results are what I&#x27;m seeing on this list.  That&#x27;s what matters.

Keep doing what you&#x27;re doing. This is important.

Sincerely,
Fiona
