<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>speaker as mike--got voice on first try .  male, american 
sounding &quot;thank you&quot;  that was it

carbon mic without dc bias -no result

diode- no result


all rhe above on analogue tape recorder designed for voice 
recording , memos.  from radio shack


diode presumed to need preamp just tried it anyway.

&gt; you guys all stay up later than i do.
&gt; 
&gt; i tried an old carbon granule element from 1950s era telephone and 
it 
&gt; sure makes a good white noise source when dc biased.  plugged it 
into 
&gt; analog recorder .  also functions as low gain parametric amp ala 
&gt; nathan stubblefield.  since this is almost morning for me i guess i 
&gt; will set up speaker-mic recorder now.
&gt; 
&gt; impedance mismatch for backward audio transformer was not too bad 
for 
&gt; lower voice frequencies.  giving serious thought to using auto 
&gt; ignition coil as earth-to-beyond input impedance matcher.
&gt; 
&gt; tried it before but everybody complained voices sounded like CB 
radio 
&gt; voices.

&gt; &gt; I have experimented with music and a series of filters in a 
closed 
&gt; system. I will post an example that first plays the source and then 
&gt; the filtered result which contains a message. The message I hear 
&gt; is &quot;The filters on, give us some babbling&quot; They prefer babble over 
&gt; music but I find them much easier to pick out in an all music 
passage.

&gt; &gt; music is as far away from white noise as you can get.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; there are no voice fragments for entities to manipulate
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; voice voltage is being added to voltage of music which acts as 
&gt; &gt; carrier, via some inductor or nonlinear element near input.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; audio transformer turned backwards connected to input with large 
&gt; &gt; speaker on8 ohm side and put at bottom of sound confining 
container 
&gt; &gt; like plastic garbage can  would eliminate hit-or-miss voltage 
&gt; &gt; superposition.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; use a speaker for the microphone at bottom of wastebasket  hook 
to 
&gt; &gt; low side of audio transformer.  voices could be about 20 times 
&gt; louder
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; going to try it myself asap..speaker as microphone

&gt; &gt; &gt; I know they like to use music. In particular they can make use 
of 
&gt; &gt; certain instruments to propel thier voice across. So last night I 
&gt; &gt; played a short clip of Joe Satriani&#x27;s &quot;always with you always 
with 
&gt; &gt; me&quot; it contains music only, no vocals. I discovered that in the 
&gt; first 
&gt; &gt; few seconds of the clip the voices were able to sustain a loud, 
&gt; &gt; comprehensive line of communication until Satriani kicked it into 
&gt; &gt; high gear and the guitar notes were too loud and drowned 
everything 
&gt; &gt; out. Some could be heard on regular playback, most could be heard 
&gt; &gt; clearer at a slowed down rate of -74% &amp; -30%. I then did a 
session 
&gt; &gt; with no music. Both sessions lasted under 1 minute and both 
&gt; sessions 
&gt; &gt; had a yeild of about 18 clips/sentences. The difference being 
that 
&gt; &gt; more of the music clips were louder and clearer to understand for 
&gt; me 
&gt; &gt; and hopefully for you too. 
&gt; &gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Heres a few of the evp clips for you to download and 
evaluate. 
&gt; &gt; Many are very loud so I recommend you lower the sound DOWN... 
ALOT 
&gt; &gt; til you play it once to see what volume level it has. I use 
stereo 
&gt; &gt; speakers so I am used to blasting my head off LOL so careful you 
&gt; dont 
&gt; &gt; blow a speaker or your eardrums. Even I usually turn them down 
&gt; &gt; because the level of vibration and noise may be too much for my 
&gt; dogs 
&gt; &gt; ears. The process I used was the same, p1 filter only, amped at 
+15 
&gt; &gt; which works differently depending on what comes across and what I 
&gt; &gt; used for background sound. When using music the noise level is 
&gt; &gt; definitely alot higher and you will need to lower your sound for 
&gt; &gt; those LOL
&gt; &gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Only sharing some of the ones I think others can hear. The 
&gt; music 
&gt; &gt; session had alot more than the nonmusic session. I will send a 
&gt; short 
&gt; &gt; clip of satriani (the first part where the voices were the best) 
so 
&gt; &gt; that if anyone wants to give it a try they can.
