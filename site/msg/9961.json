As anyone who has been experimenting with these methods can tell\nyou, not all phrases and statements are heard exactly alike by each\nperson. That &quot;garbage&quot; as you call it can be a word heard by someone\nelse that does make since in the grander message.\n\n2. By editing the message and guessing as to what the entity is trying\nto say, you are in a since saying you know exactly what they meant in\ntheir communication. It is better to ask for a clearer response to\nyour question than to mold the answer you get into an answer you want.\n\nNo matter how you argue this subject, I always hear more logical\narguments from those against the practice. I&#39;m sure there are many\nmore points to be made as to why this is a bad idea but these are my\ntwo big ones.\n\nRegards,\n\nFrank R.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday\n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ron,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Excellent, see you got the point immediatelly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: ronriko@...: Thu, 17 Apr 2008 09:35:30\n-0700Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce    To add to what you said, the capacity of the yahoo forum we\nare with does not permit long recordings and the messages we have been\nreceiving seem to be getting longer and longer each passing month. \nNot much room for the &quot;gargage.&quot;  I for one prefer to hear the\nimportant message words, knowing full well the author edited the file.\n If someone wants to present false stuff so that he or she gets false\npraise from us,  god bless them if they need the praise.  For\nscientific research with original files...that&#39;s another story.

At this point in my\nresearch, the message is more important to me than the proof of it.I\nthink most of us here will agree that we are receiving some sort of\nparanormal communication.but it definitely exists. now we need to\nconcentrate on the messages they need us to hear and the answers to\nthe questionswe ask and in turn our answers to their questions. Anyone\nthat cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the\nfilethat has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously\ngarbage like the &quot;EH O EH AH O EH UR&quot; in between words. For example\n&quot;Is there anyone here that wishes to communicate_YES_AH ER EEH AR OOO\nAR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE&quot;It is much easier for me as a researcher\nto be able to return to a file that I recieved two weeks ago and that\nI believe may hold somerelivence to a message I just received and be\nable to cleanly listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage\nsounds. At this stage in real time communication the messages are the\ntop priority.I do however agree that the untouched version should be\nretained and made available to individuals that make a request for any\nintelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may be made, and\ngod knows there are always fanatical sceptics lurking in the shadows\nawaiting an opportunity to attack an unwary or injured researcher. I\ndo not think that our research files should be made available on\nrequest by every tom dick and harry that is unknown to us and may\npotentiallydoctor the file to suit their own point and post it as\nsuch. I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the\nresearcher that receives the request for raw research data should\nscrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment before\nhanding out any research data. These are my thoughts on the subject of\ncleaning a file.

You can forinstance increase the volume or dynamics of\nan entire clip (includingthe experimenter&#39;s voice), filter or denoise\nit to make it clearer, butnot cut out individual pieces (supposed\n&quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP matchwith what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the\nunedited version should alwaysbe provided along with the edited\nversion.But that&#39;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to\nexpress, aswe should always be able to present our results to a\ncritical public.Stefan-- &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is\ninvolved for these files.&gt; After my question, i isolate the response\nsection and slow that &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually\nstart to hear the message &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple\nsections of just noise that &gt; don&#39;t belong and eliminate them from the\nmix. You can&#39;t piece these &gt; files together to make something it&#39;s\nnot, so i keep them in true &gt; form pretty much to the original.&gt;\n-Steve&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@&gt;\nwrote:&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey Steve Forgot to ask...how much editing was needed to\nget this &gt; file?
