Yeah...but there are places that certain entities prefer to stay at, and ma=
ybe "stuck" due to their own personal problems. I go to haunted places to i=
ncrease my chances of getting real, huge evidence.

I do think that some gh=
osts can come a go as they wish, but I think there are some that refuse to =
realize they have the ability to do so too.

   I hear that! I think many of them out there ar=
e used to going to the supposed haunted location to get their messages out.=
 It's my contention that the entites travel, and will come to you when you =
dojm EVP sessions. As such, there isn't really a haunted location, I think =
they are a show for the living, a way of showing that spirit exists in a pl=
ace that isn't in your house, something many are affraid of.
