<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>If I don&#x27;t get an e-mail link to the file, I usually don&#x27;t go there  
on my own at that time. I&#x27;d rather see individual announcements per  
file.

&gt; Yesterday I decided to post some files so I posted to a sub folder of
&gt; my main folder in the files section.
&gt; I noticed that some people voiced their dislike of sending post  
&gt; notices
&gt; for every file , so I sent none. Just a single post stating that I had
&gt; posted the files and where they could be found.
&gt;
&gt; Now this is the dilemma, If you do not post an announcement for each
&gt; file and you trust that the single post announcing all the files that
&gt; have been posted will suffice, well I don&#x27;t think so!
&gt;
&gt; I know that most individuals here do not listen to or reply to every
&gt; single file posted but I will usually get some comments on the better
&gt; or more interesting ones. So far from the posting yesterday &quot;NADA&quot;
&gt;
&gt; If anyone saw the post I wrote announcing the files I posted to the
&gt; files section, please for my own satisfaction let me know.
&gt;
&gt; Otherwise I don&#x27;t think the one post notice thing is gonna cut it!
