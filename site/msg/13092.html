That sounds like an extremely important discovery, L=

If you have found that recorders are sensitive to some radio
frequen=
cies, and those recorders and those frequencies have not been
well tested o=
r documented, then potentially some recorders are also
senstive to normal A=
M/FM, as well as other frequencies. This should
bring into serious question=
 any EVPs people have gotten, unless they
know those sensitivies beforehand=
