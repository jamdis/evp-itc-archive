<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>They tell me, and I have heard from a sister on the other side I 
have never met, named Betty. They even said she took our old cat when 
he disappeared. I also have some friends from past lives, one is Otto.

 BTW, I wasn&#x27;t able to listen to anyone&#x27;s files tonight, I&#x27;m 
uploading videos to You tube, and that almost takes all the band 
width.

&gt; I was thinking tonight as Frank S. welcomed some of our new comers 
to 
&gt; the group if in fact anyone during a box session inquired to the 
names 
&gt; in which the other side call us?
&gt; 
&gt; For instance Frank has been addressed as princess, and I know I 
have 
&gt; gotten a spirit stating he was my brother (I am an only child).  I 
am 
&gt; curious as to whether or not this could in fact be affilated with a 
&gt; past or former life.  That at one time Frank S. could have been of 
&gt; royality and I could in fact have had siblings.
&gt; 
&gt; How far fetched is it that we could be actually talking to spirits 
we 
&gt; once had a relationship with or if that is even possible.
&gt; 
&gt; I would welcome any imput on my wild and crazy thoughts!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
