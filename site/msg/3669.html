<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think we should all focus at the research at hand and forget what 
everyone else is doing.  I personally know Chris and think he&#x27;s a 
great guy and frank feels the same way most days.  This has gotten 
to the point where i can&#x27;t even do a session anymore because i&#x27;m so 
blocked by negative thoughts from this group it&#x27;s pointless to 
concentrate on the box and get results.  Honestly who cares what 
chris does anyway, does it really affect everyone&#x27;s lives that 
much.  I have a job and this is a hobby that i used to really like, 
but now this board has brought me down.  It seems all people want to 
do is make this like a street fight with challenges and negative 
views and for what reason?  If anyone is concerned about hearing 
Chris&#x27;s audio, i have about 2 hours of box sessions from Eastern 
State on my web site for all to listen to.  It&#x27;s 
www.keyportparanormal.com and go to investigation and click on 
eastern state.  All the audio is at the bottom of that page and you 
guys can judge for yourself and i heard a lot come out of that box 
that night personally because i repeated a lot of stuff back to 
chris that i heard.  Enough already, let&#x27;s move on to the next great 
thing.  That radio shack hack was a great breakthrough here, let&#x27;s 
just be happy we got that before it was shut down.  Now we have 
another avenue to go down, but we can&#x27;t do it with all these 
negatives out there.  Let&#x27;s move on to new topics and anyone out 
there that bought a Radio Shack box, start sharing your files with 
the group so it&#x27;s not just us same 5 that post all the time.
