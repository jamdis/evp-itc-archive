<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ok, i listened.  Please do not get mad at me, i want to be honest.  I heard a couple of words here and there, but nothing i could make out clearly.  

The recording was really bad, i couldn&#x27;t even tell that it was a box that i was listening to.  It sounded like you were under water and the file was over processed to death.

I know you didn&#x27;t over process it, so it was probably just a bad recording.  Try again when you get that new recorder, it really does make a difference to the people who listen to the files.

I&#x27;m sorry i could not make anything out, but i&#x27;m sure it was a great session.  I just wanted to be honest about what i heard on my end.

-Steve

&gt; &gt; That&#x27;s because there was nothing there to hear, no big deal. It&#x27;s just one file, there are others to listen to.

&gt; &gt; &gt; he still can&#x27;t hear it, sf

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ll have to check out the original file, i only listened to the one Snow 
&gt; &gt; &gt; posted. It sounded like it was under water, i heard no recognizable box 
&gt; &gt; &gt; sweep. I honestly thought it was a traditional evp recording, i couldn&#x27;t make 
&gt; &gt; &gt; out any words in the clip it was just noise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as you can see nothing has been done to this file...I don&#x27;t know what 
&gt; &gt; &gt; snow did to the part she sent me..I don&#x27;t do anything to my files..I have 
&gt; &gt; &gt; been told this is the clearest real time some have ever heard..this is a real 
&gt; &gt; &gt; post because snow told me something she heard but I didnt...That one of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the reason why don&#x27;t do anything to my files people sometime think that it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; messing with quality I agree...but usually i don&#x27;t have to just maybe amp it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and if i find my self having to filter Ill through it out..this file in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; many opinion is perfect..
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ã&#x27;â€š 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ã&#x27;â€š 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oo also this is from a frank&#x27;s box with live communication.its also live 
&gt; &gt; &gt; real time communication...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hear no communication in this file, but traditional EVP&#x27;s are hard to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; make out especially when they are overprocessed like this one.
