<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Ann,

I&#x27;m totally on the same page about finding out the truth, whatever it 
may be. I know there are tricksters. Native Americans call them 
Coyote or Skinwalkers. 

From the clear voices and degree of two-way dialog, for me it&#x27;s 
simply about getting straight answers. I&#x27;m planning to try and be 
rigorous about testing any spirits or whatever they are before 
proceeding. The last thing I wish to do is entertain some demon or 
entity that is all about lying and half-truths.

&gt; But it must raise questions, mustn&#x27;t it, Bruce? Who are these  
&gt; entities we are talking to and why would it be such a problem for 
us  
&gt; to know who they were in life? If these are dead humans, it can&#x27;t 
see  
&gt; how it would make any difference at all. In fact, to me, being 
able  
&gt; to talk about human things with them is rather the only way to 
prove  
&gt; that they are dead humans. It does concern me that these entities 
are  
&gt; not human, not because I would particularly care if they were  
&gt; extraterrestrial or extradimentional and just admitted that, but  
&gt; because my personal desire is to talk to people like me who have  
&gt; crossed over.
&gt; 
&gt; Can you ask them to give you some sort of reason why they can&#x27;t 
tell  
&gt; you more about themselves?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, my 2 cents. I know that my line of inquiry with the box is  
&gt; going to be directed at people who have crossed. Maybe I&#x27;ll get 
some  
&gt; answers of my own shortly.

&gt; &gt; What I get from mike &amp; Lisa when I ask personal questions about  
&gt; &gt; them is a reluctant answer at best.
&gt; &gt; I have already thought to ask all of the questions you mention 
and  
&gt; &gt; more and have been answered with
&gt; &gt; &quot;NO&quot; &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; and things like &quot;Wait&quot; so I&#x27;m assuming that they 
are  
&gt; &gt; either not allowed or are not ready for me to find
&gt; &gt; out about their physical lives. I also get the impression that 
they  
&gt; &gt; want to remain as separate entities in my mind
&gt; &gt; and if I where to know who and what they where in the physical 
it  
&gt; &gt; would reduce them to a lower level of spirituality
&gt; &gt; in my mind. that is the general jist of the messages as far as 
that  
&gt; &gt; subject goes.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Rambling thoughts:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The sound quality was not as good with this batch. Lots more
&gt; &gt; background. Did you change anything?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Okay--I am completely fascinated with who these people are who 
talk
&gt; &gt; to us. I have two, both male, and god knows who they really are,
&gt; &gt; because one has changed identity at least six times over the 
years,
&gt; &gt; and one won&#x27;t tell anything at all about himself. Period. Oh, he 
says
&gt; &gt; that he won&#x27;t talk through the box either. I&#x27;m tempted to add, &quot;So
&gt; &gt; there&quot; as a direct quote. LOL. Anyway, Mike and Lisa-- So Mike 
says
&gt; &gt; he bled to death in &#x27;95; Lisa choked to death in the 1920s and 
nuts
&gt; &gt; to you for asking, apparently. ;)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Would you ask them some questions for me?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ask Mike which &#x27;95 he died in--1995 or 1895?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ask Lisa what her favorite perfume was.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ask them both more biographical questions, such as where the were
&gt; &gt; born, lived, and died. Their full names. Their spouses&#x27; names, 
kids,
&gt; &gt; etc. I&#x27;m a historian/geneologist and I think it would be a blast 
to
&gt; &gt; look in available records to try to identify them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ask them the year of their birth. If they tell you, there&#x27;s a lot 
of
&gt; &gt; historical questions I love to ask about events within their  
&gt; &gt; lifetimes.
