<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks, Lance.  I wish we&#x27;d had more time, and a better place for the
equipment.  Hopefully, there will be a followup on down the road.

&gt; Hi Rosemary,
&gt; 
&gt; We appreciate your insights and energetic efforts to put ITC in the 
&gt; spotlight where it deserves to be.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt; Last night’s C2C show with George Noory on Frank’s Box and 
&gt; similar ITC
&gt; &gt; devices went well despite the limitations of the broadcast studio in
&gt; &gt; Sherman Oaks, CA.  We were just too well shielded for the boxes to
&gt; &gt; scan properly.  I had on hand my Frank’s Ghost Box 22, Ron 
&gt; Ricketts’
&gt; &gt; very first Mini-Box to come out of production, the Radio Shack Hack,
&gt; &gt; and a Craig’s Box, a modified Daewoo car stereo done by Craig 
&gt; Telesha.
&gt; &gt;  In addition, I had a gold-beryllium alloy antenna made by Marcus 
&gt; Leader.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There’s no doubt about it, the box technologies and spirit
&gt; &gt; communication are hot topics, and will continue to be in the
&gt; &gt; spotlight, especially as more people are able to obtain a device. 
&gt; &gt; Hopefully, this will lay to rest the nonsense about a “circle 
&gt; of 30”
&gt; &gt; or any such ridiculous claims of monopoly on who can and should use
&gt; &gt; boxes.  Box technology is already democratic.  As more people obtain
&gt; &gt; and work with them, many possibilities for coordinated research and
&gt; &gt; experiments will unfold.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As an interdimensional interface, the boxes are neutral.  They are 
&gt; not
&gt; &gt; dark, demonic, negative, etc., as some fearful people worry.  
&gt; Negative
&gt; &gt; experiences are always possible, just as in any work in the
&gt; &gt; paranormal.  People who don’t know what they are doing, who are 
&gt; in it
&gt; &gt; for a lark, and who harbor fears and anxieties about the paranormal
&gt; &gt; are not well-suited to any kind of paranormal exploration, whether
&gt; &gt; it’s with a box, in automatic writing, or with a deck of Tarot 
&gt; cards.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Rick Moran, the executive director of the Association for the study 
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; Unexplained Phenomena, the sponsors of the research for the Mini-
&gt; Box,
&gt; &gt; shared some observations with me after the show that illuminate the
&gt; &gt; topic.  Here are his comments:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is a connection between every one of the designers/technicians
&gt; &gt; who have worked on the box from its inception by Spiricom. Every one
&gt; &gt; of them was a licensed Ham Radio Operator, including Frank, Ron and
&gt; &gt; Myself.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Someone asked about different antennas… because of the Ham 
&gt; connection,
&gt; &gt; that has been done already. The original Spiricom was an enormous
&gt; &gt; device and operated on the ham bands because it was the only part of
&gt; &gt; the spectrum that could offer a clear channel. They tried both
&gt; &gt; vertical and horizontal antennas. We did the same in our early
&gt; &gt; devices, both Ron and I have “antenna farms” as do many of 
&gt; the ASUP
&gt; &gt; investigators, who are also hams.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Spiricom sounded very robotic, due in part to the equipment being
&gt; &gt; used… tubes and crystals to set the frequency. This was common
&gt; &gt; practice through the 1980s.  I recently heard someone spouting a
&gt; &gt; theory that because the Spiricom used a crystal system, it was 
&gt; somehow
&gt; &gt; mystical in nature. Crystals were used in all ham radios, all 
&gt; military
&gt; &gt; radios and a lot of commercial applications… nothing mystical at 
&gt; all.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; I think Frank dropped the crystal frequency generation due to cost 
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; favor of a plain old radio tuner he pulled from an old receiver. 
&gt; Most
&gt; &gt; of his designs were admittedly adaptations of junk radios, which is
&gt; &gt; what separates his from ours. We spared no expense in designing
&gt; &gt; circuits that were critical to a clean signal.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In your discussion last night, George did not even mention the EARTH
&gt; &gt; SOUNDS project at NASA on the Ultra Low Frequency Bands. Down there
&gt; &gt; NASA has been hearing “voices” for years, which they admit, 
&gt; they can’t
&gt; &gt; explain. As you might have already guessed, that is one of our
&gt; &gt; upcoming projects. The great problem there is the length of the
&gt; &gt; antenna, to do it right an ULF antenna would be buried and would be
&gt; &gt; about 11 MILES long.  In the production model of the MiniBox, Ron 
&gt; hand
&gt; &gt; tuned the antennas, winding row upon row of fine wire to match the
&gt; &gt; necessary length of the frequencies being scanned, another 
&gt; difference
&gt; &gt; that helped to eliminate noise and upgrade the voice quality.
&gt; &gt; ____
&gt; &gt; Thanks, Rick.  And thanks to Frank, Ron, Craig, Marcus and all the
&gt; &gt; other researchers in the ITC field.
