Misty,
 
I'm not back here 5 minutes and already I am getting sarcastic no=
nsense.
I would not presume to say what you have had luck with in the past,=
 so why do you do that with me.
 
Anyway I am not worried about using water=
 or lasers or anything else. I am a box researcher.
And a damn good one. An=
d if by helping me you suggested sweeping the dial manually then yes you di=
d.
but that's all you did. I have taken box research light years beyond any=
one one that was here when I got here.
 
So please I'm asking nicely, even =
though we have had our differences in the past. 
 
Please do not try to bai=
t me into a confrontation.
I will not ablige, I just want to be here and he=
lp who ever I can.
Please just let me do that. I assure you anything I say =
is just my personal opinion.
So please let it go I do not want to be on the=
 recieving end of any negative activity.
 
thanks
Bruce
