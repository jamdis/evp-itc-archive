We know they don&#39;t \nhave vocal cords, and so they probably communicate via some kind of \nthought/mind process ...  Not to say that all the entities employ \nthis method, maybe some of the more identifiable ones like Mike and \nLisa.\n\nI love mulling over things and this will keep me mulling for quite a \nlong time.\n\nSharon the Muller\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, juli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce, you may want to also add that when they wait for those \nfragments they are in fact Mike and Lisa&#39;s voice not just any male or \nfemale voice.  They are ones that you identify as being theirs.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Juli\n&gt; \n&gt; mllejade &lt;leongbabe@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Thanks for the fast reply, Bruce! Definitely something to \nadd to my \n&gt; notes for further examination.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sharon\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday \n&gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sharon,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In my experience through research, most of the time mike will \nwait \n&gt; for a masculine fragment or signal\n&gt; &gt; and lisa will wait for a feminine one. I believe they try to \nanswer \n&gt; in the apropriate gender so that I \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t get confused about who is answering. Sometimes I will get a \n&gt; response or message that is made \n&gt; &gt; up of both male and female voices together, even in the same word \n&gt; sometimes but very rarely.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And I think when that occurs it&#39;s because they lose the \nparticular \n&gt; fragment midstream and pick up \n&gt; &gt; whatever is available at that instant to complete the message , \n&gt; word or phrase.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope this answers your question and please keep asking them. It \n&gt; forces me to formulate an answer\n&gt; &gt; and you to further your knowledge as a researcher. That&#39;s what \nit&#39;s \n&gt; all about.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: leongbabe@: Fri, 11 Jan 2008 16:26:18 \n&gt; +0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Male and female voices joined to create one \n&gt; response?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce,Is it common to receive a response comprised of a mixture \nof \n&gt; men and women sound bytes/voices (like I heard in this one)? My \nguess \n&gt; is that we hear predominantly male voices because they&#39;re more male \n&gt; radio announcers. Therefore, does the entity who announces herself \nto \n&gt; you as Lisa come through with a male voice at times (because those \n&gt; are the voices that she gets most of the time to formulate a \n&gt; response)? Please tell me if my reasoning here is way off \n&gt; base...Thanks,Sharon--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-\n&gt; ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Hello,&gt; &gt; This email message is a \n&gt; notification to let you know that&gt; a file has been uploaded to the \n&gt; Files area of the EVP-ITC &gt; group.&gt; &gt; File : /*Bruce RS files_1-2-\n&gt; 08/7B_WE DON&#39;T HAVE THE RIGHT SIGNAL FOR CONTROLING THAT.wav &gt; \n&gt; Uploaded by : bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; &gt; Description : \n&gt; 7B_WE DON&#39;T HAVE THE RIGHT SIGNAL FOR CONTROLING THAT.wav &gt; &gt; You \ncan \n&gt; access this file at the URL:&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-\n&gt; ITC/files/%2ABruce%20RS%20files_1-2-08/7B_WE%20DON%27T%20HAVE%20THE%\n&gt; 20RIGHT%20SIGNAL%20FOR%20CONTROLING%20THAT.wav &gt; &gt; To learn more \n&gt; about file sharing for your group, please visit:&gt; \n&gt; \nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htm\n&gt; lfiles&gt; &gt; Regards,&gt; &gt; bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get the power of Windows + Web with the new Windows Live.\n&gt; &gt; http://www.windowslive.com?\n&gt; ocid=TXT_TAGHM_Wave2_powerofwindows_012008\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                          \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private & \nconfidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is \naddressed to.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;   No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or \nforwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.\n&gt;"}
