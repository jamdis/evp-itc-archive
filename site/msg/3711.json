I understand the =\r\npracticality of them (ie- creating random white noise to allow EVPs to be f=\r\normed) but I hope to gain an understanding of how they work technically in =\r\nhopes of building and tweaking my own.For me EVP has been something I&#39;ve be=\r\nen into all my life without knowing what it was (I&#39;m 30 now, I first learne=\r\nd the technical term about 22 or 23) - I guess I&#39;m what people would call &#39;=\r\nsensitive&#39; or whatever. But besides that, early on I was fascinated by seem=\r\ningly coherant sounds that would come out of random noise on my clock radio=\r\n in my bedroom as a kid, from what sounded like voices (thought I was crazy=\r\n for a while) to even morse code - for a long time one of my radios would p=\r\nroduce random clicks or pops even when the speaker was off. My dad jokingly=\r\n suggested it was morse code, so I studied morse code and discovered that a=\r\nt least some of it could be morse letters...usually they would spell one wo=\r\nrd and then gibberish.Anyways, once I learned what EVP was I began messing =\r\naround with recorders etc. My first clear recording came from using EVP mak=\r\ner and was someone saying &#39;we have been waiting for you.&#39; A few days later,=\r\n after a frustrating lack of communication they just told me &#39;build a box.(=\r\nthis happened to be after I learned of frank.)&#39; I&#39;ve been looking at all th=\r\ne boxes and their positives and negatives and this is what I&#39;m seeing:Frank=\r\ns models seem to produce the most consistant results but also seem to be le=\r\nss two way than some others (ie Joe&#39;s Box.) Joe&#39;s Box and the new radio sha=\r\nck mod seem to have some very clear voices coming through but skeptics can =\r\nargue that all you are hearing is snippets from radio broadcasts.My thought=\r\n for a cost-effective, low-tech alternative is to combine the two in that y=\r\nou create a radio shack mod like the UFOGeek one (multiple radios, a mixer,=\r\n etc) and run it through an echo box.Personally I believe that analog is gi=\r\nving the best results overall, and I think it has to do with ease of manipu=\r\nlating the signal. Therefore my thought is taking a digital white noise sig=\r\nnal like that produced by the radio shack mods and then essentially broadca=\r\nsting it into the echo chamber and having a mic pick it up gives you the an=\r\nalog aspect.My question is has anyone tried this? And I was hoping for thou=\r\nghts on the pros and cons of using AM vs. FM or both.Oh, one other thing- a=\r\nny programmers/engineers out there? Someone that could write code to allow =\r\nus to randomly band scan a digital radio? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ___________________=\r\n_______________________________________&gt; Share life as it happens with the =\r\nnew Windows Live.Download today it&#39;s FREE!&gt; http://www.windowslive.com/shar=\r\ne.html?ocid=3DTXT_TAGLM_Wave2_sharelife_112007&gt;\n\nYou keep typing, we keep g=\r\niving.

Therefore my =\r\nthought is taking a digital white noise signal &lt;BR&gt;like that produced by th=\r\ne radio shack mods and then essentially &lt;BR&gt;broadcasting it into the echo c=\r\nhamber and having a mic pick it up &lt;BR&gt;gives you the analog aspect.My quest=\r\nion is has anyone tried this? And &lt;BR&gt;I was hoping for thoughts on the pros=\r\n and cons of using AM vs. FM or &lt;BR&gt;both.Oh, one other thing- any programme=\r\nrs/&lt;WBR&gt;engineers out there? &lt;BR&gt;Someone that could write code to allow us =\r\nto randomly band scan a &lt;BR&gt;digital radio? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ____________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR=\r\n&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Share life as it happe=\r\nns with the new Windows Live.Download today &lt;BR&gt;it&#39;s FREE!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.windowslive.com/share.html?&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.wind=\r\nowsl&lt;WBR&gt;ive.com/share.&lt;WBR&gt;html?&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;ocid=3DTXT_TAGLM_&lt;WBR&gt;Wave2_sharel=\r\nife_&lt;WBR&gt;112007&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPA=\r\nN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;HR&gt;\nYou keep typing, we keep giving.
