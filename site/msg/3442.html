<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello Bruce,

Forgive me for bluntness, but typing in all capital letters is 
considered to be shouting by some of us. It&#x27;s also hard to follow. 

Absolutely no offense intended... I just thought you should know.

Thanks,
Lance

&gt;  HI GUY&#x27;S JUST A SHORT EXPLANATION OF WHAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
GATHER.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ANYONE THAT IS A SERIOUS EVP RESEARCHER HAS PROBABLY READ THE 
ARTICLES 
&gt; AND OR BOOKS PERTAINING TO THE EALY TIME STREAM EXPERIMENTS AND 
WHAT 
&gt; WAS CALLED THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT. IT INVOLVED SUCH RESEARCHERS AS 
MAGGY 
&gt; HERSHBACH AND HER HUSBAND THAT WHERE THE RECIPIENTS OF LONG LENGTHY 
&gt; MESSAGES IN ALL DIFFERENT FORMATS FROM THE SPIRIT WORLD THEY IN 
TURN 
&gt; WORKED WITH SUCH EVP PIONEERS AS HANS MUELLER, KONSTANTINE 
&gt; RAUDIVA,GEORGE MEEK AND MARK MACY TO NAME A FEW. THESE EARLY 
PIONEERS 
&gt; THROUGH THE HERSHBACHS IN LUXEMBORG RECIEVED DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS 
ON 
&gt; HOW TO FURTHER COMMUNICATION THAT NOT ONLY LED TO OUR CURRENT EVP 
&gt; GATHERING TECHNIQUES BUT ALSO THE MOTHER OF ALL BOXES THE SPIRICOM.
&gt; THESE RESEARCHERS WERE TOLD THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIANT IN THE 
&gt; STRENGTH AND FURTHERENCE OF SPIRIT COMMUNICATION WAS HARMONY AND 
PEACE 
&gt; AND GOOD INTENTIONS WITHIN THIS CIRCLE THEY HAD BEEN LED TO FORM.
&gt; 
&gt; BUT SADLY AS HUMAN BEINGS USUALLY DO JELOUSY AND EGO BECAME A 
POISON TO 
&gt; THE CIRCLE AND SOME INDIVIDUALS THAT WHERE ENVIOUS OF OTHERS 
SUPERIOR 
&gt; SUCESSES BROUGHT BAD VIBRATIONSS TO THE GROUP AND THE CIRCLE WAS 
BROKEN.
&gt; 
&gt; IMMEDIATLY FOLLOWING THE ADVANCED COMMUNICATION THAT HAD BEEN 
ENJOYED 
&gt; FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SLOWLY DWINDLED AWAY.
&gt; 
&gt; NOW I BELIEVE WE ARE BEING GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS 
&gt; UNPRESIDENTED TASK AND BRIDGE THE GAP OF COMMUNICATION FULLY.
&gt; AS OF LATE THERE HAS BEEN A FLOOD OF NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT SEEMS TO 
BE 
&gt; WORKING AS HOPED WE ARE IN OUR FETAL STAGES BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD WE 
&gt; WILL BE BROUGHT ALONG SLOWELY AND CAREFULLY.
&gt; 
&gt; SO MY THOUGHTS ARE LETS KEEP THE GOOD VIBES AND HARMONY GOING AND 
BLOCK 
&gt; AS MUCH OF THE NEGATIVITY AS WE CAN AND ALL WORK TOGETHER TWORD 
THIS 
&gt; COMMON GOAL. LETS NOT LET THE SINS OF OUR FATHER SO TO SPEAK AFFECT 
&gt; WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH.
&gt; 
&gt; BRUCE HALLIDAY
