<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It probably would help, but may just take some patience, and 
practice. This stuff can be done on the extreme cheap. Several here 
have had good sussess with just using an AM or FM radio, tuning it 
slowly by hand while recording wiht the intention of getting EVP. I 
always announce I&#x27;m doing an EVP recording, then tell thenm when I&#x27;m 
stopping. it&#x27;s kind of the Mini Box in manula mode. You can record 
eiterh from the speaker, or a hearphone/line ouput jack. 
there&#x27;s alos EVPmaker, and well as a number of other simple EVP 
method, such as using running water as background sound.

&gt; Hello All!
&gt; I just recently discovered this group through the Ufogeek&#x27;s website.
&gt; I have been experiencing shadows, electrical sensations that feel 
like
&gt; someone else is with me. With that being said, I ask if this
&gt; technology you all talk about on this group would help me speak with
&gt; those presences I feel with me? I do not claim a label such as 
medium,
&gt; psychic or any other title as I think labels are limiting. I am just
&gt; sensitive.
&gt; It is a sense that has run in my family for generations and 
somewhere
&gt; along the line we started calling it radar.
&gt; I have had experienced a situation with a very close friend that a
&gt; shadow literally popped in on us at the exact time her father passed
&gt; away. She was unable to see it and I was. It literally scared the 
@#$
&gt; out of me. I have been trying to figure out why he came to us and 
why
&gt; I was the only one to see this. I was hoping this technology would
&gt; help me understand the presences that come to me. I have no 
intentions
&gt; of using this for monetary gain or for other people, I just want to
&gt; understand the presences that come to me. Seems the older I get the
&gt; more prevalent they are.
&gt; Let me know your thoughts.
