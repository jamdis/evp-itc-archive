<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Nick,

Just so you know that all this is just personal opinions and i don&#x27;t 
believe that Bruce stressed that to you in the post.  Every 
researcher has their own opinions on how it is done and the results 
have varied amongst us.  There is no way to actually explain to 
someone how these devices work, i couldn&#x27;t tell you that leaving the 
box on will make it imprint because there are no facts based on this 
research thus far.  Only personal opinions have been put out there 
and what we have experienced for ourselves up to this point.  
Everybody needs to do their own research with a little helping hand 
from those who have been doing this a little while longer and that&#x27;s 
it.  You will find your own niche in this communication and teach 
what you&#x27;ve learned to others one day.  Just remember that nobody can 
tell how it should be, because there is no proof only some personal 
experiences.  That covers all paranormal areas, you can believe or 
not in something but you can&#x27;t prove it to others or at least i don&#x27;t 
think anybody has yet??

-Steve .

&gt; Nick,
&gt;  
&gt; You are a new member and a possible researcher so I do not want to 
get off on the wrong foot
&gt; It sounds like you may have taken what I said as criticism, It was 
not meant to be.
&gt; Just experienced advice. There are some researchers that believe it 
is beneficial to leave 
&gt; a box running and unattended, so that our spirit friends 
can &quot;imprint&quot; to the frequency of the box
&gt;  
&gt; That is not at all necessary, Spirit techs do need to imprint to 
certain boxes but do so through two way communication
&gt; you see they also imprint the energy signature of the user of the 
box also. And that can only be accomplished through 
&gt; communicative interaction during a session. If the box is left 
unattended they may only accomplish half of what they need to do.
&gt;  
&gt; Also I have had first hand experience with certain researchers that 
do practice this lackadaisical us of a box and had begun to 
&gt; get less and less communication during attempts at actual sessions 
and eventually nothing but negative entities coming through.
&gt; I am not saying this is solely due to doing an absent session which 
is what I have come to call it, It entails man6y factors.
&gt;  
&gt; But the absent session practice definitely contributes to the 
ultimate failure of communication. 
&gt; Nick, it is better for you to establish solid research practices in 
the beginning that will serve to enhance your communication 
&gt; skills and growth in the future.
&gt;  
&gt; Remember your spirit contacts or &quot;technicians&quot; will become not only 
the facilitators of your link and communication from the
&gt; other side but they will become your trusted friends and 
protectors. you would never leave your buddy on the phone and go 
&gt; on to something else while he remained on the line calling for you 
to speak with him. Our spirit friends where people just like us
&gt; at one time and the emotions we carry in the physical also carry 
over to our spirit lives.
&gt;  
&gt; I hope you do not take this as preaching or criticism it is just 
experience from communicating with my own techs and friends
&gt; and gathering information on what they feel and expect from us as 
researchers.
&gt; Remember all we have to do is turn on a box and listen and record 
their job to send the communication 
&gt; no matter how short the phrase or word is a 1000x harder for them 
so don&#x27;t you think they deserve a 100% 
&gt; of our attention when we open the lines of communication.
&gt;  
&gt; Also in closing let me say that my belief on &quot;imprinting&quot; of a box 
is for boxes like Frank&#x27;s box and the mini box, for the simple
&gt; reason that they are individually made and each carry a slightly 
different frequency range, indicative to that particular box.
&gt; The radio shack hack box on the other hand is manufactured in china 
most likely on an automated assembly line so each
&gt; circuit board is exactly like the next, this being the case I 
believe that when our friends imprinted on the first of the RS boxes
&gt; it was sufficient for most of the others. That is why people 
experience immediate communication right out of the box.
&gt;  
&gt; So therefore the RS box does not need that grace period to &quot;Imprint&quot;
&gt;  
&gt; These comments and statements are my own hypothesis based on my own 
extensive research with every type of box that is made to date
&gt; and I am only offering it so that it may help others to avoid the 
toil and mistakes that I have endured.
&gt;  
&gt; thanks for giving me the soap box once again!
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Just FYI, I had stopped checking my email at that time and was 
trying to get someone to say something.  I usually can&#x27;t get my self 
to not pay attention to the box when i turn it on.

&gt; Nick, My advice as a long time researcher is not to just turn the 
box on and leave it running unless you intend to do a session and 
give your friends on the other side that are workingextremely hard to 
send you the communication your undivided attention. It&#x27;s kind of 
like calling someone on the phone and when they start a conversation 
you decide toput the phone down and focus your attention on other 
things. There are other researchers that feel that there is nothing 
wrong with this practice and do it on occasionBut I have come to the 
understanding that it is deemed disrespectful and while you may be 
listening with one ear as you do something else, you will hear a loud 
curse word or nasty statement, that is their way of getting your 
attention back. I have gotten numerous messages about the difficulty 
of the attempts for them to communicate so when I turn the box on it 
gets my full attention. just some experienced advice. As for them 
telling you to close the portal, it could have two meanings. 
Sometimes they refer to box thatis turned on and in use as a portal 
for the simple reason that each time we turn a box on to communicate 
it opens a direct open link between our realm and theirs so in 
essence it is an open door for anything to pass in or out. that is 
why when I end a session I always ask my technician to bring back any 
spirits that may have come through the portal during the session and 
I ask for conformation and 10 times out of ten will get &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;OK 
THEY ARE BACK&quot; also they may have meant since you had the box running 
and where not doing a actual session to shut the box so that they 
could go and not have to protect the open connection from any 
negative entities that where able cross through the openportal. A few 
researchers have been receiving numerous messages about the number 7 
within the past month. The only known significance that the number 7 
has in evp research is the 7 entities that controlled communication 
back in the eighties and ninetiesduring the spiricom and luxembourg 
era. To receive this number in messages so often and by more than one 
researcher, odiouslyholds some importance which they have not been 
able or are not ready to convey. If you need any help or have any 
questions please feel free to ask. Bruce

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hey,Anyone have any odd problems in the morning with using it. I am 
sitting here checking my email so i just thought i&#x27;d turn it on 
and... not check my email. Anywho.... Then right at about 6:20 i 
heard a voice say &quot;Nicholas Etheridge please turn off the dsfnlsd&quot; 
not quite sure what word it used... possibly portal. I just thought 
it was weird. Also under all of the jumble and this voice speaking i 
heard a deep male voice almost chanting &quot;seven&quot;. Not sure if I 
actually heard this or its the want to have an excuse to stay home 
and not take the HSAs.Anyway.. just curious if anyone has gotten 
heard this or if they know something I don&#x27;t about using the box in 
the morning.Peace,Nick
