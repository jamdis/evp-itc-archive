Bill, I've been considering using a desktop or laptop computer, an Icom PCR=
-1000 w/o an antenna  (all mode 1khz-1300Mhz freq scanning), a program call=
ed RecAll for recording, & if needed a tnc program called AGWPE to tie it a=
ll together?  I'm still learning and not sure how to fine tune or set it al=
l up to work?  It sounds really cool & is definitely taking shortwave liste=
ning to next level!

Ken

Hello everyone - Bill here. Been fascinated with =
EVPs on C2C for 
years and a few days ago realized that I have a room full =
of high end 
audio and video recording equipment, 4 computers and software =
to do 
anything with anything...Hey! I can set something up to do EVPs! 
I'=
ve got a starter set on my desktop that worked on the first try 
and "Rick"=
 (my contact)has been helpful in getting it fine tuned. 
Desktop setup uses=
 EVPmaker chewing up a 1 minute segment of a man 
giving a talk, with white=
 noise (EVP said "use that noise")in a loop 
on Soundbooth. I use a AKG 414=
 mike about 18" from the computer 
speakers and simply lean over it to ask =
questions, and record on to 
Audition. 
My next move is to create a laptop =
based system using as few 
components as possible. I'm looking at the Radio=
Shark 2 USB am/fm 
radio, and hoping to leave it "stock" and have it scan u=
sing 
software. I've found some 3rd party software that might work, but 
do=
n't know the particulars of the "scan" function. Anybody here gone 
this ro=
ute or know of software that will work? My portable sytem 
would be the lap=
top, Radio Shark 2, and a microphone-and maybe a 
Logitec external speaker.=
 Play white noise and radio scan thru 
speakers, record back on computer. W=
haddya think?
Started my listening career in teh 1960's building Knight kit=
 
shortwave radios, and still enjoy Shortwave listening - utilites 
mostly.=
 EVP seems like the next level.
Thanks
Bill__._,_.__
