I will try and post more from it later when I get time. There \nwas one very lengthy message that seemed to be a higher level &#39;poetic&#39; \ntype voice. Also some messages involving a new member to our group. \nIt&#39;s up to him if he wants to share his experiences. However I did post \nthe one file with his name because it has some significant meaning to \nme that I explained on the file post there. It reminded me of something \nFrank Sumption sent me years ago when I was a newbie and had the same \neffect on me that it had on the new member.\n\nhttp://www.esnips.com/web/SweepTuningEVP\n\nMisty Dawn"}
