Oh brother...are you kidding us, Snow?

For what it's worth, the file=

=C2=A0
Why can't some=C2=A0people hear these things? I=C2=A0understand no=
w=C2=A0why Frank gets so frustrated at times, especially when people tell=
=C2=A0him (or Steve or anyone, really!) what their files "really" say. 
=C2=
=A0
Further, I don't think people here share their=C2=A0files so that other=
s can (mis)=C2=A0"interpret" their recordings=C2=A0for them!

I've s=

Thank you for correcting me, ho=
pefully one day i will have a better ear to hear the communication like you=
 do. 

Maybe Frank and I should give up. He has about 8 years listening to =
box communication and i have about 5, but the newer people are empatically =
telling us what our files really say.

Maybe Frank and I are losing our ear=
 for this.
