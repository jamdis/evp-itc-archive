I post things all the time without expectation that anyone else can hear it or that anyone else will comment on it. If you need feedback grab a few friends, record together, share every file and comment in chat if they do or dont hear it.

Why dont you start one up.

You could run it seven days a week if you get enough volunteers =)\n   \n  Rest is up to you guys.
