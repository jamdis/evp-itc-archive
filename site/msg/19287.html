&gt; *Hi Frank, do you think the electronics people knew about the voices?
&gt; Could that be the reason they made the radios to scan in silence...I wonder?

&gt;    Many, maybe most of these &quot;digital&quot; radios are actually analog tuners
&gt; that are voltage tuned. So instead of removing the tuner, as these are large
&gt; boards, just add a sweep board. It&#x27;s the same thing Hultay does. It has the
&gt; advange of much better sound, since you&#x27;re using he amplifiers and speakers
&gt; that it was designed with. This also has the built in tape deck.
&gt;
&gt;  The radio is kind of a crap shoot, as some are all digital, and the tuner
&gt; is tuned with software, usually IC-to-IC(ICsquared) a language put out by
&gt; Philips. Some car tuners use this, and I even had a couple Arm Band radio
&gt; that are all digital tuning.

&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s wild, Frank!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I admit to having a very limited scope and knowledge of electronics in
&gt;&gt; general and how these things are built and actually function specifically,
&gt;&gt; but still, opening them up and showing us &quot;the works&quot; like this just boggles
&gt;&gt; my mind.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks for doing what ya do, lol!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Converting an AM/FM/Cassette/CD player is great. I like it, I like it.

&gt;&gt;   AM/FM/Cassette/CD boom box. With an added board for linear, random and
&gt;&gt; manual sweep, built 9/2008. It was sweeping out of band on FM, so I added a
&gt;&gt; control to set the sweep limits on the back panel, and a linear rate control
&gt;&gt; on the side.
