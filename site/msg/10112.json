I took 5 files \nand played them in a sequence and recorded it, it consists of tone \nfrequencies ranging from 100hz, 250hz, 440hz, 1khz and 10khz.  They \nwere 5 second clips of each and than i ran it through EvpMaker and it \nsounds like morse code, but i have to brush up on it to see if it makes \nany sense.  Is it possible for them to communicate through morse code?  \nI&#39;ve attached a 30 second clip of the example running it through \nEvpMaker.  I&#39;ll also attach my original tone file i created.\n \n-Steve H."}
