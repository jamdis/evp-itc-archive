&gt;  2 different things happening-that&#x27;s why. When you get EVP that everyone
&gt; understands, it is outward, in the environment. Not a communication through
&gt; subconscious means.
&gt;
&gt; EVP that people swear they hear, but noone else can make sense, may be a
&gt; message to them via subconscious means. That isn&#x27;t to say that ALL EVP&#x27;s
&gt; like this are true messages, I am sure alot are just matrixing.
&gt;
&gt; But then that is how the art of scrying starts-matrixing. Like the
&gt; Rorschach tests. The images you matrix with those gives the psychologist an
&gt; insight into your mind.
&gt;
&gt; By gazing into a dark, reflective surface, you start to see cloudy images.
&gt; At first, you will just be matrixing faces in the clouds and not getting
&gt; much substance. Try it, you will see what I am saying. With practice, you
&gt; start to see clear, concise images.
&gt;
&gt; I think that is what happening with audio as well.
&gt;
&gt; We already know for a fact pareidolia can occur in audio as well as visual
&gt; stimulus.

&gt;  yes I understand its personal to that particular individual but why can&#x27;t
&gt; I hear it.  I have gotten some very personal EVPs through the traditional
&gt; investigation way (not through a box or anything of that matter) that all
&gt; others have heard.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know for sure about that one either, but I am not ready to
&gt;&gt; discount it either, especially since I stumbled across the possibility of
&gt;&gt; audible scrying. But I am sure alot of people don&#x27;t believe in scrying at
&gt;&gt; all either.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What makes it a possibility to me is that so many people are hearing
&gt;&gt; things that are very personal, but stuff they would not have come up with on
&gt;&gt; their own.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I think that is the problem I am having though Jim.  When you say &quot;work
&gt;&gt; them over till you hear them&quot;  to me I should not have to work them over
&gt;&gt; till I hear them.  Yes taking out the ambient and background noise is one
&gt;&gt; thing.  But if you just keep on listening to them with different
&gt;&gt; enhancements you are bound to hear something (matrixing).  If one person is
&gt;&gt; not meant to hear it they won&#x27;t hear it (I guess I am not quite ready to
&gt;&gt; believe that one right yet).  I think you all know what I am getting at.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, for myself...I don&#x27;t &quot;clean&quot; them up to much because I really don&#x27;t
&gt;&gt;&gt; know HOW :) (well a little bit)Since I&#x27;ve only been at it for a couple
&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks. BUT if you can clean up something to where you can FIND what was
&gt;&gt;&gt; there to begin with &quot;you have done no harm&quot; I hear alot more than others I
&gt;&gt;&gt; guess, and I haven&#x27;t enhanced many of my evp&#x27;s.*If anyone is able to clean
&gt;&gt;&gt; them up...I DO promise you will hear what I say is correct)Pretty BOLD
&gt;&gt;&gt; statement, but if you are able to clean it up with better software (please
&gt;&gt;&gt; do for others too) I will be more than happy to &quot;listen&quot; where I made a
&gt;&gt;&gt; mistake...I can only LEARN from it :) I have done some DEEP enhancements to
&gt;&gt;&gt; a few of my evp&#x27;s...from the begining I could only hear clicks and
&gt;&gt;&gt; thumps.....but after messing with that area, eventually I would hear the
&gt;&gt;&gt; true voices (and can tell if male or female...approximate age) and
&gt;&gt;&gt; understand the mood also....these where extreamly modified, and I feel that
&gt;&gt;&gt; I could NOT have added enough &quot;simple&quot; enhancements that would ADD a
&gt;&gt;&gt; voice....full of emotion and distinct syllables :) And some just can&#x27;t hear
&gt;&gt;&gt; them for what ever reason be it equipment that is used to hear
&gt;&gt;&gt; (pc-headphones-speakers-ears) know one has the perfect match of all these
&gt;&gt;&gt; things. Check out &quot;Jim&#x27;s RR-DR60 EVP&#x27;s&quot; in the files section....work them
&gt;&gt;&gt; over till you hear them. I really can&#x27;t do much more :)--- In

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Now I may be biased to the &quot;investigation&quot; way of doing things. I do

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; up evps if I hear something and can&#x27;t make it out do to ambient noise.
&gt;&gt;&gt; So
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; hear is my question. When do you stop cleaning up? Wouldn&#x27;t to much
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; enhancing &quot;taint&quot; the results? To me the more enhancing you do the less
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; convincing it becomes. I hope noone finds this offensive, it is not
&gt;&gt;&gt; meant
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to be I am just really curious. The way I look at it is that if you
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; do so much enhancing to find anything, was there really something there
&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; begin with. Are we just making ourselves believe there is something
&gt;&gt;&gt; there??
