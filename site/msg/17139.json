Truck run over your Zone VI view camera? He&#39;d replace it, no\nquestions asked.\n\nI think Calumet Photo still honors the lifetime warranties of the Zone VI\nstuff. Hopefully they don&#39;t lose too much money on it. I know offering any\nsort of support for a product gets expensive.\n\nZack\n\nOn Wed, May 12, 2010 at 12:23 PM, Urkel23 &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; After listening to my friend Rich&#39;s suggestion, i decided to make available\n&gt; some of my\n&gt; boxes for sale on my site.
