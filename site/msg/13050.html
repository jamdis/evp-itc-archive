Below is some informatio=

A new documentary coming in early 2009
"Voices From The =

those who perished in a commercial jetliner crash which claimed all on-boar=
d.
The 4g+ crash impact being so violent, all passengers and crew died inst=
antly.=A0 They had only a matter of seconds prior to their terrifying verti=
cal plunge. Witnesses described the aftermath scene as more gruesome than t=
hey had ever experienced.
Some say spirit communication is more likely to o=
ccur if a person had suffered a quick, tragic death, with minimal time to p=
repare but enough time for emotional thought and feelings to run high, such=
 as what happened in this tragic accident.
The incident took only seconds, =
but according to the official report there was enough time for very high em=

With this theory in min=
d,=A0 Mike will perform ITC sessions at the scene of the crash (exact impac=

ions.
During ITC sessions a number of paranormal devices will be used, some=
 designed by Mike and currently in the prototype stage. 
Mike will begin fi=

this Paradoc on his Youtube website (Youtube.com/ ufogeek), early in 2009. =
