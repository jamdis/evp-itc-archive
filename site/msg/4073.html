<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve been interested for many years in a lot of the stuff that takes 
place outside the ham bands.  Spy numbers stations, long delayed 
echoes, utilitiy transmissions, oddidites, pirate shortwave radio, 
over-the-horizon-radar and many other things.  A lot of ham operators 
don&#x27;t seem to be too interested in these things.

I have thought sometimes that I was a &quot;sensitive&quot; but it&#x27;s not something I 
can control and it comes and goes with no apparent pattern.

&gt; Greetings Ken,

&gt; I am also a fellow &quot;licensed Ham Radio Operator&quot; and have been told
&gt; by others that I am a &quot;Sensitive&quot;, which would explain much that has
&gt; happened in my life.
&gt; On the subject of licensed operators, I&#x27;m guessing there may be many
&gt; of us &quot;Hams&quot; who enjoy searching and exploring the world of heard &amp;
&gt; unheard frequencies. It is one that is wide open at the moment. That
&gt; is why we enjoy finding and experimenting with new techniques,
&gt; devices, and ideas. We number many more than thirty, and there&#x27;s room
&gt; for plenty more... Welcome to the group!

&gt;&gt; Greetings All,  My name is Ken &amp; I&#x27;ve been reading the group for a
&gt; few days now.
&gt;&gt; I have some observations &amp; a couple of ideas I&#x27;d like to share:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It amazes me how like minded intentions attract the same.
&gt;&gt; Like Rick Moran, Frank, &amp; Ron.  I too am a licensed Ham Radio
&gt; Operator and
&gt;&gt; am very interested in EVP,etc.  I&#x27;m also a Remote Viewer,
&gt; Sensitive, &amp; dowser.
&gt;&gt; My studies have taught me that these things basically work on the
&gt; same principles.
&gt;&gt; In Physics there&#x27;s something called Quantum entanglement.  In a
&gt; nutshell, Its the
&gt;&gt; idea of all things being familiar &amp; related due to their physical
&gt; make up.  Like identical
&gt;&gt; twins separated at birth, all things are connected and aware of one
&gt; another, even though
&gt;&gt; miles apart &amp; separated for years.  Also, just as time &amp; space
&gt; exists in a vacuum, all
&gt;&gt; things live forever.  Once a word is spoken or an attitude is acted
&gt; out its effects can be
&gt;&gt; witnessed forever, (Like dropping a pebble in water &amp; watching the
&gt; ripples).  When I was
&gt;&gt; teen I overdosed on some chemically treated weed.  I had an OBE &amp;
&gt; saw the tunnel of
&gt;&gt; white light thing, had the whole experience.  Ever since then I&#x27;ve
&gt; understood that we are
&gt;&gt; multidimensional, nothing dies, it only evolves or changes energy
&gt; forms.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; People will always shy away from &amp; fear that which they don&#x27;t
&gt; understand.
&gt;&gt; They try to label things as evil, good, right, &amp; wrong.  Things are
&gt; relative.
&gt;&gt; Your intentions are what makes things what they are.  You will
&gt; always find
&gt;&gt; what you look for.  Keep up the good work, its all very interesting.
&gt;&gt;
