You just have to add a couple DC blocking\n&gt; caps to convert a radio to varactors.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I ordered a capacitance meter from China for 20 bucks that should help\n&gt; solve the problem. No wonder the US is going bankrupt, ya can&#39;t find\n&gt; anything comparable here, well I could find it, but twice the price. I hate\n&gt; to not buy US, but with electronics there&#39;s not much choice.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;\nsony was japanese made but now made in china"}
