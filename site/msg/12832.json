Sure sounds like there could be a few words in there...others \n&gt; in the group with more editing experience might help you pick \n&gt; something out. ron\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Sat, 11/15/08, M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Diode EVP Capture Device I built\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Saturday, November 15, 2008, 8:28 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well, I did some testing of the device this evening... and wow! \nIt \n&gt; &gt; worked better than I thought it would.\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not a microphone but it picks up energy in the area and \n&gt; produces \n&gt; &gt; waveforms.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve produced a short video showing a demonstration of what it \n&gt; &gt; captured in two modes.
