<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have heard it and was not impressed, neither as a Spiritualist or a  
historian. And I want Houdini to talk from beyond--I really, deeply  
do. But this wasn&#x27;t it. HMO and your milage may vary and all, and  
obviously does. But please believe me that I approached that material  
months ago with the greatest hope that it would be genuine. I saw  
nothing in it that convinced me.

&gt;&gt; I highly doubt there is a afterlife rivalry between the two of  
&gt;&gt; them. Where would the rivalry or competition come from? As for  
&gt;&gt; Chris, well he has a gift for being dramatic to a fault. I have in  
&gt;&gt; the past heard Edison wants to be left alone and doesn&#x27;t want to  
&gt;&gt; mess with scientific subjects anymore. He is content in his  
&gt;&gt; present work (whatever that may be).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Houdini and his enemies have sense &quot;buried the hatchet&quot; and they  
&gt;&gt; were willing to kill each other over their lifetime rivalry. Harry  
&gt;&gt; has since said they are cordial.

&gt;&gt; Oh dear. I keep hope that this supposed rivalry between dead  
&gt;&gt; Edison and dead Tesla is just a cosmic joke being pulled on Chris  
&gt;&gt; Moon...
