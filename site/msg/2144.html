<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve often wondered abut this.  It seems others have often gotten EVP 
where I didn&#x27;t, at the same time and place.

I got a LOT of them at the former Manteno State Mental Hospital (Illinois) 
last year though.  I got the same ones on both a pocket DVR and a 
camcorder. Most were Class B EVP because they were barely perceptible. 
Being a radio amateur who has spent hundreds of hours digging weak voices 
out of the noise helps to hear them, though. I did get a few Class A&#x27;s.

Some of the things I heard were like these.  When I write &quot;questioner&quot; I 
mean someone in the group who asked the question.  When I write &quot;EVP&quot; I 
mean the response, which was not from anyone in the group.

Questioner: &quot;Are there other spirits here with you?&quot; / EVP: &quot;You bet&quot; 
(male voice, slightly speeded up)

Questioner: &quot;Are you happy?&quot; / EVP: &quot;Course I&#x27;m haaaapeeee&quot; (long 
drawn-out male voice, almost slowed down)

Questioner: Do you know what year it is?&quot; / EVP: &quot;1996&quot; (female voice, 
normal speed, very dim. The year was in fact 2006).

Questioner: &quot;Do you like it here?&quot; / EVP: &quot;Leave this building!&quot; (normal 
male voice but quite dim and almost in noise)

Two group members chatting, suddenly a very speeded up word thrown in / 
EVP: &quot;Fantastic&quot;. (I slowed it to half-speed with Audacity, then it 
sounded like a normal male voice with a slight accent - Italian?)

Group member commenting on shadow figure seen in adjacent part of building 
through window: &quot;... I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a person, at least living.&quot; / EVP: 
&quot;It&#x27;s Harold Wing&quot;.  Group member &quot;I can still see it moving&quot; / EVP: &quot;It&#x27;s 
Harold Wing&quot;.  Group member makes another comment / EVP &quot;It&#x27;s Harold.&quot; 
(This was a Class A EVP, sounding like a very loud whisper or hoarse male 
voice).

The Manteno State Mental Hospital was closed in 1985.  There&#x27;s a lot of 
info here: http://www.mantenostatehospital.com

The building we were in was the last remaining building of the original 
hospital still standing that hasn&#x27;t been renovated or destroyed - the 
Morgan Building.  A researcher found out that there was a patient there in 
1936 named Arnold Wing who died of malaria or typhoid.

Verrry interesting stuff!

&gt; One of the reasons I believe the researcher is often part of the
&gt; process is because some investigators seem to be able to consistently
&gt; obtain evp&#x27;s while others are not, despite many attempts over years of
&gt; investigating. Sometimes the teams in CA refer to those who often get
&gt; decent results as &quot;evp magnets&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; I think the individuals who can easily obtain good results (no matter
&gt; where they are) may be able to channel their psychic abilities into PK
&gt; energy and record the results as an evp. I&#x27;m not suggesting this is
&gt; what happens every time but it may be what&#x27;s happening in some of the
&gt; cases.

&gt;&gt; Hi Tracy,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you study human agent poltergeist cases of psychokinesis, the
&gt;&gt; identified human agent is always in the house of structure when the
&gt;&gt; objects move.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The famous Miami Hotel case that Dr. William Roll investigated is a
&gt;&gt; great example. When a certain kitchen worker was present, all sorts
&gt;&gt; of objects were thrown around the room. When he was not there,
&gt;&gt; nothing happened. When he left the Hotel for good, no more activity
&gt;&gt; was ever recorded.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would like to try to rule out, or, support the theory that we are
&gt;&gt; not, or that we might be imprinting EVP&#x27;s on audio tracks or tape.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My own personal experience in EVP gathering leads me to believe that
&gt;&gt; this is phenomena driven, not my subconscious mind.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But now I have to try and find out the truth for myself.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This last year we saw an incredible amount of EVP&#x27;s being recorded
&gt;&gt; during our cases we investigated.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The above is our link to our new EVP gallery if you would like to
&gt;&gt; listen to them. These were all recorded in the last year using
&gt;&gt; multiple recorders in each location. There is a Grade A and a Grade
&gt;&gt; B icon to seperate them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I am not sure this would still rule it out.  I don&#x27;t think
&gt;&gt; psychokinesis is restrained by walls, the mind isn&#x27;t restrained by
&gt;&gt; walls whether human or deceased.  I am guessing that psychokinesis
&gt;&gt; behaves similar to telepathy....
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;   I believe many evp&#x27;s are deceased spirits, but the question on
&gt;&gt; whether it could be a living person imprinting the evps was
&gt;&gt; certainly one that made me really think !

&gt;&gt;&gt;               Hi James,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Back when I still investigated haunted sites, our team did this on
&gt;&gt; various occasions within a house where we recorded several hours of
&gt;&gt; activity over a few years (a long term investigation). We would
&gt;&gt; leave our audio equipment recording in several &quot;hot spots&quot; all over
&gt;&gt; the house and then leave for an hour or two. I have to say, in our
&gt;&gt; experience we never got an EVP while we were out of the house. As a
&gt;&gt; matter of fact we had an EVP when we reentered the house
&gt;&gt; saying, &quot;here they come, lets go&quot;. I don&#x27;t necessarily understand
&gt;&gt; why a ghost or spirit would talk with no one present to receive the
&gt;&gt; message unless during setup you explained what you are trying to
&gt;&gt; accomplish and what the spirits roll is in the experiment (we never
&gt;&gt; tried explaining). A piece of machinery (recorders) in an empty room
&gt;&gt; does not have a consciousness or spiritual presence I would be
&gt;&gt; interested to see if you get different results.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Regards,
&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;     To try and rule out that the EVP researchers are imprinting
&gt;&gt; voices
&gt;&gt;&gt; psychokinetically on audio players mistaken as ghosts voices, I
&gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt;&gt; pre-tape an interactive evp session.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I will record a bank of thirty questions, 20 seconds of silence
&gt;&gt;&gt; after each question, on a cassete tape and played on a cassette
&gt;&gt;&gt; player that will be utilized in all three buildings in a known
&gt;&gt;&gt; haunted location just outside of Phoenix, Arizona.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; There will be digital recorders, cassette recorders, omni
&gt;&gt;&gt; directional microphones, condensor microphones, as well as an
&gt;&gt;&gt; electrocet boom microphone present in all of the sessions. There
&gt;&gt;&gt; will be no human agents in the buildings when these sessions take
&gt;&gt;&gt; place.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; My hope is to:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Record an authentic EVP with no human agent in the building.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If this is phenomena driven, will the phenomena communicate by
&gt;&gt;&gt; responding to questions from a machine rather than a human agent?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have any ideas to enhance this experiment, please feel free
&gt;&gt;&gt; to let me know. This experiment will take place on October 27th.
