Yes Jill. Again thats just their opinion and experience. Perhaps for them t=
hey think they need to run if two hours before it gets anything. For others=
 its immediate. this is why I always tell people to run experiments, try di=
fferent things out and eventually you too will form your own opinion about =
what works best for you. 
=A0
There are NO experts in this feild of researc=
h just those who know more, those who know less, and those who think they k=
now everything =3D)
=A0
What works for me may not work for you and vice ver=
sa. So just try things out for yourselves and see where it takes you. Its a=
 fun journey.

Good luck!

Thanks, Misty!

I had =
a guy named Steve come through almost every session, so maybe he was my "te=
ch." The last session I had before the dry spell (when I quit for a while d=
ue to sickness), Steve was sort of flippant and gave a bunch of stupid answ=
ers, so now I'm kind of hoping he's gone on vacation. But I did two session=
s yesterday, and very little came through except for being told that a fami=
ly friend has died (I'm waiting to see if that bit of prediction has come t=
rue). So maybe, like you said, Steve "led" everyone and made things come th=
rough clearer. I guess time will tell. If he'd behave himself, I'd welcome =
him back.

So I'm wondering, what's the rationale behind this comment:

Fir=
st, the MiniBox works best with time. If you do not have two hours to devot=
e to a session, you might be disappointed. You should have the device runni=
ng in the place you will be using it for at least 15 minutes; during this t=
ime you can fine tune settings and volume. Never expect the Box to "Hit the=
 ground running," so to speak; it happens occasionally, that an operator ca=
n turn on the box and get an immediate message, but it hasn't happened ofte=
n in the ASUP's tests.

http://www.asup- inc.org/interimm iniboxreport. htm=


I can't imagine the above quote is good advice. The very first moment I t=
urned on my little hacked box, I got a clear, loud message: I see you. It f=
reaked me out so bad, I turned it off immediately and it took three days to=
 work up the nerve to try again! So I don't know what these people are talk=
ing about, that you can't hit the ground running. I've read about lots of f=
olks doing just that.

I was kind of thinking that shorter was better, too,=
 but I wanted to make sure, because if I was wrong, maybe letting it run a =
long time might get even better responses... but yeah, I think they get tir=
ed, as it probably takes a lot of effort to form those words.

I was also t=
hinking all those skeptics who say the boxes don't work are probably not tr=
eating their sessions like EVP -- I can never hear much of anything during =
the session, only afterward when I listen back and at very high volume. At =
least for me, most of the bulk of the communication is very, very quiet and=
 located in between the louder snippets of strong-signaled radio announcer =
voices. I imagine it might be louder and clearer if I took my set-up to a h=
aunted location (or some place lots of human emotions were felt), but since=
 my set-up isn't really geared for that, I haven't done it yet.

Do you guys find that it's better to do short sessions (15 minutes) or long=
