&gt;   I realize you have plenty of subjective anecdotal evidence.I don&#x27;t
&gt; consider that &#x27;hard evidence&#x27; however.  I am looking for something a little
&gt; more objective and less subject to influence and interpretations.
&gt;
&gt; And stop putting words in my mouth. A person can misinterpret something,
&gt; mistake something, or confuse something, without lying about something.  And
&gt; before you jump down my throat claiming I am saying all results are
&gt; mistakes, I am not.  I am performing experiments, keeping an open mind, and
&gt; considering all evidence I find.
&gt;
&gt; The way you have been attacking me by calling me names at every turn, just
&gt; because I try new things and don&#x27;t always agree with your world view, is
&gt; eerily reminiscent of the way the church of old tried to suppress new
&gt; thought and discoveries, except you&#x27;re just substituting the word &#x27;heretic&#x27;
&gt; with &#x27;science&#x27;. and &#x27;blasphemy&#x27; with anything that disagrees with you.
&gt;
&gt; There&#x27;s an old saying:  &quot;We become that which we hate&quot;.  So far, all you&#x27;ve
&gt; done is denounce people&#x27;s efforts to try new methods and see what works.
&gt; You accept nothing anyone else proposes if it does not agree with you.  That
&gt; is the realm of the extreme skeptic: the same skeptic you ridicule.
&gt;
&gt; You certainly don&#x27;t have to agree with my comments.  And I don&#x27;t have to
&gt; agree with yours.  But no one needs all the name calling Frank.   It really
&gt; adds nothing to support your theories.

&gt;  Yeah I know, science no accept anecdotes. There is plenty of hard
&gt; evidence, trouble, science don&#x27;t accept that either cuz they are taught, no
&gt; spirits, so there are no sprit voices, fact is fact is facts. Well that&#x27;s
&gt; about all there is in this field. Perhaps you should take bird watching or
&gt; something concrete. To not accept what others say is the same as calling us
&gt; all liars, and I find very insulting.
&gt;
&gt;  How irrational is it to ignore all evidence and continuously try to fit
&gt; the phenomon into a diffintion where it will not fit and does not belong,
&gt; and then claim you&#x27;re looking for a more rational explantation, it just does
&gt; not make sense. I say forget the BS &quot;science&quot; whatever that is, puts out and
&gt; try thinking on your own.  Mr Spock was a fictional charactor!

&gt;  If you completely ignore what everyone else in the whole wide freaking

&gt;   I don&#x27;t think I have enough data yet to make any conclusions, so I plan
&gt; more experiments.  Since there are different distinct claims about what the
&gt; box or the recorders can do, I try to make different distinct experiments
&gt; for each.
&gt;
&gt; Some people claim they can get the box to tell them things that the
&gt; operator couldn&#x27;t know, so my &quot;whats the object&quot; experiment is one way to
&gt; examine that.  Some people claim the boxes can make predictions, so
&gt; cataloging predictions and examining the results can help examine that.  If
&gt; there are other claims, I will try to figure experiments based on those.

&gt;  I get our last dogs from time to time, and used to get them via white
&gt; noise when I first started this. Last summer some kids came down into the
&gt; basement wiht the younger grandson, and the little yorkie barked, but &quot;get
&gt; outta here&quot; came out, some how.
&gt;
&gt;  Yeah, I think I was too hard on RJ. I don&#x27;t know why, but testing doens&#x27;t
&gt; seem to work, but we get enough to prove this to ourselves. It&#x27;s probably a
&gt; faith thing, although I&#x27;m not religious, even anti-religion.

&gt; Here is a short file, where someone says, &quot;Scamp, Scamp,&quot; then Scamp barks.
&gt; &quot;yap.&quot;  This little dog belonged to my grandma, when I was about 9 or 10
&gt; years old, he was a Manchester Terrier, and lived with us for many years,
&gt; and this is his bark for sure.  I&#x27;d know that bark anywhere.  Sorry, that I
&gt; can&#x27;t make it any clearer, I need to get one of those better ghost boxes I
&gt; guess.  RJ, spirits are just like us, they are not omnipresent like
&gt; God,  probably why David doesn&#x27;t want to play the guessing game, he has
&gt; better things to do over there, and has said, they have thousands of people
&gt; standing in this long line waiting to get into the Heavens, and He can&#x27;t
&gt; just drop His job and go to your house to see what you have over there, He
&gt; did tell me that first time what it was, and i sent it to you, but it was
&gt; too late.  It&#x27;s hard for me to understand them sometimes, He was also right
&gt; about that little boy, Syler being killed, and where his body would be
&gt; found, I don&#x27;t know what they did about it though. sf
