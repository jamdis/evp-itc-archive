It sounds like the recordings \nI do with a cell phone. I think you&#39;d have to be there to judge it. \n\n Personally I&#39;m always disappointed at my stuff being out there, and \nthe incredible lack of clarity obatained with it, to me that&#39;s a huge \nfailure! I know the stuff works, but how to get it to a level that can \nbe understood by most, that&#39;s the problem, and my focus at the moment. \nThe Mini Box is big step in that direction, so some of the pressure if \noff, but I still need to get my boxes to professional level. \n\n Frank-S"}
