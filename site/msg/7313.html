Frank,
Don't get discouraged. There is a reason that you are doing all of t=
his.
You might not understand it, but you are the one that is meant to
figu=
re this out.And your efforts and hard work are very much
appreciated, and r=
espected by alot of people.
Think about how far you have come with this ide=
a.
You can't give up because you know that you aren't finished yet.
Maybe s=
ome of the things that you hear are meant for you only.

 Tuner with white noise running. Ther=

had the antenna wire runing very close to=
 the RVG section.  Afterward I
replaced the antenna wire with coax to preve=
nt noise pick up from inside
the box. Oh yeah, manual tuing. 
 
 I know! Th=
ere's noisy crappy boxes out there, and I should have done
this testing lon=
g ago, but so many wanted to be like Chris Moon, and I
wanted to get the bo=
xes out there so others could experience it, and
experiment, but they funct=
ion so poorly as yet, and no one gets anything
close to what I do, or what =
Moon claims. So the TAPS article was correct
about the things being flawed,=
 but I'm working on it. I don't sell the
stuff, and never have, so all we'v=
e lost is time. I can't make many of
these, I can handle making them to tes=
t, and improve the thing, but I
dread just having to wire and wire and buil=
d and build endlessly. I
can't do that stuff anymore, just too brain fried.=
 
 
 The fact is, there are other methods that work as well, and probably
b=
etter. Often the voices are much clearer with the simple methods, and
they =
can be shared since most can hear them. I am endlessly discouraged
when I t=
hink I have a perfectly clear voice from the box, and not
another person in=
 the world can hear it.
