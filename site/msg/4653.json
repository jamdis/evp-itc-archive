I said there are hundreds of examples on line of  \nknown long exposures. When even a few of these are compared with  \nLuminator examples, I see a tremendous similarity. Do you?\n\n\n&gt; but there are a couple of dozen in Macy&#39;s book, &quot;Spirit Faces,&quot; and  \n&gt; yes, many many of them are open to wide interpretation,\n\nDoes that mean that you agree with my point? Because, as I reason  \nit,  they are either spirit extras or they aren&#39;t. They can&#39;t sort-of  \nbe spirit extras. I&#39;m not sure what other interpretations there might  \nbe in this instance.\n\n\n&gt; just as our humble recordings are.\n\n&gt;   In addition to that majority that make us say, &quot;Come on!{&quot; there  \n&gt; are a handful that make you say &quot;Hmmmmmmm. . . .&quot; Just like we  \n&gt; offer a handful of results from our endless recording efforts to  \n&gt; try to convince the hard-nosed.\n\nI&#39;d agree with you wholeheartedly, if I had ever seen one that did,  \nin fact, make me go, &quot;Hmmmm.&quot; As I said, I have never seen one where  \nthe sitter and the extra did not share a consistent set of features  \nand coloring. If you have any examples that do, and you can share  \nthem, I&#39;d be delighted to see them. I&#39;d like my opinion to be swayed.  \nReally, I would.\n\n&gt; I would think that many would see the Luminator efforts as a modern  \n&gt; effort at scrying.\n\nDo you mean scrying as in the psychomanteum method developed by  \nRaymond Moody? My understanding, from attending a presentation by Dr.  \nMoody, was that the psychomanteum produced full-blown apparitions  \nthat could converse with the bereaved. Not sure these two types of  \nevents are comparable.\n\n&gt; Everything we do crosses boundaries, and my point is that it&#39;s  \n&gt; really hard to walk the line between trying to be scientific and  \n&gt; trying to be open.  It&#39;s really, really hard! But if we give in one  \n&gt; area, we have to be willing to give in another.\n\nI don&#39;t think that is arguably true, Ursula. If the evidence appears  \ngood, I acknowledge it; if the evidence appears weak, I acknowledge  \nit. It is simply not true to say that a person cannot be both open- \nminded and scientific. I really do want to believe, but I won&#39;t  \nbelieve just because I want to. And because you, me, or anyone  \n&quot;gives&quot; in one area, does not make a phenomenon any more or less real.\n\nYour fellow traveler on this journey,\n\nAnn\n\n\n\n&gt; Ursula\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This is a classic example of the kind of photo that Mark thinks shows\n&gt; a spirit extra. To me, clearly, this is the same woman--same hair,\n&gt; same eyes, same mouth, same nose. Again, to me, it looks like a\n&gt; classic long exposure when compared with other known long exposures--\n&gt; I&#39;ve included just of hundreds of examples.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
