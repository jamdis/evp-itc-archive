Hi Margaret, 
  No problem, the pics are on their way. :)  This was the first setup of the method I have done.  I have extra hardware laying around here(yes, I'm a computer engineer geek ;) ) that I'll setup some other trials and test to run today as well.  I thought the live web feed was pretty interesting in the fact that I have someone else with positive energy working with me, even if it's remotely.  I've also done live feeds with my night vision cameras on a box research session with my friend.  I'm trying to work out the kinks in it so others can try it out with me if they want.  

  I haven't  heard of Lance Reed, at least I don't think I have, so thanks for the link.  I'll check out his site right now.  

Thanks,
Bryan

Hi Bryan.  Can you email it to me so I can see it too?  I only view the boards online, so I 
don't get anything that is sent out as an attachment.  Thanks!

There's a UK based researcher of "The Schreiber Method" named Lance Reed who has been 
getting good results with video loop.  Have you ever checked out his site?
