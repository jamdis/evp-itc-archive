&gt;  I think I&#x27;ll start making a distinction between the typical  
&gt; paranormal investigator moron, and ITC. The paranormal twits seem  
&gt; to have no concept of what spirit acutally is, and how it&#x27;s  
&gt; possible to communicate. I&#x27;m tired to arguing with the idiots. I  
&gt; can&#x27;t get past their huge egos to make teh point that it&#x27;s not  
&gt; white noise, and spirits can travel. I just had another go round  
&gt; with one of Rosemary Guiley&#x27;s friends, her tech, these people just  
&gt; can&#x27;t hear what I&#x27;m trying to say.

&gt;
&gt; Paranormal Experts??? Is there such a thing, are we talking about
&gt; the field that has ideas and theories and no solid evidence of
&gt; anything to back it up? It&#x27;s like being an expert at something that
&gt; you can&#x27;t prove exists in the first place. We would have a better
&gt; shot of being an expert at picking the winning lottery numbers than
&gt; proving to someone that an afterlife exists.

&gt; &gt; Yeah, he&#x27;s got the grumpy attitude! I just wanted to get some

&gt; Unfrotunate that it&#x27;ll probably create some demand.

&gt; last night, they should come up if you do a search on Ghost Box,
&gt; Frank&#x27;s box, ITC, EVP, or paranormal, or maybe &quot;PurpleAlienGirl&quot;
&gt; (user name). It&#x27;s my first attempt, so I&#x27;m not sure if it worked,
&gt; and it&#x27;s blocked here at work. BTW, I&#x27;m not sure if the Purple
&gt; Princess stuff puts people off, that&#x27;s who my guys say I am, and I
&gt; accept that as an axiom. As if it matters, but that&#x27;s an &quot;other
