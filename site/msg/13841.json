Asking for a \n                  specific, predetermined number is not=\r\n subjective.&nbsp; It is \n                  about as objective as you can g=\r\net. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not trying to \n                  prove anything, or rule o=\r\nut any possibilities.&nbsp; I am \n                  suggesting a method to =\r\ndetermine, statistically, how accurate \n                  someone=E2=80=99s=\r\n board, or methodology, might be.&nbsp; Lets say I \n                  selec=\r\nt two people, and in separate rooms, I give each a \n                  spell=\r\ning test.&nbsp; Person 1 gets 100% right.&nbsp; Person 2 \n                 =\r\n gets 50% right.&nbsp; Now, if I later give them a second \n                =\r\n  spelling test, I can start with the theory that Person 1 will \n          =\r\n        get near 100% correct, and Person 2 will get near 50% \n            =\r\n      correct.&nbsp; This doesn=E2=80=99t mean they will, or that they have=\r\n \n                  gotten these scores in the past.&nbsp; But statisticall=\r\ny, it \n                  is a reasonable assumption at this point.&nbsp; Af=\r\nter the \n                  second test, I can examine the deviation of the =\r\nresults from \n                  the first test, and update the statistics.&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; If the \n                  deviation remains small (if the resul=\r\nts remain similar), then \n                  I can more and more safely assu=\r\nme that person 1 will have a \n                  very high chance of getting=\r\n a word right, and person 2 will \n                  have half that.&nbsp; I=\r\nf the deviation swings wildly, than my \n                  statistics may no=\r\nt be very predictive after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The \n                  same is true =\r\nwith the board.&nbsp; As you said, getting this \n                  number w=\r\nrong doesn=E2=80=99t say past answers were wrong, or that \n                =\r\n  future answers will be wrong.&nbsp; And it is possible it \n              =\r\n    could have been right by mere chance (though very unlikely: \n          =\r\n        winning the lottery is more likely than guessing one number \n      =\r\n            out of a billion).&nbsp; What we=E2=80=99d have is one single \n=\r\n                  objective data point.&nbsp; It gives a starting point for=\r\n \n                  reasonable assumptions.&nbsp; As you noted, after more =\r\nsuch \n                  tests, those assumptions may start changing.&nbsp; =\r\nIt would be \n                  interesting to see how they change, if they =\r\n\n                  do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Different people seem to have different feeli=\r\nngs \n                  about the board.&nbsp; Some believe it gives great \n=\r\n                  results.&nbsp; Some are suspicious, even dubious.&nbsp; A=\r\nnd \n                  there are plenty of opinions in between.&nbsp; My tes=\r\nt is not \n                  for those who believe it is statistically likel=\r\ny that psychic \n                  tampering would occur, or that the board=\r\n=E2=80=99s performance is just \n                  not testable, which is th=\r\ne camp I gather you are in.&nbsp; My \n                  test is only good f=\r\nor that segment of this population who \n                  believes or wonde=\r\nrs if the board is capable of giving a \n                  straight objectiv=\r\ne answer to a straight objective questions, \n                  and that suc=\r\nh performance is testable.&nbsp; To address one of \n                  your =\r\nexamples, while it cannot show that an entity is reading \n                 =\r\n my mind if it gets the numbers right, it can conversely show \n            =\r\n      that an actual entity is not reading my mind (or that it is \n        =\r\n          not performing remote viewing, or that it is not predicting \n    =\r\n              the future of what the right answer is when it is revealed, o=\r\nr \n                  that it is not being forthright in its answers) if it =\r\ncannot \n                  get the numbers right in the first place.&nbsp; B=\r\nut if these \n                  things are true, then it begs the question o=\r\nf its accuracy \n                  anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So again, this is one data=\r\n point, in what could \n                  be a number of tests, for those wh=\r\no are not ruling out that \n                  testing is possible, and even =\r\ndesirable, when believing, or \n                  acting on, information gat=\r\nhered by using this kind of \n                  board.&nbsp;
