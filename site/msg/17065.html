I got some "hard evidence" last June and through=
out the rest of 2009. We obtained/ photographed and have unretouched photos=
 from within our home, K meter readings, videos of our lights & stereo/tv t=
urning itself off and on , including changing channels with NO person being=
 responsible, NO intereference that could have caused it and outside witnes=

feel things are left out, I will always answer questions! * smile * We have=
 hours of recordings, both video and audio, of the goings ons in our home a=

<DIV> I have gotten "voices" that I thought were perfectly clear=

sometimes they can have sychronistic meaning, and sometimes they can b=
e altered in some way to form a messages, such as the recent one I had abou=
t learning sex, which was seemingly ignored by all cuz it has the "s" word-=

<DIV> When I first switched to =
a linear sweep in the boxes, I could hear nothing but gibberish, then sudde=

 either, I think the mind(which is not brain) has to reprogram the ears, wh=
ich are brain, to hear.  I also think the skeptics can not allow this =
programming to take place, hence they can't hear. I would be very surprised=
 if any of the hard core skeptics even turned on a box for fear that they m=

wanted a box to test, or more like debunk. That crap is frikkin' pathe=
