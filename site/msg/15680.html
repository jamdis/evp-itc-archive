Hi Jill

Welcome to the group. You have alot of questions and many will no=
 doubt
try to answer them, I will say that eventually you will find your ow=
n
answers to your questions. Recording evp is a personal experience and so
=
I will try to answer based on MY own personal experiences. Other peoples
an=
swers may vary based upon what they experience.  Take it all with a
grain o=
f salt and develop your own viewpont.

tantly in the background,
mostly my last name -- is this normal?
1- Yes as =
I said its a personal experience and most often our names are
used as well =
as names of others. First names middle names last names,
nicknames. When we=
 physically speak to one another use of names is
usually to get that person=
s attentions and focus them on what is said.


> 2) They asked me to do the=
 sessions at night -- is this because it
works better at night because radi=
o waves travel further then, and have
you found this to be so?
2- I think t=
hat day to night radio frequencies do differ in strength
based on factors s=
uch as humidity or the earths atmosphere. Others will
chime in on their the=
ories about that. However I use several different
methods besides radio and=
 I still find that the strength of the
communication has more to do with th=
e person doing the session. Day to
day (or night) that can change. Some day=
s/nights are better and clearer
than others. I only record when I am well f=
ocused, not sick, tired
etcetera. Sometimes when I record during the daytim=
e they may ask I
return and try again at night and the improvements are not=
iced by my
ears.


> 3) They say things repeatedly, over and over again, as=
 if to make a
pattern I can pick out of the radio noise -- do you guys find=
 this is
the case?
3- The more you do this you will notice you develop an e=
ar for hearing
better as well as the amount of information and the clarity =
increases.
As we learn. we change our vibration and once a persons eyes are=
 open
they can see much more clearly.


> 4) Often there seems to be a dela=
y between asking the question and
getting the answer, or I get the wrong an=
swer, almost as if they can't
hear me properly. The answer can come before =
the question is asked, or
after the second question; or I can ask them to s=
ay THEIR name, and they
say MY name instead. Do you guys have these communi=
cation problems? Is
there any way to improve things?
4- They have stated th=
at they hear quite well. They do not need me to
speak the words to hear the=
 question. I on the other hand am the one who
does not "hear" them complete=
ly. They also said that the perfect speech
is the one without words but tha=
t I am not telepathic enough to always
hear them clearly. There are also so=
me statements in regards to my being
"there" as well as "here" simultaneous=
ly. Time does not exist for energy
aside from what we set upon our physical=
 existence as markers of birth,
death, sunrise, sunset, etcetera. Take away=
 the physics and what is
time? Again feel free to develop your own ideas on=
 that.


> 5) I find it interesting that the quality of what's said sounds
=
robotic instead of like the other radio snippets. When there is more
than o=
ne part to what's said, the first part goes up, as if to signify
I'm to wai=
t for the second part, which is often after some radio noise,
and usually i=
n the same tone and voice as the first part. Rarely do I
get two syllables =
together. Will this improve with time?
5- The more you put into it the more=
 you will get out of it. Over time
YOU will improve. You have alot of quest=
ions and your mind is filled
with a bit of chaos as we all are. We often th=
ink in fragmented forms of
speech. A group of ideas/thoughts then becomes a=
 physical form of speech
based on our use of physical body. The tongue, the=
 lips, the voicebox
etcetera. Imagine if you had to speak without your phys=
ical apparatus
and make use of what methods you can to be heard whether tho=
ughts,
dreams, sound waves, or even Frank's box. Quite often when a new spe=
aker
comes forth a bit of a training session can be heard for how they can
=
speak so that my physical self can hear what is said.


> 6) Is it normal f=
or entities to leave halfway through your
conversation? My dad's friend gre=
eted me tonight, halfway through made a
comment about "people just don't ca=
re, Jill," then left (I believe my
grandmother, or someone claiming to be h=
er, told me he left). Where do
they go? And when I ask about my brother, I'=
m repeatedly told "Brother's
in bed" and "Can't come." Has anyone been told=
 stuff like this?
6- At the beginning it was many voices, all speaking at o=
nce.
Multilayers of voices and it was very hard for me to hear without
focu=
sing on each individually. Now I ask they speak with one voice.
Often one p=
ersons voice tones begins a sentence and others end the train
of thought. I=
 find when they speak as one it is much clearer and longer
statements. I fo=
cus less on tone of voice and more on what is being
said.

Just because the=
 body dies doesn't mean the souls learning is complete
and perhaps your bro=
ther is in a state of rest, or exploration. Perhaps
he has already come thr=
u but you just did not recognize him without his
body's "tone of voice". I =
can't answer that question it will take more
exploration on your part.

> 7=
) Nearly all of the answers to my questions can't be heard in real
time, bu=
t only when I play the tape back. I'd say only about 5% of the
answers are =
loud and clear enough I can make them out and respond
appropriately during =
the session -- most of the answers are soft, and
come on or just above the =
quieter stations that are tuned. Will this
improve with time?
7- As I said =
the more you do this the more you develop an ear for the
communication bein=
g sent to your ears. In time you will notice your own
improvements on recor=
dings as well as off.


> OK, sorry for the extremely long post, but I'm ve=
ry frustrated and
excited at the same time. I also wanted to say a great bi=
g Thank You to
Frank for inventing this thing: If it wasn't for you, I woul=
dn't have
spoken to what I think was my grandmother today. Thanks for that,=
 and
for being a "real" and genuine person who selflessly shares your
resea=
rch with others. I for one am very grateful!
Frank S. is a very generous pe=
rson. He shares because he wants to and
most people respect him for his con=
tributions to this feild of research.
As for me I like him for his blunt ho=
nesty.  [:D]
