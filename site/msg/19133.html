<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Such as those that think real EVP can only be received using white noise
might want to do some real research starting with natural radio and what are
call spherics and whistlers, or pulses generated by lightening and other
&quot;natural&quot; EMF sources. Some,  will no doubt claim their system operates at
such a high frequency that it can not get the low frequency EMFs of natural
radio--wrong again. This stuff covers the whole the spectrum from DC to
light, and those little whispers are mostly just RF noise from natural and
man made sources, you can even get the noise from big planets, here on
Earth, from Jupiter and Saturn.  Get a sound  that might seem like singing
and I am pretty sure it&#x27;s just what is called a &quot;whistler&quot;, probably from
terrestrial lightening. The thunderstorm can be anywhere, this stuff
propagates just like radio, and there are hundreds of thunderstorms all over
the planet at any given moment.  Everytime an electric motor starts, or a
florescent light, or a car starts, anything that uses electricity, there is
going to be a magnetic field radiated.  How many electric lights are in the
world going on and off!?  How about in a factory, large shop, lab, or
manufacturing/research facility?Lots and lots of magnetic/electric pulses.

 Then, to make it worse, people claim be touched during investigations might
want to investigate static electricity!  Clothes generate electric fields as
we move around, normally it goes unnoticed, but moving around in the dark
listening and feeling for anything, you might think you&#x27;re being touched, or
your clothes moved. Could it be just the static electricity causing
attraction and/or repulsion of areas of clothing?  I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s
what *it is*. Just be sure, and to get the pure experience, I think all
ghost investigations should be done naked to eliminate all static
electricity from clothing. :-O

 I know, sounds like debunking, but ya have to stop and think sometimes.
Some of these effects we feel and hear can be caused by natural magnetic and
electric sources. Then, make it worse cuz we can create, via thought forms,
just what we want to experience. One must control one&#x27;s emotions!

 There are some that have established themselves as experts based on white
noise EVP. To maintain position they may claim only white noise EVP is
acceptable and pure.  What is white noise? A frikkin&#x27; raw audio in it&#x27;s
simplest form, so why not use higher level sounds and get higher level
voices? When you get voices giving names, answering questions, and even
cussing and swearing, I am pretty sure &quot;the box&quot; as it&#x27;s come to be known
beats the be-geeesies out of white noise BS. Yes, you can get broadcast
fragments, and bits that can be mistaken, but with white noise, you can get
all kinds of weak noise pulses that probably say nothing, but you are
desperately trying to interpret. It&#x27;s been my experience that the more one
filters and cleans a recording, the more these noises sound intelligible. If
you have to filter it just to hear if it is saying anything--forget about
it!  I think our own minds and psi ability--can--- influence the sounds and
create a meaning where there was none.

 Spirit exists in a higher dimension, as such they have full access to our
level and can easily manipulate sound and everything else. We are limited,
they are not. That&#x27;s why I focus on higher level, more energetic phenomenon
and ignore stuff like white noise EVP or orbs. Paranormal experience is more
dictated by what one can accept than anything else,  by what one fears as
well.


 Wait for it! Wait for it! Here it comes-- the threats of law suits and how
dare you question......

 Am I an expert--hell no, ex===has been, &#x27;spert==drip under pressure. I
don&#x27;t want to be a &quot;paranormal expert&quot;

Such as hose ha hink eal EVP can only be ecei ed using whi e noise migh wan o do some eal esea ch s a ing wi h na u al adio and wha a e call sphe ics and whis le s, o pulses gene a ed by ligh ening and o he &quot;na u al&quot; EMF sou ces. Some,  will no doub claim  hei sys em ope a es a such a high equency ha i can no ge he low equency EMFs o na u al adio--w ong again. This s u co e s he whole he spec um om DC o ligh , and hose li le whispe s a e mos ly jus RF noise om na u al and man made sou ces, you can e en ge   he noise om big plane s, he e on Ea h, om Jupi e and Sa u n.  Ge a sound  ha migh seem like singing and I am p e y su e i &#x27;s jus wha is called a &quot;whis le &quot;, p obably om e es ial ligh ening. The hunde s o m can be anywhe e, his s u p opaga es jus like adio, and he e a e hund eds o hunde s o ms all o e he plane a any gi en momen .  E e y ime an elec ic mo o s a s, o a lo escen ligh , o a ca s a s, any hing ha uses elec ici y, he e is going o be a magne ic ield adia ed.  How many elec ic ligh s a e in he wo ld going on and o !?  How abou in a ac o y, la ge shop, lab, o manu ac u ing/ esea ch acili y?Lo s and lo s o magne ic/elec ic pulses.

 
 Then, o make i wo se, people claim be ouched du ing in es iga ions migh wan o in es iga e s a ic elec ici y!  Clo hes gene a e elec ic ields as we mo e a ound, no mally i goes unno iced, bu  mo ing a ound in he da k lis ening and eeling o any hing, you migh hink you&#x27; e being ouched, o you clo hes mo ed. Could i be jus he s a ic elec ici y causing a ac ion and/o epulsion o a eas o clo hing?  I&#x27;m no saying ha &#x27;s wha i is. Jus be su e, and o ge he pu e expe ience, I hink all ghos in es iga ions should be done naked o elimina e all s a ic elec ici y om clo hing. :-O 

 
 I know, sounds like debunking, bu ya ha e o s op and hink some imes.  Some o hese e ec s we eel and hea can be caused by na u al magne ic and elec ic sou ces. Then, make i wo se cuz we can c ea e, ia hough o ms, jus wha we wan o expe ience. One mus con ol one&#x27;s emo ions! 

 
 The e a e some ha ha e es ablished hemsel es as expe s based on whi e noise EVP. To main ain posi ion hey may claim only whi e noise EVP is accep able and pu e.  Wha is whi e noise? A ikkin&#x27; aw audio in i &#x27;s simples o m, so why no use highe le el sounds and ge highe le el oices? When you ge oices gi ing names, answe ing ques ions, and e en cussing and swea ing, I am p e y su e &quot; he box&quot; as i &#x27;s come o be known bea s he be-geeesies ou o whi e noise BS. Yes, you can ge b oadcas agmen s, and bi s ha can be mis aken, bu wi h whi e noise, you can ge all kinds o weak noise pulses ha p obably say no hing, bu you a e despe a ely ying o in e p e . I &#x27;s been my expe ience ha he mo e one il e s and cleans a eco ding, he mo e hese noises sound in elligible. I you ha e o il e i jus o hea i i is saying any hing-- o ge abou i !  I hink ou own minds and psi abili y--can--- in luence he sounds and c ea e a meaning whe e he e was none. 

 
 Spi i exis s in a highe dimension, as such hey ha e ull access o ou le el and can easily manipula e sound and e e y hing else. We a e limi ed, hey a e no . Tha &#x27;s why I ocus on highe le el, mo e ene ge ic phenomenon and igno e s u like whi e noise EVP o o bs. Pa ano mal expe ience is mo e dic a ed by wha one can accep han any hing else,  by wha one ea s as well. 

 
 
 Wai   o i ! Wai o i ! He e i comes-- he h ea s o law sui s and how da e you ques ion......
 
 Am I an expe --hell no, ex===has been, &#x27;spe ==d ip unde p essu e. I don&#x27; wan o be a &quot;pa ano mal expe &quot;
