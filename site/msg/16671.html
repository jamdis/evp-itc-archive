&gt;       I mounted mine in a PVC pipe and it makes a good resonator to boot.
&gt; 
&gt; I was inspired by what I saw on Ghost Adventures  They had a Pipe a couple feet long and the bottom half of the radio was stuck in a slot on its side, near the center.  The sound comes out the open ends.  That inspired me to install my own multi component layout in a similar pipe I had and use it also for a resonator. (the white pipe looks better painted black)  I cut the slots with a drill and dremmel tool.
&gt; 
&gt; My results speak for themselves (see my photo)
