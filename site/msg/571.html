<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

I just entered the group and I&#x27;m interested in EVP. I have very 
little experience and would appreciate some help.

With my limited knowledge in electronics I built a white noise 
generator (with high frequency filtering) and I&#x27;m trying to use it to 
record voices with the PC/sound blaster. I did few attempts and so 
far I didn&#x27;t found anything unusual. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m doing 
everything right. The recorded sound is very noisy (as expected) and 
I&#x27;m not sure I would be able to detect any voice, even using headphones.

What sound sources produce best results? Does anyone have experience 
in using a white noise generator?
Does the sound have to be recorded in a analogical tape recorder or 
it can be recorded digitally?

Thank you,
Jaime
