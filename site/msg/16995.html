I don't know if Frank's question regarding experience was to myself or to D=
wayne. 
In case it was to me, here is a brief summary of my work.
=A0
I hav=
e=A0been involved with Parapsychology research=A0for about 4 decades. 
Duri=
ng that time I have conducted experiments in ESP and PK including some 
gro=
undbreaking=A0research on real-time PK and remote PK studies with gifted su=
bjects. 
I have also conducted quite a bit of research on mediumship, theor=
ies of survival, 
EVP as a matter of fact and the belief systems which seem=
 to contribute to all of this. 
The Ouija work was an outgrowth of the PK r=
esearch involving several test groups.
=A0
While I don't=A0argue for a spec=
ific interpretation of any ability or phenomenon, 
I do think it's importan=
t to offer what is known from Parapsychology lab research.
This is far from=
 any form of 'debunking per se. Rather it is an attempt 
to offer an explan=
ation grounded at least in some careful studies. 
That explanation is still=
 anomalous; it is not something that would make 
a skeptic very happy. But =
it is at least based on repeated tests which seem 
to show outcomes consist=
ent with predictions - =A0the basis of experimental technique.
=A0
Hope tha=
t helps clarify things a bit.
