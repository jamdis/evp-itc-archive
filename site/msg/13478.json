However I am in need of some \n&gt; schematics. \n&gt; &gt; Where could I find those?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tom in WIsconsin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Hey Tom,\n&gt; I&#39;m new here so I just saw your message. I have downloaded several \n&gt; schematics from the internet for different versions of the box as I \n&gt; could find them. If you want me to send them along to you, drop me \na \n&gt; line. Like you, I want to build one but I lack the expertise and \n&gt; knowledge when it comes to electronics so not only do I have to \nfind \n&gt; the right box to build, but also someone to help me out with \n&gt; constructing it as well. \n&gt; I have a group here in the La Crosse area but both of my techs left \n&gt; to start their own group with some of our other members. So much \nfor \n&gt; my tech department. Anyway, let me know if you want me to send them \n&gt; along to you. They are all in pdf format. Take care and we&#39;ll talk \n&gt; with you again soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mark Waldenberger\n&gt;"}
