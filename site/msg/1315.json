We will\nalways have people saying such things and fighting with them only\nnegatively effects your own contact field. In the end you will not\nconvince them of anything.\n\nIn my case I answer what I think are legitimate questions from sincere\npeople. Some of those turn out to be the naysayers who want to argue,\nI drop the conversation and move on. \n\nI look at it this way. If they have to ask how it works then they\ndon&#39;t know and feel enough to understand anything I would have to tell\nthem. They think it is a completely &quot;technical&quot; process, when the most\nimportant components are the links between the two communicators.\n\nAs Misty and I have talked about in the past I was one who use to jump\nat any opportunity to &quot;fight the skeptics&quot;. I have since learned that\nit is a pointless waste of energy and it does do damage to your\ncontact field or bridge if you have established one. The turmoil and\nnegative emotions controversy spawns are not conducive to the types of\ncommunications we have been experimenting with.\n\nSome of those skeptics genuinely want to learn what we know but just\ncan&#39;t grasp the basics needed to perpetuate this reality. Others just\nwant to get you worked up and off balance. By ignoring negative\ncontacts you are protecting your connection to your higher self. Don&#39;t\nfall for their traps!\n\nBest Regards,\n\nFrank Ratka\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot;\n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; hi guy&#39;s\n&gt; It seems that franks box and the sweep method are not to poular with \n&gt; a few closed minded and self appointed paranormal truth seekers in \n&gt; other words individuals who can not accomplish anything on thier own \n&gt; as far as paranormal research is concerned so they feel they must \n&gt; lash out at others who open mindedly try new and mostly unexplored \n&gt; methods od spirit communication and investigation. they have no basis \n&gt; for thier attacks but to say I work in the electronics field and \n&gt; franks box is impossible it can not work and the am sweep is just \n&gt; catching bits of words that your mind is naturaly putting together as \n&gt; phrases. What I would like them to explain is how the messages \n&gt; recieved in this manner pertain to my individual life , family and \n&gt; name and how can anyone explain what is so far to my knowledge \n&gt; unexplainable. Anyway enough venting. This began as a good hearted \n&gt; post on another paranormal forum in hopes of spurring some \n&gt; researchers like myself that were unaware of these methods to maybe \n&gt; give them a try. I was immediatly attacked like by a pack of wolves \n&gt; claiming to be so called electronic experts and self appointed \n&gt; debunkers of fraud when all I did was to explain my experience with \n&gt; the method and not to give a fact based report on it&#39;s validity but \n&gt; to give my personal experience with it. WHY CAN&#39;T WE ALL JUST GET \n&gt; ALONG !!!\n&gt; \n&gt; bruce\n&gt;"}
