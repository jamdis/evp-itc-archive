I don&#39;t think spirit is omnipresent, they are not God or\n&gt; Holy\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Spirit, maybe they can&#39;t see everywhere, but only make guesses, like\n&gt; most\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; people do, unless they have some necessary information to give, like\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ones with the info. on the missing girl last year.

There&#39;s way to much expectation created in trying to\n&gt; guess,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; so participants minds interfere with whatever spirit communication\n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; might be. You do not understand how this communcations works, nor do\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; understand the effects of the observer, you can not seperate the\n&gt; observer\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; from the event in the pararnormal. therefore any results are\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; invalid--before you go puffing your chest out thinking how clever you\n&gt; are in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; debunking spirit communication. Even your own expectation that no\n&gt; valid\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; information will be received is enough to block all information. But\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; usual, skeptic/debunker ignore all!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; On Mon, Jul 19, 2010 at 1:03 PM, &lt;SnowfireL@aol. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; RJ.

This experiment asked for participants to determine what\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; object was. Vague or partial answers would not be counted (for\n&gt; example, just\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; giving a color, shape, size, what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re looking\n&gt; for what\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#39;t\n&gt; count.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other\n&gt; means\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; they chose.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the\n&gt; start\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; group. The idea with this file is that you could download it at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; beginning of the experiment and &#39;keep it safe&#39; on your computer. Then\n&gt; at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; end of the experiment, I would post the password so you can reveal\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; contents of the file. That way, you were in control of the original\n&gt; image\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; during the entire time, not me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Passworded pdf: http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; RJ/RJ20100716. pdf&lt;\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.pdf&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The password for that file is: 2plus2isFour\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Instructions, if you need them for the other files, are also in that\n&gt; RJ\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; folder.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So to the results:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Number of participants: 6\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Total tries: 29\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Ambiguous answers: 0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Correct answers: 0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Object: Chair\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Object picture: http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; RJ/RJ20100716. jpg&lt;\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.jpg&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; As a little side experiment, on Monday I also asked if anyone had\n&gt; gotten\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; any answers that might indicate an article of clothing (though I did\n&gt; not say\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; why I was asking). One theory is that the human operator can be\n&gt; influenced\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; by things they already know or suspect, and so interpret audio with\n&gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; own personal &#39;educated guesses&#39;, that would differ from what they\n&gt; would hear\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; had they not known those things. This side experiment did indicate\n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; support for that theory, since before I mentioned &#39;articles of\n&gt; clothing&#39;, no\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; one included an article of clothing in their results. But after I\n&gt; mentioned\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; it, several reports of clothing began to appear. I did not add these\n&gt; tries\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to the results above.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement,\n&gt; let\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; me know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this\n&gt; experiment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI ha e some eally wei d hings a ound he e i I e e decided o do such an expe imen , such as a 1 1/2 inch G eenlee chassis punch.
