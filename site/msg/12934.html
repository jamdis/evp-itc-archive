Greetings fellow researchers,

I hope everyone had a safe and Happy Thanks=
giving!
You know me, give me a day off and I'll build another prototype dev=
ice.
This time I built a Ge transistor device for energy capture. It's
simi=
lar to my Diode Device #3.
I call this one Transistor Device #1.  A quick t=
est with the plasma lamp
showed me it worked,
so now I'll need to do a bit =
more 'real' testing.
I've added pictures and the schematic to the last two =
pages of my
FREE Little Book of Paranormal Prototypes. (Now up to 18 pages.=
)

Here's the link:
