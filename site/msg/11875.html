<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just wondering if you guys have ever experienced anything like what
I&#x27;m about to describe.

I was doing an investigation at a cemetery the other night. My
girlfriend was using the 469 with headphones. It started to spook her
a little and she gave me the box. I put in the headphones and didn&#x27;t
hear anything out of the normal radio scan. Then I heard footsteps
circling me. I started looking around and asked if anyone else was
hearing them. I then got attacked by an entity in the cemetery. It
felt a lot like a schoolyard bully circling you before he hits you,
and then a big rush of  energy. I can&#x27;t really describe the feeling. 

Then, the other night I was on a separate investigation and was in a
bathroom. I was hearing water dripping, but when I checked the
possible sources they were bone dry. 

Is it possible that these noises can come clearly through the 469? I
do not have any psychic ability I know of. They are very real, and are
definitely happening, not being imagined. Maybe it has something to do
with the headphones? I cannot explain this. Have any of you had a
similar experience?</pre>
