<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Translation--don&#x27;t do any recordings of my own.. Yet, critique others
results.  I have gotten predictions that did in fact come true, but like a
skeptic moron, I thought no frikkin&#x27; way and didn&#x27;t post it.

&gt;
&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t waste anyone&#x27;s time  by posting a bunch of radio snippets that
&gt; &quot;Sound like something&quot;.  I would post one if it ever actually seemed proof
&gt; of intelligent communication to me: for example, a bunch of consistent
&gt; predictions, posted before the event, read by all, then confirmed
&gt; afterwards.  That would be the only worthwhile thing to post that I can
&gt; think of.
&gt;
&gt; Since I have never gotten anything like that, I have not posted it.
&gt;
&gt; And I notice neither have you.

&gt; &quot;I think your instinct to stop posting this stuff might have been a good
&gt; one. I suspect you are feeling a bit overwhelmed with this field right now,
&gt; and it may be something is nagging at you inside someplace, saying it is a
&gt; waste of your time or a burden on your life and health, or that you just
&gt; need a little more space for a while.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;  It&#x27;s a knowing we all have, that there&#x27;s something to this, that it&#x27;s
&gt; amazing, yet remains unprovable to others.

&gt;&gt; &quot;*I do not control what spirits say though, after all they are just

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; *Actually, it&#x27;s more interesting than that.  Not only do you not control
&gt;&gt; what the &#x27;spirits&#x27; say, you also don&#x27;t control what broadcast radio says,
&gt;&gt; and to a large extent you don&#x27;t control what your brain finds and interprets
&gt;&gt; in the noise you are hearing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I listened to these (trying not to look at the labels, since once a person
&gt;&gt; looks at the labels, they prime their brains to interpret the sounds in YOUR
&gt;&gt; way, not their own way).  To me, they were either just a mess of random
&gt;&gt; radio snippets, exactly what you&#x27;d expect if a 3 year old were randomly
&gt;&gt; twisting the radio dial, or they were just noise.  Nothing paranormal in the
&gt;&gt; least.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In any case, I&#x27;d recommend a break: take a nice month off.  See how you
&gt;&gt; feel being away from all this for a while.  Come back fresh if you feel ok
&gt;&gt; after that.  But if you feel obsessed when away, it might be good to ask
&gt;&gt; your friends and loved ones for some opinions on what they see in you.  Your
&gt;&gt; health is more important than anything here anyways, and you can&#x27;t really do
&gt;&gt; a job with interpretation of your results, much less your other
&gt;&gt; responsibilities in life, unless you put your health first.

&gt;&gt; *Well, got no response out of the other list, let&#x27;s see if any of you
&gt;&gt; folks on these lists can hear these at all. They may be too fast, but I did
&gt;&gt; try to slow them a bit,  I know, these are very hard to hear, got them last
&gt;&gt; night in response to Steve&#x27;s letter about all the &quot;religious&quot;  crap I&#x27;ve
&gt;&gt; been sending,  such weird files I sometimes send in lately.  I do not
&gt;&gt; control what spirits say though, after all they are just people too.  Got
&gt;&gt; one on here that&#x27;s really funny, I think it has a little demon on it too, he
&gt;&gt; seems very angry, and wants someone to &quot;Let me out!  Let me out!&quot; is what he
&gt;&gt; is saying, I think he is wanting to come after some folks, because, even
&gt;&gt; demon&#x27;s believe in God.  He really sounds mad at some people and wants
&gt;&gt; &quot;.....out,&quot; just going to let you hear it, may need to play it several times
&gt;&gt; to hear, but I think its kinda cute. I told them what some on the lists
&gt;&gt; were saying, and this was the response.  btw  Is someone going to Florida ?
&gt;&gt; The last one says something about FL Hope you all enjoy them. sf*
