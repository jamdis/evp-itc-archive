Keep the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; electricity, but, we should work on building more Solar panel&#39;s on\n&gt; homes,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wind\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; turbines, and at least be granted big discounts by government to have\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; these\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things installed in our homes. People would lose some jobs, but they\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; could do\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; similar without all the stress, Pilots could take on crop dusting for\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; while, lol forest and land developers could become growers, planters\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; new\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; trees. Stop tearing out mountains for awhile, let the trees take root,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; so\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; what if we must go the long way for awhile or things take more time,\n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; would be less land slides. With less driving would be less need for\n&gt; oil,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; less pumping, stop with the fishing for awhile too, over 90% of the\n&gt; oceans\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are now being over harvested! If we could stop eating so much of any\n&gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; thing, things could improve, thing is, this whole world would need to\n&gt; see\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things this way in order to save itself. We may not be getting as warm\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as we\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; think, even worse we are more then likely going into an ice age if we\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; not careful, and the world is becoming off balance, or is shifting,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; just\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; melting away without it&#39;s internal support system.

When you look at the weather, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; earthquakes,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the actions of humanity--getting dumber and dumber by the day, the\n&gt; active\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; debunking going on, the lack of news coverage for comets--it begins to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; look\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; like something is going on. I don&#39;t buy the Jesus stuff either, but\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t negate the facts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As far other planets in the solar system, I think &quot;science&quot; has it all\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wrong, I think most are habitable in some form. I got voices saying\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; came\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; from the sixth planet, presumably in this system, and once again I\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ask, how would anyone else &quot;know better&quot;? I don&#39;t believe constant and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; daily\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Earthquakes are the norm, or they wouldn&#39;t be mentioned in the bible\n&gt; as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sign of the times. I think this planet is severely fractured, and very\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; little\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; holding it together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; What happens when you don&#39;t keep moving parts lubricated--as in\n&gt; pulling\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; out all the natural oil of the planet? I think we are living on a\n&gt; future\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; asteroid belt as it ceases up and flies apart. Yet again, how would\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; anyone\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;know better&quot;? With only a slight amount of research, anyone can punch\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; holes in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; every &quot;scientific&quot; theory all day long. Some dweeb in a university has\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; thought and it becomes gospel. Some duffus does a &quot;thought experiment&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; it&#39;s irrefutable--how the f--- does that work!? You think it,\n&gt; therefore\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is by virture of titles and degree? If you don&#39;t have titles and\n&gt; degrees,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; anything you think of is nonsensical.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; yeah, rambling of a lunatickingnutcase.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nNo, hey a e made o ca alin, which is aguely simila o bakeli e bu is made by a di e en p ocess.
