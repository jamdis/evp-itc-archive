&gt; &quot;captue&quot; it with the digital camera in camcorder mode.  As with the  
&gt; voices, you can&#x27;t rule out with 100% certainty that it isn&#x27;t

&gt; Frank--how was this recorded? I can&#x27;t comment on the images at all  
&gt; unless I understand how you&#x27;re getting them.

&gt;  Yeah, a woman with her face so close to the camera that the top of  
&gt; her head is cut off, and ya can almost see her nose hairs. Probably  
&gt; see that all the time on MTV.
