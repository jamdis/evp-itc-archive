<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m just sayin&#x27;--there are a very few that act like all is known and can
all be expelaned away. It&#x27;s those few that make comments back and forth,
between themselves implying that all this is foolishness, and they know so
much better. I don&#x27;t know why why, but that stuff really chaps my hide!

 I know for a fact that some of the voices out of the box, and other
methods are imagination, as they tend to change from day to as perceptions
shift. I have stuff form ten years ago that sound the same, and I aslo have
tapes from the first boxes that talk about what&#x27;s going on now. I have some
voice segments for m years ago that are also gibberish and noise.

 I don&#x27;t need some duffus telling me how I fool myself.

 F-S
