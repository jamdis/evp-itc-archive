&quot;Weird stuff out of the box, January 4th, flight 587 Ava New York, &quot;Bomb on
plane&quot; came out of a friends of mines box. He is from Michigan, said that he
researched it, there is an Ava New York, and they have flight 587 leaving
today. Just thought I would let you know.&quot;

 I think there was another with this date from the group.
