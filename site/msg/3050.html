<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I get other planets, Mars included. Our perceptions are pretty 
limited on this level. On the etheric level there&#x27;s no reason why all 
of the plantes can&#x27;t be inhabited, and it would be waste of real 
estate if they aren&#x27;t. 

 Maybe the level that contains Telsa and Edison have been opened?

&gt; Ann, this is a theory, maybe a crazy one and could be far off, but 
I&#x27;m going to throw it out there.
&gt;    
&gt;   I think that this may be in reference to the boxes.  (I think 
some of these messages that are delivered have to be looked at from a 
different angle).  Correct me if I am wrong (which I probably am) but 
don&#x27;t these different boxes use different frequencies for example (am 
vs fm).  Telsa was believe one worked better for long distances and 
just maybe that is the message in which is trying to be conveyed???  
That one may actually receive better transmission.  Telsa also 
believe that he could in fact contact Mars and Venus (which proved to 
be stars? (if I am correct).  In any event.  I think that you need to 
analyze the parties involved and apply them to which is actually 
going on now at this period of time.  
&gt;    
&gt;   I think that there are different plains and one may work better 
for say contacted the death, verses another for contacting 
differently life forms in the universe.
&gt;    
&gt;   I know you probably think I am so out there, but this was just a 
thought from an outsiders perspective.

&gt;           But what is going on now? Why all of a sudden is everyone 
hearing from Edison and Tesla? If these are the real men, what are 
they up to? Are they trying to divide and concur or are they working 
together?

&gt; I can tell you some of the real story of these two men (much 
abbreviated 
&gt; version).
&gt; 
&gt; Nikola Tesla worked for Edison for a while but they had a falling-
out 
&gt; because Tesla thought of improvements to Edison&#x27;s inventions that 
Edison, 
&gt; due to ego or whatever, didn&#x27;t think much of. Tesla also had a 
habit of 
&gt; ordering the most expensive chateaubriand at Edison&#x27;s expense when 
Edison 
&gt; took him out to dinner. They eventually parted ways.
&gt; 
&gt; Tesla happened upon George Westinghouse&#x27;s lab when Westinghouse 
needed 
&gt; repairs to a motor. Tesla went into the shop and machined such a 
&gt; high-quality repair that Westinghouse was immediately impressed. So 
Tesla 
&gt; ended up working for Westinghouse at that point.
&gt; 
&gt; Tesla had the idea of developing alternating-current systems for 
power 
&gt; distribution and Westinghouse backed it all the way. AC was much 
more 
&gt; efficient than Edison&#x27;s DC power distribution systems because it 
lacked 
&gt; the heat losses in the power lines that DC systems suffered from. 
Edison 
&gt; stood to lose much if his DC power systems were discarded in favor 
of AC 
&gt; power. So he invented the electric chair to demonstrate to the 
public 
&gt; just how dangerous AC was. The first attempt at using it on a death-
row 
&gt; inmate failed miserably; it didn&#x27;t kill him but amounted to torture 
&gt; instead.
&gt; 
&gt; Tesla went on to do his own research; much was funded by J. P. 
Morgan. 
&gt; That&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother story. But he and Westinghouse remained 
friends; 
&gt; he and Edison remained enemies.
&gt; 
&gt; Tesla was a very bad manager of money. He died in a hotel room in 
New 
&gt; York, with very little money at that time.
&gt; 
&gt; Another interesting anecdote - Tesla had taken to letting the 
pigeons into 
&gt; his hotel room, which the hotel owners didn&#x27;t enjoy but tolerated 
because 
&gt; of his notoriety. He had a favorite pigeon which sat on his phone. 
He had 
&gt; said several times that &quot;The day that my favorite pigeon dies, I 
will 
&gt; die.&quot; And so it happened.

&gt; &gt; Okay-- in your opinion--what is all this Tesla/Edison stuff 
about? It&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; getting as weird as as John Keel book around here.
