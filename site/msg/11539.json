I believe in aliens, spirit a=\r\nnd ghost communications via evp but tonight I had an experience I never had=\r\n before.\n\nI woke up at exactly 2:22 by my stove&#39;s clock and went and cleane=\r\nd my sink of dishes while I heated up some cream chipped beef (albiet not t=\r\noo exciting) but while I sat there after in the dark with my family sleepin=\r\ng my hallway ilummating a light clored blue several times. Anyone else ever=\r\n seen this?\n\nI look forward to any responses.\n\nThanks!\nAndrea \n \r\n------=_NextPart_000_0013_01C8E886.1FEBFC00\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.=\r\nw3c.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-eq=\r\nuiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META conte=\r\nnt=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6001.18063&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;BACKG=\r\nROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;H=\r\ni All,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I am Andrea Carr who is a 41 year old wife a=\r\nnd mom \nof 1 daughter.
