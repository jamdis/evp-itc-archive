{"id": "8913", "subject": "A few EVPMR files posted", "author": "Ron Lederer", "timestamp": "2008-04-04T19:19:07Z", "full_text": "--0-488115819-1207336747=:48803\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\nAfter redoing everything I was doing, and with a lot a help from the group, I think I actually hear a few things from my latest three minute evpmaker session.  I have posted in my files at Ronriko.  In one file I clearly hear the name R LEDERER.  It is unmistaken because most of my family can&#39;t even pronounce my last name correctly (but not the German pronunciation).    What is also interesting is the name came after I asked who is there to speak to me and before I asked them to say my name.  I do have at least two relatives on the other side with the same first initial as mine.  Interesting that they said R and not Ron.  This answer was heard a little more than half way into the file but I have posted more hoping someone hears more and can let me know.  That goes with the other files I have posted.  \n   \n  One other file posted, I hear ....I WILL SAVE....but I cannot make out what comes before or after.  Two other files have no messages but I am hoping someone will listen and comment.  \n  It&#39;s great to get something I can hear but I am certain I am missing tooooo much.  It&#39;s a start.   Thanks Bruce, Stefan and Margaret.   Ron L\n\n       \n---------------------------------\nYou rock.
