For instance, my father I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; certain would&#39;ve told me to move the trees I&#39;d planted over the septic tank,\n&gt; &gt; but would&#39;ve never said &quot;I love you.&quot; Maybe once he&#39;s dead, everything looks\n&gt; &gt; different to him? (That&#39;s providing I&#39;m really talking to dead people, which\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m starting to wonder about.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m also noticing a tendency for the names I&#39;m getting lately to be\n&gt; &gt; Biblical: Joseph and Michael have come through strongly, and I have no clue\n&gt; &gt; who they are. Maybe they make a name in order to talk to me?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve also been reading more about how there can be seemingly different\n&gt; &gt; groups of entities competing to talk:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://othersidecommunications.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=11\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I witnessed this, I think, myself when my uncle came through (giving\n&gt; &gt; supporting evidence that it truly was him) and I also heard someone say &quot;Get\n&gt; &gt; away from me.&quot; So maybe our dead relatives are indeed there, but other\n&gt; &gt; entities, wanting to hog the spotlight, get in the way or skew what our dead\n&gt; &gt; relatives say? Just a thought.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Frank Sumption\n&gt; &gt; &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I get those two.

The messages always seem to be the\n&gt; &gt; same,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though: &quot;I love you.&quot; Over and over, threading all through the\n&gt; &gt; recording,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both in the background, and more overtly when I ask a specific question\n&gt; &gt; such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as, &quot;Do you have a message for Heather?&quot; Does anyone else get this? I\n&gt; &gt; mean,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s flattering and all, but it doesn&#39;t really mean that much when I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know for sure who&#39;s telling me this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, &quot;they&quot; seem quite ready to tell me their first names, but\n&gt; &gt; almost\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never their last names. Why? Do last names cease to exist on the other\n&gt; &gt; side?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or is there some unwritten rule that says verifiable information can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; passed along? If so, who makes and enforces these rules?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if they can so easily say a name four times in a row (yesterday\n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was my friend&#39;s grandfather&#39;s name Donald), why can&#39;t they say one word\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me that would mean something? Or to my friend Heather? We both asked,\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got nothing, at least not that we could discern. It would seem a simple\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing to say the word plumber (that was my dad&#39;s secret word) or some\n&gt; &gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; single-syllable word. Now I&#39;m pretty sure I really did talk to my dad,\n&gt; &gt; as I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had another &quot;contact&quot; from him in my waking dream state the other\n&gt; &gt; morning,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but if it&#39;s really him, why can&#39;t he say something he would&#39;ve said in\n&gt; &gt; life?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why do I have the nagging feeling that &quot;they&quot; aren&#39;t human and never\n&gt; &gt; were?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just don&#39;t get it!
