There have the snake oil types, or\nrotten apples in the barrel, in most every field of work/research for\neons.  All we can hope for is minimal damage and maximum benefit.\n\nFor example, I didn&#39;t care, at all, for the negative slant the movie\nWhite Noise put on ITC.  But it did raise awareness of the subject and\nthe DVD had great bonus features on it showing people how to record\nfor EVP.  Overall, I&#39;d like to think it was a plus for the field.\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, psfponies &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sharon\n&gt; \n&gt; Regardless of the negative reactions that have been posted about\nMoon I am going to watch the show.
