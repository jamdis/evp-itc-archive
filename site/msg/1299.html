 Theres a long line of people who want one built for them, and a short line of those using the schematics to build it themselves. The boxes work much in the same way as the others. Frank still goes back and edits to see what he recorded. As with the sweep method often answers are "live" if you are asking the questions then start tuning for the reply. A few researchers are saying they are having good results using DC6 LIVE filtering software for real time communication. I havent tried it myself but I have heard a few of the results. Just keep trying thats all any of us can do. 
   
  For the sweep method I usually just tune until I hear my name spoken "live" or they will say "right here" when you are in the right tuning area. Recently Ive been trying the ST method first then continue on into the water method. For some reason the voices are very loud after the ST session ends and the radio is shut down. And a few say they prefer the water over the radio for speech. Others prefer the radio static. Not sure why exactly.

just another evp recording method and still needs to be edited and you 
don't have that real time communication.
I was disabled at 911 and have all the time in the world to experiment 
so I believe the box would be put to good use. can anyone steer me in 
the right direction as far as who to contact or how to have a box built?

all help is greatly appreciated.
