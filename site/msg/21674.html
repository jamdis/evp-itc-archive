<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Is anyone else noticing any similarities or correlations between the
names of the technicians on some of the boxes/radios we all use and the
names of prophets, saints, angels, or apostles in Christianity (and some
other religions)? I now know three people with a technician named
&quot;David,&quot; one with one named &quot;Thomas&quot; or &quot;Tom&quot; and I&#x27;ve been hearing the
name &quot;Tom&quot; and &quot;Thomas&quot; and &quot;Stephen.&quot; On another device I use, kind of
like an ovilus, I get &quot;Michael&quot; and &quot;John.&quot; Now, my dad&#x27;s name is Tom
and my bother&#x27;s name is Stephen, so it does seem kind of obvious that
these are names of other people as well, like those who have lived
before and are living now. However, it&#x27;s too coincidental  for me to
ignore that these are very specific names of prophets, holy men, angels,
and apostles, as well.

Has anyone else ever had any theories on this?</pre>
