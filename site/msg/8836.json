I don&#39;t think &#39;air&#39; means soundwaves in this case.  And I&#39;m in agreement with \n&gt; you, that I don&#39;t think sound is the key in the technique (though I suspect it to be with \nthe \n&gt; Portuguese crowd babble background and Voice 2000s DA300 recorder combo.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m going to try to get more specific answers about what exactly &#39;air&#39; is from Arthur&#39;s \n&gt; perspective.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Margaret,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; could &#39;air&#39; perhaps mean &#39;sound waves&#39;?

I hear most the content in your clips as you are.  On this one, I believe it \n&gt; says, &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will get us AIR speech.&quot;  I have repeatedly been told with this method that &#39;air&#39; has \n&gt; &gt; &gt; something to do with the communication.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure what Arthur&#39;s definition of &#39;air&#39; is, but it is definitely key to what is taking \n&gt; place.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He&#39;s used terms and phrases like &quot;Air-to-air&quot; - &quot;Air Ports&quot; - &quot;Air Portals&quot; - &quot;Helps \nyou \n&gt; &gt; &gt; enter our air&quot; - &quot;They&#39;ll give you air to us&quot; - &quot;I have air&quot; etc.  MANY references.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
