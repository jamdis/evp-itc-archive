I&#39;m having a great \ntime with this program, it&#39;s quite amazing actually.  You and Frank \nare definitely on to something with these methods, so what&#39;s next?  \nIs there an EVP Maker part 2 in the works with echo?\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Steve,\n&gt; \n&gt; I listened to your files and was able to hear most of them. Just one\n&gt; comment: In the file &quot;yes--to_help_you.mp3&quot;, after your \nquestion &quot;Are\n&gt; you able to use EVPmaker throgh this&quot;, I can hear: &quot;Yes, I help ... \nI\n&gt; help you, check it out&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve personally never had succes until today with EvpMaker.  It \nseems \n&gt; &gt; like they&#39;re talking loud and clear with that audio clip Stefan \n&gt; &gt; posted.  I am going to do another couple minute session later and \nsee \n&gt; &gt; what i get, the answers i feel are pretty clear.  But, i would \nlike to \n&gt; &gt; know if others are hearing them.  I suggest for people to \nexperiment \n&gt; &gt; with this file through EvpMaker and see what you guys get.  I&#39;m \nexcited \n&gt; &gt; once again about the communication we are receiving.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanx Stefan,\n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
