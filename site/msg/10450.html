&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt;  Ralph here again. Seems every time I come back on to leave a 
message
&gt; there&#x27;s some bickering going on. I can&#x27;t leave you people for a 
minute 
&gt; without some hoopla going on LOL (just Kidding). Well how ya&#x27;ll 
doing ?
&gt; Fine I hope. I have been busy with my Paranormal Group and 
&gt; investigations and Gettysburg. I was in Gettysburg over this past 
&gt; weekend and got an EVP in the Triagular Field that said &quot; Never 
trust 
&gt; Abe Lincoln &quot; LOL must have been a Rebel soldier. I thought that 
was 
&gt; pretty cool. I also got a voice whispering &quot; Good Day &quot; while I was 
&gt; leaving the field. I haven&#x27;t had any time to do any box research 
but I 
&gt; just recieved a cool device created by Bill Chappel called the &quot; 
&gt; Paranormal Puck &quot; can&#x27;t wait to use it. It does real time voice 
&gt; communication with phonetic speech and texting on the computer from 
&gt; taking the surrounding ambient energies to create speech from the 
&gt; atmosphere through the Paranormal puck that has eight sensors that 
&gt; gathers the data and converts it to speech. I think that is an 
accurate
&gt; description of it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Hey does anyone know what happened to Mike Colleta ? I haven&#x27;t 
heard 
&gt; anything from him for awhile. He hasn&#x27;t updated his website and his 
&gt; Blogtalk radio show has not been on lately either. I haven&#x27;t seen 
any 
&gt; posts on here either. So what&#x27;s up with Mike I hope he&#x27;s alright ? 
Just
&gt; concerned I really liked his Blogtalk shows. 
&gt; 
&gt; Frank Sumption please don&#x27;t let all of this bickering bother you. 
Your 
&gt; a better person than that. Keep up what your doing. I look forward 
to 
&gt; hearing what you have to say about your work and appreciate it 
also. 
&gt; Ignor all the hoopla and just give us all your knowledge and 
thoughts 
&gt; on what you love to do best and that&#x27;s good enough for me and all 
&gt; others on here that think your the best at what you do. We support 
you.
&gt; I wish I was as one tenth as smart as you, I would be making all 
kinds 
&gt; of gadgets believe me. I&#x27;m just a high school drop out with a GD 
from 
&gt; the Military working in a Post office ( making some good money 
though 
&gt; better than some College Grads) glad to say. I do have a ton of 
Ghost 
&gt; Hunting gadgets also LOL. My group calls me &quot; Inspector Gadget &quot; 
LOL.
&gt; So Frank your the reason alot of us have joined this group. So 
don&#x27;t 
&gt; be upset if some of the people get caught up in their own selves. 
Most 
&gt; of us want you here probably all of us do. It&#x27;s your choice what 
you 
&gt; do. I can&#x27;t persuade you to stay. It won&#x27;t be the same if you 
leave, 
&gt; your knowledge and you will be missed. I know I&#x27;ll miss ya. Even 
&gt; though I am not here all the time I am in the background watching 
and 
&gt; reading all the posts. Enough of my meandering gibberish. You all 
take 
&gt; care and I &#x27;ll let you know how the &quot;Paranormal Puck&quot; works out. 
&gt; Thanks for putting up with my long post here. Take care all.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
