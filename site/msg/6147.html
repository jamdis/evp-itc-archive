Ann  I will be happy to ask.  This is actually the first (two) messages that I personally believe I heard so it will be a stretch for me, probably, to both ask a question and get a response.  Nice thought...someday, maybe...hopefully.  I will test it tomorrow at the same time of day and location outside...probably no rain though.  From Mexico   Ron L

  I do have someone close to me on the other side names Helen who I have been asking after. Perhaps you can ask if this Helen is for me.

  I am posting two short sessions for hopefully others to comment on.  This is completed with a RS 469 going directly into my handheld digital recorder.  Coincidentally, I am outside in a light rain so maybe it is ideal for me here in Mexico where I get few signals.
  At first I thought I heard the word BUENO (hello in Spanish) but I now hear DINO with is my wife's name...short for Dinorah.  She is normally not with me for sessions and was not with me for this session so I doubt what I am hearing.  Any comments would be appreciated.  
  The other recording I hear the name HELEN.  I don't know anyone with that name.  Ron L
