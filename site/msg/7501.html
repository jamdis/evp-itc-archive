&gt; Thanks Misty.

&gt;   Would you by chance have the You Tube site where that is for the 
12-470?

&gt;   Mike posted some videos on his website for both hacks the 12-469 
and the 12-470. They are also on youtube. For the 470 its pretty much 
just snipping the wire that goes to the mute instead of removing a 
pin in the 469.
&gt;    
&gt;   People say they have good results with the 470 because the 469 
has a clicking noise.

&gt;       Hello all !!
&gt; I have been lurking on the board for awhile, feeling not much to 
&gt; contribute.
&gt; I am interested in this connection and communication (Thanks to 
&gt; Debbie !!)
&gt; I&#x27;ve observed a few things on the board. Somehow this word &quot;purple&quot; 
&gt; keeps popping up and I can&#x27;t help but to think of the color purple 
in 
&gt; the spectrum. Does the color relate to some sort of sound wave 
&gt; also ? or correlates to something in the electronic field that your 
&gt; helpers from the other side are trying to propose ?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I have noticed that the Frank boxes do not seem to be 
&gt; distributed to many women (is this because women do not have good 
&gt; results with the other side ?)
&gt; I know Debbie has done a lot of successful work, but, does this 
mean 
&gt; that women have a more difficult time with communication ?
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t have a box and I don&#x27;t know how to build one !! I went to 
&gt; radio shack and whatever was recommended is replaced with the new 
470.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t know where to begin except that Frank recommended starting 
&gt; with EVPMAKER. I&#x27;d like to build something of my own and don&#x27;t know 
&gt; where to start with a receiver/scanner of my own.
&gt; I&#x27;d be so happy if someone could share some technology with me !!!??
&gt; thanks, Holly
