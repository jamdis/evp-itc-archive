  I just got my paranormal puck a couple of days ago and in regular people terms, it takes readings from the environment:  EMF (man-made and natural), voltage, frequency, and temperature, and translate those readings into words from a 2,000 word dictionary.  It also logs all the readings on a spreadsheet.  You can also set alarms and threshholds for spikes, and well as incorporate a PC camera or audio device to record pictures, video or audio whenever your alarms are reached.  It's a very interesting device.  One of the first questions I asked it was "Who are you?"  It answered "Edison, reincarnation".   I brought it to a meeting today of the group I belong to, the San Francisco Ghost Society, and when our resident psychic asked it "What's my name?"  It replied with the word "Medium".  Like I said, it's a very interesting device, indeed!  The inventor refers to the device not as an ITC device, but rather, a ECM device -- for Environmental Communications Mode, as it is
 driven purely from environmental data alone.
