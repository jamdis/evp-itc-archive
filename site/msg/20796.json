Please?", "author": "Rheta", "timestamp": "2011-02-21T02:20:58Z", "full_text": "Hi everyone,\n\n  I hope I am not repeating something that has already been addressed about the 12-587 hack but I have a problem with the radio stations still coming through (AM) although the radio is sweeping at a very fast pace according to the display.  I only cut the pin; not removed it completely.  Could that be the problem?  Has anyone else had that problem and can anyone offer a solution?  Thanks ahead of time.\n\n                       Rheta"}
