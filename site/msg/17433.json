They are Dr. Pamela Rae Heath and Dr. Jon\nKlimo. =\r\n(Frank don&#39;t even THINK of hitting the Reply button quite yet.) In this boo=\r\nk,\nthey have distilled hundreds of channeled messages from many centuries i=\r\nn an\nattempt to present a comprehensive mixture of what these message might=\r\n tell\nus about the nature of death and the afterlife. Heath and Klimo clear=\r\nly state that \nthis book is not for everyone. It is for those who find the =\r\ntopic interesting and \nwonder what has been learned from such=A0 communicat=\r\nions. Clearly those who \ndoubt such communications are possible or who disb=\r\nelieve in the concept of \nafterlife probably will have no use for this book=\r\n.\n\nHere are two well-known scientists (in the Parapsychology community) who=\r\n\nacknoweldge that sometimes it is more important to suggest what might be\np=\r\nossible than to stand only on that which is empirically proveable. The very=\r\n\nnature of science is to explain where possible and to recognize that quite=\r\n\noften the right answer to many questions is &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;\n\nDr. Julie Bei=\r\nschel and Dr. Gary Schwartz have conducted extensive research\ninto mediumsh=\r\nip. What that research has demonstrated is that there are \npeople who can k=\r\nnow things they should not with no known ways of this \nhappening. This is c=\r\nalled &#39;anomalous information reception&#39; in Parapsychology.\nThe point is tha=\r\nt we know this anomalous ability exists. What we do not \nknow, from the Sci=\r\nence, is whether discarnate entities are communicating.\nCertainly the resea=\r\nrch mediums involved believe so, such is the nature of\ntheir compelling exp=\r\neriences. But the Science cannot, to date, support\nthe claim. And that is w=\r\nhat is critical to understand here.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to r=\r\necognize that using technology does\nnot necessarily imply the Scientific Me=\r\nthod nor does is mean one is doing \nScience. What it does mean is that a pa=\r\nrt of the experience is documented\nand that might be useful at some future =\r\ntime when Science does have the \ntools and understanding to further evaluat=\r\ne the documents. Today this is, \nunfortunately, simply not true.\n\nWhat is k=\r\nnown is that people are recording audio and video and believe \nthey have ca=\r\nptured anomalies. Many people think these represent voices\nof spirits and l=\r\noved ones. Unfortuantely the pure truth is that Science is \nsimply not in a=\r\n position to validate this at this time. But that does not \nmean anyone sho=\r\nuld stop, nor that anyone should feel they have no reason\nto guess what mig=\r\nht be going on, or to speculate about the phenomena.\n\nIt also means that cy=\r\nnics and skeptics who demand proof are going to\nhave a hard time finding it=\r\n. If Science is not yet able to describe what it\nis that is going on, skept=\r\nics and cynics have no way to determine what \nis absolute proof. They can h=\r\nowever choose to accept some personal \nvariant of their own truth as accept=\r\nable proof should they so desire.\nBut this is not empirical proof as requir=\r\ned by Science.\n\nDr. Donald Hoffman is an expert on visual perception and is=\r\n one of \nthe authors of &quot;Conscious Realism&quot; - a scientific theory of realit=\r\ny\nwhich is the first to solve the mind/body problem. Dr. Hoffman is one\nsci=\r\nentist who completely understands how people misperceive things,\nand yet hi=\r\ns controversial theories challenge even some of the world&#39;s \nleading theore=\r\ntical physicists when it comes to understanding. Clearly\nthere are scientis=\r\nts who appreciate this phenomena may well be real.\nI have personal dialogs =\r\nwith them frequently. You would simply not\nbelieve how frustrating it is fo=\r\nr someone whose job it is to explain \nthe world to others to have no idea w=\r\nhatsoever what might be going\non here.\n\nI hope this helps put a face on Sci=\r\nence, and that I have succintly\nbut=A0 clearly explained why Science offers=\r\n no magic explanations\nat this time. And at the same time, perhaps this wil=\r\nl better set\nexpectations for everyone while recognizing that the work bein=\r\ng \ndone here may well have potential merit in the due course of time.\n\n\n   =\r\n   \r\n--0-1361779724-1275496424=:13770\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1=\r\n0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;I would like to try to address some of the themes that have been =\r\ngoing back and &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;forth in this forum of late; specifically, the s=\r\ntate of science and the real explanatory&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;power,&nbsp; or lack th=\r\nereof, it truly has.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Two highly respected para=\r\npsychologists recently published an interesting book&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;called &quot;Han=\r\ndbook to the Afterlife&quot;.
