Could they be talking about the \n&gt;Christopher who uses one of your boxes?\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Our Chris.....Is giving a reception&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Dave\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; WOW!! I am amazed that someonme actually tried this! It does work.\n&gt;There was\n&gt; &gt; a Danish(I think) researcher doing the same thing, but never could\n&gt;make\n&gt; &gt; contact with them. I have done this myself, and it can work wiht TV\n&gt;too, if\n&gt; &gt; you can switch channels fast ennough. I think you could use a\n&gt;steeper motor\n&gt; &gt; controler to randomly turn a stepper moter, to turn the dial.\n&gt;Manually\n&gt; &gt; spinning the dial has one advantage, the sound is clearer! I have\n&gt;yet to see\n&gt; &gt; a method of ITC that produces better results that the random tuning\n&gt;methods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Sweep Tuning of AM Radio Band\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 19 Mar 2007 17:19:47 -0700\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning\n&gt;system. I tried\n&gt; &gt; &gt;several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner through the\n&gt;AM band\n&gt; &gt; &gt;late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the dial moving at a\n&gt;constant\n&gt; &gt; &gt;rate of speed. This is not nearly as good as Frank&#39;s &#39;hands off&#39;\n&gt;random\n&gt; &gt; &gt;tuning method but it still produced some results. What impressed\n&gt;me most is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that some of the voices sound the same, even though I tuned\n&gt;through several\n&gt; &gt; &gt;channels. This attached capture could be a technical message.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Plug a million hertz&quot; One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which\n&gt;is close\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Dave\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;       Recent Activity\n&gt;\n&gt;       6\n&gt;   New Members\n&gt;\n&gt;       4\n&gt;   New Photos\n&gt;\n&gt;       5\n&gt;   New Links\n&gt;\n&gt;Visit Your Group\n&gt;   SPONSORED LINKS\n&gt;\n&gt;    Ghost writer\n&gt;    Ghost writer book\n&gt;    Ghost writer services\n&gt;    Ghost writer services\n&gt;    Ghost stories\n&gt;\n&gt;       Top Scientist\n&gt;   10 Greatest Ever\n&gt;   Share and vote\n&gt;   on Bix.com!\n&gt;\n&gt;     Yahoo!
