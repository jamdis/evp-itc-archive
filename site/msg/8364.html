<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce,

&gt; I never had much use for EVP maker but that I guess is because no one
&gt; has found the right combination of file and program until now.

Well, I wouldn&#x27;t say that. There are people out there which did have
success with this method (including me). I got one of my favorite EVPs
with EVPmaker. (It was in German, so I can&#x27;t present it here.) But
you&#x27;re right, the source file is very essential.

&gt; I raised the volume on the responses because My questions Tend to be a
&gt; bit loud and I do not like for the listener to go from one level to
&gt; another so abruptly, I also tend to do this with my box files.

BTW, there&#x27;s a cool function in Audition / Cool Edit, called &quot;Dynamic
Range Processing&quot;. A quote from the Help file: &quot;The dynamics processor
varies the output level of a waveform, based on its input level. This
lets you limit or compress the dynamic range of a sample so that the
perceived loudness is kept below a defined limit, or so that the
waveformï¿œs overall dynamic range is kept at roughly the same level.&quot;

There are some useful presets, e.g. &quot;limit soft -18 dB w/boost&quot; which
limits the level to -18 dB and then amplifies the signal, resulting in a
waveform with an overall equal volume.
