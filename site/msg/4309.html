<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes he does!  If he didn&#x27;t post his 12-469 hack I would have never 
become curious about the 12-470, and figured out that hack.
I remember asking the group, since the 12-470 looked similar, could 
it be hacked too?  Sum came back and said, &quot;$39.95 and you can find 
out, Mike&quot;.  So I went and paid the $39.95, opened it up... and the 
rest is history... :-)

I think Sum is doing okay... I have a feeling we will be hearing from 
him very soon..

&gt; LOL they look neat. Wonder where Sum went tho, it said he unjoined 
our group. Hope everything is well for him he deserves a big thanks 
for coming up with the idea and getting you guys started. Hopefully 
when he can he will return.

new labels

is 
&gt; very appropriate... dont&#x27;t you?
