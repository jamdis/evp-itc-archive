The FM sweep tops out at about 10.5\nvolts, while the AM is 7.5 volts. So either I have to lose part of the FM\nband, and only sweep to 7.5 volts, have dead air in parts of AM, or do some\nlevel switching. I&#39;m running two sweep modes, random and linear, 4 sweep\nlevels, Random AM and FM, and Linear AM and FM. So I have to incorporate the\nsweep mode and band switch together. A 4 pole double throw rotary switch for\nband and a SPDT switch from sweep mode. Plus a SPDT switch for speaker\nmode==echo chamber or direct. Then power is DPDT switch, which is part of\nthe tone control.\n\n It&#39;s kinda fun to think this crap up.\n\n F-S\n\nSome imes hey can be complica ed.
