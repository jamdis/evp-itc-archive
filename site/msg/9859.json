In the SJ\nmanual http://www.speechchips.com/downloads/speakjetusermanual.pdf there\nis a table of all allophones with pronunciation examples.\n\nThe &#39;Play List&#39; of Audition/Cool Edit could be used to create sequences\nof cues/allophones, to synthesize the words/sentences for the training.\n\nI&#39;ve uploaded some files to my folder\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Stefan/Speech%20Recognition%20Training/\nto show the process. Of course, it would be a rather laborious procedure\nto synthesize all the sentences necessary for the training, but, well,\nthat&#39;s the way science is! ;-)\n\nMy example of the synthesized sentence &quot;Hello, good morning&quot; might not\nbe the correct pronunciation, but I&#39;m sure you as native English\nspeakers can do it much better than me. :)\n\n(BTW, many EVP examples sound much more clear and fluent than my above\nexample...)\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if that would work. I remember back in the day, which was\n&gt; a Wednesday by the way (lol), you used to have to train the program to\n&gt; recognize your speech. I don&#39;t know if that has changed since then.\n\n&gt; -Aaron\n\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Michael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Has anyone on this site purchased voice to print software to use for\n&gt; the allophone program? \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt; http://www.digitalriver.com/v2.0-img/operations/scansoft/site/367062/367062_dns-talk.html\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Michael Edwards:  f1cracker75@..."}
