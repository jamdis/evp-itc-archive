  Example Question: How are you today?  
   
  1st Answer:(Cut Up) I'm good, me and my spirts friends here wants to give you a long message for the reseachers to here>  
   
  2nd Answer:(Not Cut) I'm blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah good blah blah.

  Does anybody see my point on cut up messages?

      Stefan,
 
I do remove the "garbage" from my files.
 
At this point in my research, the message is more important to me than the proof of it.
I think most of us here will agree that we are receiving some sort of paranormal communication.
but it definitely exists. now we need to concentrate on the messages they need us to hear and the answers to the questions
we ask and in turn our answers to their questions. Anyone that cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the file
that has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously garbage like the "EH O EH AH O EH UR" in between words.
 
For example "Is there anyone here that wishes to communicate_YES_AH ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE"
It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return to a file that I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold some
relivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds.
 
At this stage in real time communication the messages are the top priority.
I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained and made available to individuals that make a request 
for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may be made, and god knows there are always fanatical 
sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to attack an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that 
our research files should be made available on request by every tom dick and harry that is unknown to us and may potentially
doctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such.
 
I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the researcher that receives the request for raw research data should 
scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment before handing out any research data.
 
These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file.
 
Bruce

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP

      Hi all,

just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I would
suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, in
order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can for
instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including
the experimenter's voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, but
not cut out individual pieces (supposed "garbage") to make an EVP match
with what it "should be". At least, the unedited version should always
be provided along with the edited version.

But that's only my personal opinion which I thought I had to express, as
we should always be able to present our results to a critical public.

Stefan
