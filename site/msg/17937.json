I was really new to this but, from the first day she\n&gt; came up missing, and the police thought she would be found ok, I did a\n&gt; session on that first day, and I posted what I got on a couple of lists.  I\n&gt; still have those files, and date on them on the pc here, I played them to\n&gt; police over the phone, and they took the report, in the end every thing\n&gt; spirit said was true.  Everything, right down to the place they found her\n&gt; body, I think Bruce might recall this, it was his list I think where they\n&gt; were posted, everyone was hoping she&#39;d be ok, but as it turns out she was\n&gt; killed, spirit said, &quot;code blue&quot;, gave his occupation, &quot;the tech&quot; and his\n&gt; full name &quot;Raymond Clark&quot; and hers &quot;Annie Le&quot; they said &quot;he buried her body\n&gt; in the wall&quot; and that her body would be found.  The girl herself even came\n&gt; through crying, and had an older Chinese woman (the accent) I can locate\n&gt; these files, if you like I will post them again.  I know this stuff is true,\n&gt; I let the police hear the files over the phone when they were taking\n&gt; reports, the files were clear enough, that the guy heard them, he thought it\n&gt; was people in a bar talking about the what happened, sf\n&gt;\n&gt;  In a message dated 7/9/2010 10:33:40 P.M.

Not only do you not control\n&gt;&gt;&gt; what the &#39;spirits&#39; say, you also don&#39;t control what broadcast radio says,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and to a large extent you don&#39;t control what your brain finds and interprets\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in the noise you are hearing.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I listened to these (trying not to look at the labels, since once a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; person looks at the labels, they prime their brains to interpret the sounds\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in YOUR way, not their own way).  To me, they were either just a mess of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; random radio snippets, exactly what you&#39;d expect if a 3 year old were\n&gt;&gt;&gt; randomly twisting the radio dial, or they were just noise.  Nothing\n&gt;&gt;&gt; paranormal in the least.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I think your instinct to stop posting this stuff might have been a good\n&gt;&gt;&gt; one.

See how you\n&gt;&gt;&gt; feel being away from all this for a while.  Come back fresh if you feel ok\n&gt;&gt;&gt; after that.  But if you feel obsessed when away, it might be good to ask\n&gt;&gt;&gt; your friends and loved ones for some opinions on what they see in you.  Your\n&gt;&gt;&gt; health is more important than anything here anyways, and you can&#39;t really do\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a job with interpretation of your results, much less your other\n&gt;&gt;&gt; responsibilities in life, unless you put your health first.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- On *Fri, 7/9/10, SnowfireL@aol. com&lt;http://mc/compose?to=SnowfireL@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;SnowfireL@aol. com &lt;http://mc/compose?to=SnowfireL@...&gt;&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: SnowfireL@aol. com &lt;http://mc/compose?to=SnowfireL@aol.com&gt; &lt;SnowfireL@aol.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; com &lt;http://mc/compose?to=SnowfireL@...&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Last nights files, [13 Attachments]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: inside_the_box_ rtsc_ghost_ box_research@ yahoogroups. com&lt;http://mc/compose?to=inside_the_box_rtsc_ghost_box_research@yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com &lt;http://mc/compose?to=EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; RTSC@yahoogroups. com &lt;http://mc/compose?to=RTSC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Friday, July 9, 2010, 7:26 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; *Well, got no response out of the other list, let&#39;s see if any of you\n&gt;&gt;&gt; folks on these lists can hear these at all. They may be too fast, but I did\n&gt;&gt;&gt; try to slow them a bit,  I know, these are very hard to hear, got them last\n&gt;&gt;&gt; night in response to Steve&#39;s letter about all the &quot;religious&quot;  crap I&#39;ve\n&gt;&gt;&gt; been sending,  such weird files I sometimes send in lately.  I do not\n&gt;&gt;&gt; control what spirits say though, after all they are just people too.  Got\n&gt;&gt;&gt; one on here that&#39;s really funny, I think it has a little demon on it too, he\n&gt;&gt;&gt; seems very angry, and wants someone to &quot;Let me out!  Let me out!&quot; is what he\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is saying, I think he is wanting to come after some folks, because, even\n&gt;&gt;&gt; demon&#39;s believe in God.  He really sounds mad at some people and wants\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;.....out,&quot; just going to let you hear it, may need to play it several times\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to hear, but I think its kinda cute. I told them what some on the lists\n&gt;&gt;&gt; were saying, and this was the response.  btw  Is someone going to Florida ?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The last one says something about FL Hope you all enjoy them. sf*\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;\n\nYeah, i 's ha s u ha p o es EVP, excep o he skep ic, hey accep no e idence wha soe e .
