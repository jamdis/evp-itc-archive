   I have my own �group� on the other side, or on the etheric levels, that claim I�m one of theirs, that�s why I get this stuff. 
  
   I have no fear of death, I�ve even gone to where some of these voices said I was supposed to have a heart attack, and just stood there thinking how interesting it was, and mentally telling them �brave enough for ya�. It�s a line from the movie �Defending Your Life�. 
  
   I doubt if they are talking about somewhere else, but they may have their times all mixed. I think when events, like asteroid impacts happen, it creates time ripples, and we pick these up in our voices. The closer we get to the event, the stronger the voices, and ripples get.

          ok heres a stupid question frank

    are these the kind of things that you want to know from "them"? are they just telling you? AND if they upset you why dont you tell them to stop? I personally would NOT like them telling me this type of information, true or untrue, i lean toward the OCD side, <obsessive compulsive disorder> my mom has it severe and somethings i have it bad too.................like about death, and i get feelings about not driving a certain route to somewhere etc so this kind of stuff makes my brain hurt lol

    just wondering why you do evp and how it evolved to getting "PRIVILAGED" information from them?  Do you wonder if theyre talking about somewhere other than HERE? maybe in thier realm or things that have already happened?

    

    curosity kills me lol
