<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these files.  
After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that 
section down about 20%.  Now i can actually start to hear the message 
a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise that 
don&#x27;t belong and eliminate them from the mix.  You can&#x27;t piece these 
files together to make something it&#x27;s not, so i keep them in true 
form pretty much to the original.

file?  Did you need to take out a lot of garbage between words 
withing the message?   Ron L

few passes.  BUT the first pass I also hear BETTER THAN EARTH.  
Amazing what the mind, or something, can do.  Ron L
