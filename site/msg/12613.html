<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Allen,

I used some items I had laying around my basement.
The noise generation item is my ole favorite, the &#x27;My Lil Reminder&#x27; 
20 second digital recorder/player. The same one I use in the Mike&#x27;s 
Box. I had a couple extras so I used it after recording some white 
noise to its chip.
The microphone was one from a wear-on-the-head boom microphone.  I 
took it apart and attached it inside the black box.
I then placed some cotton over the top of it to help filter out the 
louder audio of the white noise.
The box has a small hole in it cover with a rubber piece, so a bit of 
audio can come through from outside and be capture by the mic.

With the 8 foot cable, I can add and extension to that in case you 
want to lower it into a well or something like that.  The box will 
keep the microphone shelterd in a damp environment.

Yes, I&#x27;ll be sure to stop by and meet you and April.  That would be 
great!
I&#x27;m waiting for Bill Murphy of the Darkness radio guys to contact me 
with the specifics on me coming to the Stanley.  They wanted me to 
talk and give the attendees a briefing on my prototype stuff, which I 
would love to do.
I go around from coast to coast giving briefings to people anyway for 
my job, so I very much enjoy talking to crowds and find it very easy 
to do.
This would be my first paranormal group talk though.

Have a great day!
- Mike Coletta

&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; I like the microphone.  What did you use if you don&#x27;t mind giving
&gt; specifics?  
&gt; 
&gt; April and I will be at the Stanley also.  We will be selling TAPS
&gt; merchandise and magazines.  Stop by if you get a chance.  We would
&gt; like to meet you.

&gt; &gt; Another UFO Geek paranormal tip. White Noise - Black Box 
Microphone for
&gt; &gt; EVP recording &amp; more. This prototype has an 8 foot cord for 
recording
&gt; &gt; with regular tape recorders, digital recorders, or on the 
computer. 
&gt; &gt; Good for recording EVPs, ghost box sessions, and other paranormal 
type
&gt; &gt; activities.
