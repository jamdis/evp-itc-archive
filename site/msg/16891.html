You say the 'bitch' comes out when you feel you're being spoken down to, ye=
t you start threads on you own (like this one) where you attack those who h=
old different opinions than yours, but who have said nothing against you.=
=C2=A0 Skeptic simply means not believing things just because someone claim=
s it.=C2=A0 Anyone on the internet who is NOT a skeptic is in danger of los=
ing a lot of money to Nigerian bankers.

No testing I've ever seen, whether=
 my own or from others, has shown me results that could be shown to only ha=
ve come from some paranormal entities.=C2=A0 That is, while one could claim=
 it did, there was nothing about it that also couldn't be explained as comi=
ng from just the misinterpretation of noise, or of random radio broadcast s=
nippets.=C2=A0 And so I see no reason to explain the results by claiming th=
ey come from ghosts or aliens when a more mundane explanation works just as=
 well.=C2=A0 Well one reason maybe: its more fun to believe.

Many people w=
ho claim a more exotic explanation also, curiously, claim it can't be teste=
d or verified.=C2=A0 While those who claim it is based on personal interpre=
tation of noise and random broadcast, can and do test that theory just fine=
.=C2=A0 Again, this could be explained by some incredibly complex system of=
 ghost-rules where ghosts aren't allowed to communicate in good grammar, an=
d are required to make only bad predictions or spew irrelevant comments, or=
 must perform poorly only when being tested.=C2=A0 Or it could be explained=
 simply by accepting that the tests are good, and that it is the claims bei=
ng=C2=A0 tested that are bogus.=C2=A0=C2=A0 I think it takes a lot of danci=
ng to believe the former over the latter.

Again, being skeptical means not=
 simply accepting=C2=A0 claims, especially unusual ones, without some criti=
cal thinking and investigation.=C2=A0 It doesn't mean that the claims deser=
ve to be rejected outright, just as it doesn't mean rejecting everything we=
 know about history and science.=C2=A0 There is nothing wrong with demandin=
g evidence of unusual claims.=C2=A0 But not just evidence: good evidence, e=
vidence gathered under controlled conditions.=C2=A0 Personal claims about g=
hosts are not good evidence.=C2=A0 Recordings that can only be understood o=
nce someone is first told what they are supposed to hear, is not good evide=
nce.=C2=A0 The only good evidence we have are the claims where the recordin=
gs are said to predict something: and then that something doesn't happen.=
=C2=A0 Unfortunately, that is good evidence that this is just random sounds=
, not that their is any intelligence lying to us.

Notice also, that if I a=
m a skeptic, I do not need to call those who are not skeptical, or are conv=
inced that their are ghosts on their radio, names or other insulting things=
.=C2=A0 I do not feel the need to be defensive, because I have nothing to d=
efend.=C2=A0 I just ask for, look for, and wait for, better evidence.=C2=A0=
 Nothing would make me happier to find proof of an afterlife, beyond just c=
laims and televangelists and shows on tv.=C2=A0 That's why I comment about =
claims of proof that I don't think hold water. Because I think real proof i=
s important.=C2=A0 And bogus proof is the primary obstacle to finding the g=
ood stuff.
