<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>On the Queen Mary this week, the Darkness Radio event organizers asked
that I provide a couple of 12-469&#x27;s for their charity auction. The two
Shack Hack&#x27;s sold for a combined $260. Darkness Radio raised over
$17,000 on this event that was donated to a Los Angeles battered
woman&#x27;s shelter. The organizers have raised a healthy six figures for
various charities around the country. It&#x27;s always with representatives
from the recipient organization present and the checks and cash is
publicly counted and turned over to the representatives. 

The people that attend these events are always eager to learn about FB
and the other Boxes. The difference between this event and other
public demonstrations of the Box is that no one at the Darkness
event&#x27;s wants to personally profit from ITC. I explained how to hack
the 469&#x27;s and the folks who bought them during the auction knew these
were originally $24 radios but choose to help the auction while
getting a Shack Hack. Later on both nights a group gathered to
exchange ideas and listen and try to interpret for themselves what was
coming out of the Boxes.
