&gt; I don&#x27;t think it all means nothing, but some of it does.  They want 
&gt; to see how far they can push us until we give up.  Not all have 
good

and 
&gt; bad, but we learn to deal with both.

&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know, the fact that no one hears the same is frustrating. 
&gt; What if it all means nothing!?

&gt; &gt; Ok, than i hear it like you do. Isn&#x27;t the idea of posting files 
to 
&gt; get different theories on what is heard? What are we comprehending 
&gt; in these or any other files anyway? We are just starting to break 
&gt; ground on full sentence answers, so we need to sift through them 
and 
&gt; make sense. That one about the earthquake is a great file, but what 
&gt; does it mean??? It doesn&#x27;t make any sense, we have to make sense of 
&gt; these files. Whether it be in reverse, enhancing the audio or 
&gt; whatever. This is our job as researchers, while they laugh their 
ass 
&gt; off on the other side watching us spend hours on the computer to 
say 
&gt; there is going to be an earthquake somewhere that doesn&#x27;t happen. 
If 
&gt; they say &#x27;Steve likes cupcakes in a tree in east asia&#x27;, that&#x27;s a 
&gt; great file and it will be clear. But what would it mean and what 
&gt; effect will it have on humanity.Nuff Said&#x27;-Steve H.--- In EVP-

&gt; That&#x27;s the problem, get something that is not in human awareness to 
&gt; be recognized, heard, and comprehended. It&#x27;s almost impossible. &gt; &gt;
