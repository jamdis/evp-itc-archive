Hi Bill,
  Good to see you here!  Enjoyed our lunch together and the conference.  Some of those presentations were excellent, weren't they?  did you get a luminator picture with Mark Macy?  If so, did you get anything in it?  Take care, Vicki

  Vicki, it's been nice reading your post. I am still absorbing all the presentations including yours I heard at the AA-EVP Conference in Atlanta. I was your lunch time pal, Bill Murphy.
