The wind would blow a light piece of material around in the cylinder that would change the capacitance seen by the antenna. I was thinking you could probably hook the thing to an old non-electronically tuned radio directly across the tuning capacitor or in place of it. At least thats what I would try first. It may need some sort of amplification and or filtering, don&#39;t know, just a hack electrician here. \n&gt;      It would be nice if the light piece of material was a ball of hair from a loved one but i would guess that a piece or more of aluminized mylar would probably work better. And the  antenna should be offset to the side so the hairball could go up and down out of the field to choose whatever station the &quot;others&quot; would like.\n&gt;  \n&gt;          Heres a drawing:\n&gt;      http://www.flickr.com/photos/johniestring/\n&gt;"}
