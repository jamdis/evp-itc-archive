<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m on the south side, in Littleton, yeah the 1st would be the best, since 
it&#x27;s a Sunday. I still have a regular work schedule.

Chris Moon is going to be presenting the box on Coast to Coast in March(1st 
?).  I  kinda dread it, cuz the work load, and demand may take off, along 
with any privacy, and spare time I might have had, especailly since I&#x27;m 
still not prepared to mass produce this stuff.

&gt;Hey Frank, are you close to Denver? As mentioned, I&#x27;ll be arriving on the 
&gt;28th of March, and will return to pick up someone at the airport on the 1st 
&gt;of April, then I&#x27;ll come off Estes Park on the 5th. Any of those days will 
&gt;work if it works for you. The 1st of April is particularly good if you&#x27;re 
&gt;fine with that. I really look forward to meeting you.

&gt;
&gt;This is how I make the &quot;echo box&quot;. The frame is 1/4 inch poplar from Lowes,
&gt;the foil in the heavy duty aluminum foil, and it is glued on with contact
&gt;cement. You can see the mic and speaker mounted opposite each other on wood
&gt;sides. The sides are 1/8&quot; plywood expoxied into the frame. It gives a solid
&gt;mounting panel for the mic and speaker, and can be card board, as well. I
&gt;try to avoid plasitc, as it seems to be &quot;contra-ghost voice&quot; if that makes
&gt;any sense.
