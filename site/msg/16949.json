My  \n&gt; question was simple and to the point &quot;Is it the board or the radio that&#39;s  causing \n&gt; the problem?&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; The answer came seconds after asking it.  It was an intelligent  response \n&gt; to my question.  I would like for someone to comment of this with  the \n&gt; explanation of how they did that.  I just know they speak to me and i  don&#39;t know \n&gt; how they do it.  There is still so much to learn about this  field.\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Steve H."}
