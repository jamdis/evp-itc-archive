IT&#39;S A FREE \nPROGRAM !!! So it might be of use in this itc group research. I \nthought I should pass that along if anyone wants a great little \nproggie. If it&#39;s free it&#39;s for me LOL. Just do a Google on EVP \nAssitant then you should find it easily. You could record the tones to \na CD and use it that way or whatever. Well you all take care. Keep up \nthe great research.\n\nRegards,\n\nRalph the Ghost Hunter\nS.P.I.R.I.T. Paranormal Investigation Team of Central PA."}
