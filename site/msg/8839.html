<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Kristin.  I find that some of this is very similar to traditional EVP, where more than one 
thing can be heard fairly well in the same example.  It can really make things confusing!  

I often wonder why they can&#x27;t be more clear, more often, but then I have to laugh when I 
think about all the song lyrics that get slaughtered by people singing along with the tune 
and then just guessing at what the less clear parts say.  LOL.  :0)

Check out this fun site I ran across (Kiss This Guy:  The Archive of Misheard Lyrics):

&gt; Hi Kristin. I can hear all of these as you are. On the &quot;evil eye&quot; on I also
&gt; hear it as, &quot;You 
&gt; forget to be polite.&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully amongst us, we can come up with a little better explanation of
&gt; &#x27;air.&#x27;

&gt; &gt; I just posted three MP3 files in my folder (Kristin&#x27;s Folder)from a
&gt; &gt; session I did today using EVP Maker and the Allophones. Please listen
&gt; &gt; to see if you hear as I do. I find this way much tougher to hear
&gt; &gt; live... so I hope I am doign better! Please let me know. THX!

&gt; &gt; The first one actually coincides with Margaret&#x27;s.. ARTHUR EMPLOYS AIR
&gt; &gt; HOLES.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The second ones says: YOU ARE GETTING THE EVIL EYE
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Third one says: YOU ARE VALUABLE
