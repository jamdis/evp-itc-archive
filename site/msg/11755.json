I would keep things as simple as as you can,\nso either go straight into the recorder or record the speaker.  You\ncan certainly experiment, but I like to use the same set-up as much as\ni can and keep it as portable as possible since we experiment at\ndifferent locations.  \n\nAllen Slaughter\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chad&quot; &lt;cawiggins78@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you guys think I need to run the 469 and the mic into a mixer, then\n&gt; run the mixer into the Olympus. Do you think that would work? If so,\n&gt; any suggestions as to a good mixer to use?\n&gt;"}
