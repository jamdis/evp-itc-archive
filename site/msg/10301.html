<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Ann. I think going to more compacted files will help us all in 
the long run. We are already back to 72% rather than 96% tho most of 
the file space was being used by someone else besides you =)

I know it gets to be a bit testy around here and the other forums. I 
also know that some of the nastiness can tear apart good working 
relationships as well as friendships. I was just askin Frank if he 
knew if you were still sick or not because you had been very quiet 
lately.

I agree sometimes its good to take a step back rather than get 
yourself caught up in the drama fests going on around us all. Thats 
on and off the board as well. 

As I said I know some of what goes on off of this forum, and I am sad 
to see most of it happening. I just hope everyone can regain focus 
and like you said, remember why we are here.

I hope you feel better soon, and rejoin us when the stress level is 
passed. And I hope it passes soon so ya can run some test sessions 
with the new tool that arrived!

I keep telling people that all the negativity does take a toll, on us 
personally and our working together.

&gt; I&#x27;m out of here until all this petty BS and hatred sorts out. The  
&gt; amount of stress that I&#x27;ve been through with all this fighting 
since  
&gt; early this year has really taken a toll on me as a person and a  
&gt; researcher. I&#x27;m going off line for awhile. If anyone wants to talk 
to  
&gt; me, send me a private e-mail because I&#x27;m going to read only/no e-
mail  
&gt; until I remember again why I used to wake up every day and want to  
&gt; run to my computer to see what would be posted.
&gt; 
&gt; Misty--as per your request, I&#x27;ve deleted my files.
