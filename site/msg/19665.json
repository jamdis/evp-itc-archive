&quot; is what I am after. &nbsp;If a posit=\r\nive hit like this happens, then I will be jumping for joy. &nbsp;Another go=\r\nod example would be a name, lets say Tom, that occurs. &nbsp;If you get a p=\r\nositive affirmation that the name you heard is present, then you try the sa=\r\nme technique only you address Tom by name and get a face, that would be eve=\r\nn better.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;But, as it stands now, the faces as th=\r\ney appear are random at best. &nbsp;I would be more inclined to believe tha=\r\nt when these faces do occur , they are going to occur with a lesser frequen=\r\ncy than multiple images in a few seconds of audio like Ursula&#39;s example. &n=\r\nbsp;If this where the case, there would be dozens, and possibly hundreds, o=\r\nf faces during a ten minute session and I just don&#39;t think that is possible=\r\n. &nbsp;This is why I need to look at several samples to find out if this i=\r\ns the case or not. &nbsp;If these partialized faces occur in multiples all =\r\nthe time, I would be more apt to discount it. &nbsp;But, if they are a rari=\r\nty affixed to only a few clips out of dozens, I would be more inclined to b=\r\nelieve in them. &nbsp;Sample size is everything. &nbsp;It is like listening=\r\n to GBC. &nbsp;If you have never done a session before, you would be inclin=\r\ned to believe every stray radio signal is a communication. &nbsp;Only by co=\r\nntinued practice\n (expanding your sample size) can you start to rule out st=\r\nray radio with any degree of accuracy. &nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;On=\r\n the other hand, I am very new to this and I could certainly be wrong. &nbs=\r\np;I will continue to plug sound into the programs and hope for the best. &n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I really want this to work. &nbsp;As you ha=\r\nve probably experienced, when they want you to hear something or know somet=\r\nhing, they make it very obvious while communicating. &nbsp;I am hoping they=\r\n apply this same rigor to this new format to show us that they are there. &=\r\nnbsp;If they can, then the world of video and audio ITC will merge in one s=\r\nource and then the skeptics be damned!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Tim&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;On Sat, Dec 18, 2010 at 2:24 PM, Frank Sumption &lt;SPAN dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt=\r\n;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dpurplealiengirl=\r\n@...&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;purplealiengirl@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;/SPAN&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;I think it&#39;s unrealistic to expect every file to have =\r\nfaces and images.

At first it was I thought it was a software glitc=\r\nh but it is a repeatable event. It was on LiveSciFi which is run by Tim Woo=\r\nd, he also thought there was some kind of code error but it happened on mor=\r\ne than one webcast. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So if anyone has Audition, just feed Box output=\r\n right in your computer and see what happens. I wanted to try it tonight bu=\r\nt I have Audacity and the spectragraph feature doesn&#39;t have that shaded app=\r\nearance that Audition does so it&#39;s not able to render images or characters,=\r\n at least as far as I see using the various settings.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--=\r\n- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3DEVP-ITC%40y=\r\nahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;,=\r\n Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have tried =\r\nnumerous EVP files and short box clips and so far&lt;BR&gt;&gt; nothing discernib=\r\nle has appeared on either program.
