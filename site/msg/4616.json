There are many\nwho believe that communication is between the conscious of the\nresearcher and the entity and the equipment is secondary. It&#39;s easy to\nget swept up in the technology and forget there is possibly a psychic\nconnection going on. With that said, focusing on equipment actually\ncan help the researcher become receptive to establishing a\ncommunication link. While paying attention to the equipment, we forget\nabout the daily distractions and minor irritations that may prevent us\nfrom establishing contact. \n\nThe setting up the gear we use could be considered the first part of\nthe &quot;ritual&quot;. I like to clear my mind, set up equipment, mess with it\nsome more, then I am mentally prepare to begin what I hope will be a\nsuccessful session.\n\nI guess &quot;random&quot; recording to me would be what happens in the field\nduring a paranormal investigation. I don&#39;t bring Box technology into a\nlocation with the intention of possibly contacting lingering spirits\nat that location but I do bring audio recorders in hopes of recording\nevp&#39;s.\n\nI find the Box works perhaps even better when I&#39;m in a familiar place\nlike the room in my home that is designated for that purpose. I do\ndesire to have the finest Box technology that is possible but more\nimportant is the association that seems to occur between the\nresearcher and the Box that is favored. Despite some of the benefits\nof the new gear, the one that I seem to have a connection with is one\nthat requires a little more finesse to operate.  -Bill\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robin Henson&quot; &lt;MudPuddleFarm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Wow, thanks for your help guys!\n&gt; \n&gt; Ursula, your post was lovely.  I&#39;ve been promising myself to learn \n&gt; more about Mark Macy&#39;s work and will check out his website ASAP. \n&gt; Ritualized versus random recording makes sense to me now, as I want \n&gt; to accomplish true communication rather than continue being verbally \n&gt; abused. Have you given up &quot;ghost hunting&quot; altogether? \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been looking at the Olympus VN-4100 PC, Zack!  I don&#39;t know if I \n&gt; need that much recording time, but I sure have liked the one I have \n&gt; and wouldn&#39;t mind upgrading a bit.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Frank! I basically follow your suggestion when recording, and once \n&gt; I learned to be quiet I actually started getting responses. I think \n&gt; the entities at my house got tired of playing with me though, and now \n&gt; they aren&#39;t saying anything.  I kind of miss them, but I do feel it&#39;s \n&gt; time to move on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Robin \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Robin,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Radio Shack now carries the Olympus VN-4100PC at about the same \n&gt; price I \n&gt; &gt; paid for my VN-960PC a couple years ago.  I&#39;ve been very happy with \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; 960. The 4100 has about 4 times the recording time, I think. That \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; make it about 24 hours.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zack\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Sat, 29 Dec 2007, Robin Henson wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to the group but probably know some of you from another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; list.  I haven&#39;t been too active in the realm of EVP recording\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recently, but have had what I consider excellent results in the \n&gt; past\n&gt; &gt; &gt; using my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 PC.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; overwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using.  I know a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little about using good headphones and denoiser programs, but \n&gt; beyond\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that I&#39;m electronically challenged.  Still, I wonder if there are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; simple techniques I can experiment with to increase my success.  I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think I&#39;m a little bored.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#39;ve been communicating with a very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; small number of entities, and I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s due to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs have always \n&gt; been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside on the hill and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; near the barn.  I&#39;ve gotten two inside my house (after inviting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative \n&gt; messages.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;m thinking about getting another DVR and would love to \n&gt; hear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are best.  I \n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities eventually, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunately don&#39;t have the brain for building anything myself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Robin\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
