I had it\nhooked up to a Behringer Xenyx 1622FX mixer along with a Shure SM58\nmicrophone running to the computer and recorded in Audacity.  \n\nI live in Dayton, Ohio. There there are a handful of AM stations\naround.  The most prominent being 700 WLW out of Cincinnati.  The\nproblem I&#39;ve run into is that the stations that come in clearly start\nanywhere from 2-4 bands before and after their actual frequency.\n\nI also have a RS 20-125.  I&#39;m getting ready to do another session in a\nfew minutes so I&#39;ll use the 20-125.  I know it probably won&#39;t make\nmuch of a difference as far as signal goes, but I&#39;m gonna try it out.\n\nJeremy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday\n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Are you using a 12-469 or 470 ?\n&gt; If you are using a 469, what is the set up\n&gt; are you recording directly from the box and \n&gt; using a splitter with a speaker attached ?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Or recording from the stand alone 470?\n&gt;  \n&gt; The reason I ask is because other than the single word response you\n&gt; are receiving, I hear no indication of the RS box sweeping the stations.\n&gt; It is all static noise except for the message. \n&gt;  \n&gt; You are not getting any signal at all.\n&gt; you should be hearing the different stations change and continuous\nfragments of speech\n&gt; while the box sweeps the band.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let me know where you are and how you are setting up for a session.\nIf you are getting that response without any clear signal\n&gt; think of how you will communicate with even a half way decent signal.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@...: EVP-ITC@...: Mon, 28 Jan 2008 22:50:54\n+0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,This email message is a notification to let you know thata\nfile has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC group.File :\n/Jeremy&#39;s Files/Session 1 review_what is name_STU.wav Uploaded by :\necuyler &lt;ecuyler@...&gt; Description : 3 what is name_STU You can access\nthis file at the\nURL:http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jeremy%27s%20Files/Session%201%20review_what%20is%20name_STU.wav\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please\nvisit:http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfilesRegards,ecuyler\n&lt;ecuyler@...&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Climb to the top of the charts!
