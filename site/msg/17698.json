That&#39;s what that is,&quot; and promptly quit this list.\n\nIt&#39;s the mystery that keeps this interesting... wondering what the voices are, what the messages mean (and which ones are worth taking seriously), why some people seem to hear them better than others, and so on.\n\nI know that I heard voices with Chris Moon that I absolutely, positively cannot explain, except in terms of a parallel world/reality, or something like that.  And the replies to what I was saying were completely illogical, if someone was trying to do a &quot;cold reading.&quot;  \n\nSo, for me it&#39;s a mystery, and a fascinating one!\n\nCheerfully,\nFiona\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n... \n&gt; \n&gt;  I get more than alittle annoyed by people that act like this stuff is all cut and dried, all perfectly understood, and known--all easily explained. \n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
