Hi Suzanne,

The Ovilus and Frank's Box are two completely different a=
nimals, so-
to-speak.
One is a series of circuits that cause a radio freque=
ncy to sweep 
using a method of "white noise" to stimulate that sweep patte=
rn, 
while the other is a series of digital circuits using a number of 
sen=
sors(I'm guessing)to stimulate speech and cascading LEDs to 
perform based =
on what mode it's in.

My box was thrown together as a vacation hobby, with=
 more added as I 
found more room to add... and as I found interesting devi=
ces on 
paranormal websites.
I did scribble some schematics down as I went,=
 and I guess I should 
try to gather those up and put together some sort of=
 diagram.

Let me work on that... in my spare time. :-)
When I'm done, I'll=
 make sure to put it on my website, and notify 
everyone here.

Have a supe=
r-natural paranormal day!
