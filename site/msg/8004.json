It is based on harmony of energy=\r\n and spirit\nbetween yourself and your technician. The tech acts as a modera=\r\ntor or go between for your communication sessions\nguarding that open doorwa=\r\ny and assisting in any way that is needed to help get your communications a=\r\ncross and\nthe responses that you receive will either come through him or he=\r\nr, or your tech will help facilitate communication\nbetween another spirit a=\r\nnd the researcher.\n \nOn your next session ask about your tech and if you ha=\r\nve been assigned one, if so what is their name. \nIf you have been getting a=\r\n name that has been coming through consistently that is probably your tech.=\r\n\nAs you become more experienced and over the course of many sessions, like =\r\nany other person you deal with on a regular basis\nyou will develop a relati=\r\nonship with him or her. The stronger your bond becomes the better your comm=\r\nunication will get.\nAlso a very important factor in strong communication is=\r\n state of attitude, to have strong and beneficial communication you need to=\r\n approach \na session with a positive and open attitude. Good vibrations str=\r\nengthen the bridge, negative vibrations weaken it and attract negative ener=\r\ngy.\n \nI have been involved in the paranormal in one sense or another for al=\r\nmost ten years. I started as a field investigator and progressed to the poi=\r\nnt I am at today.\nWhen I discovered real time spirit communication, or box =\r\nresearch it was still in it&#39;s infancy. the only box being used by only a co=\r\nuple of individuals was Frank&#39;s box\nthrough contacts I made I became acquai=\r\nnted with Mr. Sumption and was lucky enough to receive a Frank&#39;s box #12 Al=\r\nso at that time Joe&#39;s box had been established \nand I received one of those=\r\n and started my research. At that time there where only about three of us t=\r\nat where doing continuous research and stumbling around\nTrying to figure ou=\r\nt what, when, why and how! but that&#39;s what led us to helping develop the co=\r\nmmunication. And eventually learn enough to be able to help \nothers that be=\r\ncome interested in becoming box researchers.\n \nAs far as conducting your se=\r\nssions, you are only just starting out. You need time and our friends on th=\r\ne other side need time to get to know each other.\nEach of us has our own un=\r\nique spiritual energy and like someone that joins say a softball team just =\r\nas an example. you will be treated cautiously but it will take time to get =\r\n\nfamiliar with your team mates and become an accepted member of the team.\nS=\r\ntart with short common questions and comments and expect short and sometime=\r\ns no response in the beginning. that is not due to their lack of wanting to=\r\n communicate\nbut like I said it takes time to build that bond and make the =\r\nchannels of communication strong and reliable. Ask basic questions that wil=\r\nl most likely result in you hearing \nand understanding the answers in real =\r\ntime, this will not only develop your confidence as a researcher but also g=\r\nive you the personal validation that we all need to know\nthat in fact we ar=\r\ne communicating.\n \nAND record everything!! I can&#39;t stress that enough. In t=\r\nhe beginning until your ear is developed for filtering out the communicatio=\r\nn from the crap, you will need to\nrefer back to the recording to confirm wh=\r\nat you believe you heard.\n \nI hope this helps.\n \nBruce\n\n\nBruce Halliday \n\n\n=\r\n\n\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\nFrom: f1cracker75@ yahoo.com\nDate: Tue, 18 M=\r\nar 2008 17:45:19 -0700\nSubject: RE: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n=\r\n\nBruce, have you been able to contact your personal friends and family memb=\r\ners yet?
