LOL, fart in church....!? I agree, there is a huge distinction between the =
two. Random EVPer's or haunting investigations have a completely different =
mindset and attitude. Most PI's I have known over the last few years (even =
the famous ones) are like children stabbing a knife into the darkness in fr=
ont of them. They have no clue that you can investigate with the lights on =
(if you know what I mean). They are usually more into the drama than the ac=
tual research.

Even after showing them my files and explaining that I get =
these at will they still don't believe it. Even the ones that use my name a=
nd theirs...they think its some kind of trick.

Just my two cents,
