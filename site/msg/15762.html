<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Everyone. I love this group and I have for a LONG time! I&#x27;ve NEVER
caused a problem here.I&#x27;m not mad at anyone. I just  saw what this group of
characters did to another forum, so I felt the need to warn you.
You can ask Steve Brooks at the Magic Cafe about the names they called him
before he banned them. It started just like this.
I LOVE EVP&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve been interested in them for YEARS !!!!!!
I&#x27;ve never said anything bad about Frank or anyone who is doing research.
Please ask yourself Misty ... Where did all these new characters come from
and why are they already name calling etc.?
They are here for the sole purpose to disrupt this group. I&#x27;m sad to see it.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I am getting pretty tired of a few whos sole purpose in this group is to
&gt;&gt; provoke Frank and other members into negativity. If it continues you and
&gt;&gt; your fake nicknames will be removed. Your attempts to promote your &quot;other
&gt;&gt; group&quot; will be viewed as spam and deleted as such. They may go unnoticed by
&gt;&gt; the group but they dont go unnoticed by me. Funny how its always just that
&gt;&gt; one person/group that you promote while every post you make is not about
&gt;&gt; your research or anyone elses but rather a play on words meant to provoke
&gt;&gt; someone. You should run a quick background check on your friend the owner of
&gt;&gt; that &quot;other group&quot; you may find you know less than you thought you did. You
&gt;&gt; know who you are. And so do I.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; As for Frank, he knows I dont always agree with what he says. He knows I
&gt;&gt; definitely dont agree with the namecalling or public venting. Having said
&gt;&gt; that. Frank is the founder of this group. As such he will ALWAYS have a
&gt;&gt; voice here. Those who dont like that or dont agree are free to move on.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; If you are here to learn about EVP-ITC, Frank&#x27;s Box, or share your
&gt;&gt; research, by all means do so. If you are here for another purpose then dont
&gt;&gt; be surprised when you go to sign in and find you are no longer a member
&gt;&gt; here.

&gt;&gt; Hi Misty,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I joined this group a long time ago...pretty much a silent observer. I
&gt;&gt; don&#x27;t even read all of the emails I get on updates. I thought when I saw the
&gt;&gt; whole name calling thing it was some sensitive person whining about a spirit
&gt;&gt; saying colorful things to them...then I read a few. ARE THEY SERIOUS. Please
&gt;&gt; know there are many people who agree with you and Frank and agree whole
&gt;&gt; heartedly you should delete the faint of heart...LOL. Can you imagine how
&gt;&gt; they would react to a simple BOO from a voice from beyond? LOL...what fools.
&gt;&gt;
