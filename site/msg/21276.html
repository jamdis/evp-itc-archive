<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>don&#x27;t let the fact that it can be heard both ways be seen as something discouraging, because to me it&#x27;s not at all.... just amazingly fascinating!!!... that&#x27;s just the nature of perception, very subjective.... people disagree  on the truth even when using all five senses... imagine having to debate the truth as perceived only through ONE sense.... this is what we&#x27;re dealing with in ghost boxing....  again, awesome file there...

&gt;  Tune in a foreign language you don&#x27;t understand, sit the recorder near the
&gt; pseaker, announce you&#x27;re doing an EVP recording, and rtecord a while. the
&gt; messages are mixed in with the broadcast. Curiously, people that speak that
&gt; language won&#x27;t hear anything but the original broadcast. I know--nobody hear
&gt; it.
