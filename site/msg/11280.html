<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am concerend because Chris Moon is using Frank&#x27;s box under his name to make money.  He 
charges $250 for a half hour session with this box.  I wouldn&#x27;t be so irritated had he just 
called it something else, but this is Frank&#x27;s and it should be up to Frank how this box is used.  
I think using it to make money is wrong.  I am not saying it would be wrong for Frank to 
market it it, at a reasonable price, but to charge $250 for a session that is under the 
interpretation of Chris Moon is just playing on those who are suffering from a loss and 
looking for a connection.</pre>
