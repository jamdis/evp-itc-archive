I&#39;m Roxy.  live in Sedona arizona.  \n\nI am a medium and animal communicator.  Not public.  \nI just do it to honor spirit.  And find lost souls.\n\nSo yes, i&#39;ve worked with the spirits and what I can honestly say.\nAs I communicate.  Even with the angels.  I don&#39;t see the mouth \nmoving.  I see it as telepathic communication.   So not meaning no\ndisrespect .   Or wanting to be hostel .  I am just wondering how \ndoes this voice box pick up voices.   Vibs, or EMF.  Can you explain \nit.    \n\nBlessings.  Roxy"}
