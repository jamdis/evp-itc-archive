It was designed to go along with a sound capture device by Int=
el.  It
has a lot of functions, some which are not outlined in the 11 page
=
brochure at the link. I selected the niose reduction option, the
increase l=
ouder option, and a function that added audible frequency
range when stimul=
ated by the file that was input (raw with noise
reductio file).
