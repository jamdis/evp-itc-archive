Again, I&#x27;ve got to speak up and say that I have heard his box, the  
one Frank gave him, do exactly that. And why in the heck shouldn&#x27;t  
it? That is exactly what human mediums--myself included--can do.  
Isn&#x27;t the box just taking it to a potentially purer, higher, and more  
stunning level?
&gt; I&#x27;d contact a lawyer - for infringment rights to your device  
&gt; (unauthorised use), on a contingency basis (pay if you win the  
&gt; lawsuit, from the winnings). Plus, you could get your boxes, Sony  
&gt; cassette recorder, and Tarot CD back, as well as put him outta  
&gt; business, before he does more damage! =Judy= P.S. He may know you  
&gt; well enought to know you&#x27;ll never sue him, too (and thus get away  
&gt; with it)! 8-(
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; _

You can&#x27;t sue for use of non-patented technology that was a gift. It  
would be very hard for Frank to prove otherwise.

Ah, but what a hell of a civil trial it would be. There&#x27;s one I&#x27;d  
love to cover as a reporter....
