Now, \nwhile engaged in this structured in-home ITC experimentation, I am \ngetting a lot of different results and hearing a lot of conflicting \ninformation.\n\nMy first voice I heard in real time through my headphones, and it \ncame as a gravelly whisper in reponse to my question.  My second \nvoice was loud and clear but I didn&#39;t hear it through the headphones \nwhile recording.\n\nFrom all of the talk about the various boxes, I am hearing that the \ngreat thing about them--and the allegedly dangerous thing--is that \nyou can have conversations in real time because you can hear the \nresponses while recording.  But, from what I&#39;ve read in extensive \nsources, I have garnered that the messages are IMBEDDED into the tape \nduring the recording and cannot be heard until playback.  \n\nBut I HAVE gotten real time responses, so  . . . since I have gotten \nresponses in real time without a box, is it that the boxes increase \nthe incidence of real time answers?  Or am I trying to find solid \nanswers to questions that are still not answerable?\n\nHope this makes sense, and thanks,\nUrsula"}
