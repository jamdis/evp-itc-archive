Yes, this one is not even close to a class "A". I usually just chuck someth=
ing such as this but I wanted to see what others thought. In the hall it wa=
s only 1 lady and myself. You can hear her speaking and then the evp whispe=
rs. Considering the events at the time I kept this one.

y from Gel,Steph and Elissa and Jason, who had all just walked out on the p=
atio to confront the "lady" who was seen sitting outside. Is it possible th=
at she follow that other women and I down the hall expressing her desire to=
 be left alone?
