A trip to the vet will answer that question, usually most breaks can be set unless there is another underlying problem. It is a cute lil dog, sometimes they are very fragile bone structures because of breeding. There are a few small dogs that seem to have alot of problems with bad backs and breaking legs/feet. 
   
  I think its proof to those who want it, and as for me...nobody is talking about me on the radio, or using my full name...so it definitely gets my attention when my name is being used in context with things that are going on around me or happening to people I know.
   
  I dont need any proof, they just give it freely so I can share or in some cases not share with everyone.
   
  I stopped lookin for proof right about the time this all started. My first evp was all that I needed to get me on this path. My mothers voice, so long after shes been passed, friends, relatives, or even perfect strangers who I had no clue about until I found out after the fact....way too many proofs have been freely given to me, and I never asked for one. Earl and Bob Cox, I think thats one of my favorite WOW moments, not knowing about Erland Babcock it was an easy misunderstanding. Luckily I make everything phonetic so it was easy to catch later. I have listened to others evp from him since then and I often STILL hear earl and bob cox. They have also given me names of workers on this side who I have bumped into later tho I usually put off contacting anyone they mention until I think the time is right. Usually it is just weird to find out its a REAL LIVE person and that they just happen to be in the EVP/ITC field. 
   
  I used to always assume when they say a name they are talking about spirits there. Or that if I get an ITC image its a spirit face. They proved thats a wrong assumption on several occasions. Probably the only time I ever asked for anything was while doing an itc session, after so many faces I just wanted them to show me something else, anything else, "show me something different" led to a few portraits of the living.
   
  Sometimes they speak the truth, sometimes a wayward thought creeps threw that shouldnt (or just a creep)... as for the dog...take it to the vet and see what they can do then you will know more.

We do have a dog with a broken leg, so it would seem outrageous to suggest the comment received about a dog and a break would be just a stray broadcast. I hate to have an animal suffer, but what a piece of evidence! This is what I mean  by judging content and context. 
 
 I don't ask questions, I did not ask about the dog. I was only testing the #24 box, and announced, as usuall, that I was doing an EVP recording to test the box.
