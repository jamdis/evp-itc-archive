Again, though, I really couldn't make out any discernable words with it. Bu=

erception is Probabilistic


      Thought these comments might be interest=
ing in light of recent
      threads. Dr. Sam El-Khazen recently published =
an article in the
      Journal of Neuroquantology (study of brain function=
 at the quantum
      mechanical level). In this paper entitled "DNA The Ga=
teway to
      Time", El-Khazen talks about the relationship between the st=
ructure
      of DNA, time, conscious perception and gravity. There is cred=
ible
      evidence that these are intimately correlated. 

      An import=
ant finding for this group has to do with how we may in
      fact detect e=
xternal influences in the physical world. If El-Khazen
      has it right, =
two EM waves must align in order for the preception
      process to even b=
egin. If this does not happen, there is nothing to
      perceive, even tho=
ugh we may be impacted by an external potentially
      influencing EM wave=
. The second wave is generated from borrowed
      energy within our brain =
cells and is modelled upon the structure of
      DNA strands. So yes we ar=
e impacted by billions of EM signals per
      second but we actually detec=
t only a small portion of these that we
      later process in the late-sta=
ge perceptual processes. 

      This would nicely explain why two people w=
ould perceive events
      differently despite the fact that they were lite=
rally side by side
      witnessing the same event. Again this is strictly =
a matter of
      random probability, it seems to have nothing whatsoever t=
o do with
      volition or intention. That is more the focus of the later
=
      perceptual processing which is in turn dependent upon this
      prob=
abilistic process.

      This could also explain why it is that EVP and IT=
C signals are
      perceived differently by different people even when no =
physical
      alteration to the media has occurred and why different thing=
s are
      heard more easily at different times by the same person.
