Whilst researching trying to find other methods of capturing them I found the EVP Maker and Speakerjet Allophones method. I recorded a couple of sessions where I  ran EVP Maker and random generated Speakerjet Allophones whilst asking questions and recording on a voice recorder. The recordings were made in a private house which has paranormal activity. \n\nThe questions that I asked were EVP 1: What is your name? EVP 2: What is your name? EVP 3: What do I use a pen for? (I was holding a pen in my hand and it was a spontaneous question!)\n\nThese results have been added to my podzparapodz folder and I would be grateful of your opinions about them.\n\nThanks very much. Lara."}
