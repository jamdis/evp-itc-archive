Please understand this is no=\r\nt a typical thing here\n  it is a rare occasion.\n   \n  To answer your questi=\r\non, I have been a long time researcher and do research daily with every box=\r\n that is available today\n  including a Frank&#39;s box.\n   \n  If you already ha=\r\nve your RS box and it is modified, you are 75% of the way there. \n  I will =\r\nexplain in detail how to do a successful session.\n  Let your spirit friends=\r\n know you are about to turn the box on and ask if they would please join yo=\r\nu in a communication session.\n  Turn on your recording device(whichever you=\r\n choose to record the session) state the date and time and number the sessi=\r\non so you have a referral at a later date.\n  Turn your RS box on and start =\r\nthe scan. I prefer and always use the AM band to do a session, it is less c=\r\nluttered than FM and I find it easier to hear real time messages and answer=\r\ns.\n  At first you can ask simple questions that will require short answers =\r\nsuch as &quot; are there any spirits listening that wish to communicate with me&quot;=\r\n \n  &quot;can you say my name&quot;, &quot; can you tell me your name&quot; questions along tho=\r\nse line will glean short understandable answers and messages.

Do not get d=\r\niscouraged if you do not hear any responses the first couple of sessions. O=\r\nur friends need time to adjust to a new researcher and assign you a technic=\r\nian.\n  But you can rest assured the communication will come.\n   \n  Keep the=\r\n sessions to a limit of 10 to 15 minutes as to not overwhelm yourself when =\r\nyou need to listen back carefully to the recording or stress the energy sup=\r\nply of your spirit contacts.\n   \n  When you are done with your session let =\r\nyour spirit friends know you are about to end the session and turn the box =\r\noff and give them about ten seconds before you do turn the box off.\n   \n  e=\r\nxtend the same courtesy as you would speaking to someone on the phone, say =\r\ngoodbye and thank you and you will almost always get a cordial response.\n  =\r\n \n  shut your box and again thank them for their efforts. you have now done=\r\n a rudimentary box session. load it onto the computer and review it for mes=\r\nsages and answers to your question that you missed during the live session.=\r\n when you have done this post a message to the board and I will explain how=\r\n to do a basic edit of the recording to better understand the responses tha=\r\nt are less clear.\n   \n  good luck Carol and I am looking forward to researc=\r\nhing with you.\n   \n  Bruce\n\n\n\n\n  Bruce Halliday \n\n\n\n  &lt;http://free-paranorm=\r\nalinvestigating.com/%3C/div%3E%3C/div%3E%3Cp%20/%3E%3Cdiv%20class=3D&gt;\n\n\n\n--=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n    To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n    From: cbreck@...\n    Date: Tue, =\r\n22 Jan 2008 11:05:35 -0600\n    Subject: [EVP-ITC] How to start\n\n\n    Hi all=\r\n,\n\n    I&#39;ve been reading all the posts for the last couple days....I&#39;m a li=\r\nttle\n    afraid to ask but here goes....I&#39;m experienced with evp...but know=\r\n nothing\n    about the radio shack hack....could someone tell me step by st=\r\nep how to\n    have a session?
