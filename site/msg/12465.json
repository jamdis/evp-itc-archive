Right under the 24 Nov 2007 date \nevent.\n\nhttp://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/10/move-over-franks-box-radio-\nshack-hack.html\n\nBy-the-way:\nI&#39;ve got the new version of the 12-470 (black case) torn apart on my \nbench again.  I know I failed to get it hacked the first time (last \nyear), but I figured I&#39;d try it again.  It is totally different than \nthe others... and they have made sure you can&#39;t tell what the radio \nchip is by getting rid of the markings and covering both sides of the \ncircuit board with a waxy substance. I&#39;ve been carefully scraping it \naway. The chip is a 30 pin device, possibly a KK22425 or KK22426 or \nequivilent.\nThe mute pin for the #25 is pin 2 but looking at the connection \nscheme itmight not be the right one.\nI guess I&#39;ll mess with it until I break it... or ???\n\nI&#39;ll put some pictures of the new 12-470 circuit board in my photo \narea of this froum.\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike,\n&gt; \n&gt; You forgot to mention that i was the first to do the hack after \nBill \n&gt; and post files that same day.  I also stumbled across 3 other RS \n&gt; radios that i hacked (12-820, 20-125, 12-150) to share with other \n&gt; researchers.  A mention would have been nice in your blog, but you \n&gt; contribute a lot of time too and we all appreciate it.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Last night on Haunted Times Magazine radio , guest Brian Harnois \n&gt; (Ghost\n&gt; &gt; Hunters International) told the radio listening audience that he \n&gt; didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; think anyone should use a Franks&#39; Box, (or a ghost box is what he \n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; insinuating) unless they had training from Christopher Moon.\n&gt; &gt; So... that is the topic of my blog write-up this morning if you \n&gt; care to\n&gt; &gt; read it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/10/ghost-box-is-training-\n&gt; required.h&#92;\n&gt; &gt; tml\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/10/ghost-box-is-training-\n&gt; required.&#92;\n&gt; &gt; html&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com &lt;http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks....
