I \njust posted a file which reflects why I do two types of communication \nsessions.  \n\nThis file labeled Frank, is,experiements, sometimes shows just how \ncommunication can be missed because while we are speaking, they are \nresponsing.\n\nFrank S. doesn&#39;t ask questions during his sessions to ensure great \ncommunication and that the delivery of messages are received correctly.\nI do them both ways, however, this particular clip is one in which I \npersonally get mad at myself given I spoke over them not getting the \nbest communication.\n\nI hate when this happens because I feel very rude to them, for I \nwouldn&#39;t want to interupt one of my friends conversation and believe \nthat these rules apply regardless of whomn I am speaking.\n\nJuli"}
