Hey,
 
I have worked with the 469, 470, 125 , and the sangean.
The best re=
sults I have so far are from the 469 - even with the clicking!
Like you, I =
just tune out the clicking - but our video guy can't stand it.

I am using the 12-469 radio h=
acked by myself with the help of UFOGeek's step by step video on youtube.

Sorry for not stating that earlier. I wish i had the older one 12-470 with =
the built in speaker. from the video's i been watching it doesn't seem to h=
ave that annoying click in between each AM channel.

After conditioning my =
ears i can block outthat clicking noise now, but my teammates can't and get=
 distracted from it.
