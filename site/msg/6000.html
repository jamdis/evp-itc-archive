<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce,

Please breathe and relax. You&#x27;re very stressed today, obviously. How  
can so few and little flames mean anything to someone who has been  
through the terrible fires that you have? You matter here and your  
help is invaluable. You are also our friend and would be terribly  
missed here.

Peace and affection,

Ann

&gt; Fellow researchers,
&gt;
&gt; I have decided to back away from participating in this group for a
&gt; while. The constant clash of ego&#x27;s and childish bickering of which I
&gt; have become a big part has begun to affect my research in a negative
&gt; way.
&gt; I have been advised to retreat from being an active part of this
&gt; group for an undetermined amount of time. I would like to stay on the
&gt; rolls as a member but will not actively participate as far as posting
&gt; results, files or opinions and advice.
&gt;
&gt; I will however be posting the results of my research on my box website
&gt; if there are any of you who would like to hear them.

&gt;
&gt; For the new members, please do not let my comments on this matter
&gt; affect your opinion of this research. I have chosen not to
&gt; participate here for personal reasons. I will be devoting all my
&gt; energy to advancing the communication and technology.
&gt;
&gt; If any new members feel they value my advice please feel free to
&gt; privately e-mail me paranormalinvestigating@...
&gt;
&gt; I will be glad to help anyone but will not offer advice on any
&gt; subjects posted here.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you to all the friends that I have managed to make here you
&gt; have been an immeasurable help.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you
