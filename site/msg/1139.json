That&#39;s where the pix \non the group home page came from. I think you already got this one. I did \nshow it the movie clip for docu-drama guys. One of the neighbor kids says he \ncan get stuff from TV, just like we do by tuing across the band, mostly it&#39;s \naudio messages.\n\nFrank\n\n\n&gt;From: Ken Thomas &lt;kennnthomas2000@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: evp-itc &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] patterns and categories of voice-like receptions , so \n&gt;far\n&gt;Date: Fri, 13 Apr 2007 12:38:39 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt;\n&gt;note to x:\n&gt;\n&gt;      i  think &quot;necroradio&quot; might put people off. i like the other one \n&gt;tho-poryphoradio\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\n&gt;   i notice that the chance emanations from this thing make my fluoresvcent \n&gt;markers glo like an el panel.\n&gt;\n&gt;   what is so useful is that , in my absence from spook-o-vision,  ordinary \n&gt;tech has advanced to where i can listen in real time--not near well enough \n&gt;to understand what theyre saying though.\n&gt;   nevertheless , you can tell a lot by the shape of the transmissions -  \n&gt;mostly buoyant young adult types.  theres often chanting like monks and \n&gt;to-and-fro like cheerleaders at football game, peculiar group, \n&gt;&quot;sing-talking&quot;.    lone mature male voices are usually in foreign accent . \n&gt;theres a lot of clues just in the envelope.\n&gt;   im making tapes for evidence but they are pretty crappy so far.\n&gt;\n&gt;   not the faintest trace of perfidy\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExercise your brain!
