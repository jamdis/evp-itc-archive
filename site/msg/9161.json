His concern being that we might \nwipe out the 12-469 availability.  Maybe you could mention all the models, or none of \nthem (just be more generic in the ad).  This way, people can be drawn to one model or \nanother naturally, rather than being guided toward the 12-469 (which honestly, I think the \nclick-click-clicking on the new version is a distraction).  \n\nIf I were to start from scratch, looking at all the choices, I would have gone with the 12-\n820 first.  It&#39;s great that additional models have been discovered to be hackable.  Thanks \nmuch to those who have brought this information to our attention!\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is a mock ad I made to put up on ebay.

All you need to do is go to your \n&gt; local Radio Shack and pick up the 12-469  Digital AM/FM Pocket Radio \n&gt; for ONLY $24.99 plus tax and with a simple modification. You will \n&gt; have your very own cheap alternative to a &quot;GHOST BOX&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; (I will insert a picture of the RS 12-469 here)\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; This simple modification lets the radio sweep both the AM and FM \n&gt; band. Instead of it scanning and stopping on a station, doing the \n&gt; modification (clipping the &quot;Mute&quot; pin) lets it just sweep the entire \n&gt; band, without stopping on any station. Just hook your Radio up to \n&gt; some speakers or headphones and while the radio is sweeping the \n&gt; bands start asking questions and get answers in real time.  You can \n&gt; also record it and review it later for answers you may have missed.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are several sites for the FREE instructions on how to modify \n&gt; your Radio Shack 12-469.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://ufogeek.com/?p=81\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozhaY1fW3s4 part 1\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2ZLABu0rK0 part 2\n&gt; \n&gt; For more information from the &quot;Experts&quot; on Ghost Boxes and EVPS you \n&gt; can also go to:\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck and happy ghost hunting!!!!!!!!!!\n&gt;"}
