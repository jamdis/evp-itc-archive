That&#39;s funny because i was doing a \nsession over Skype with my sister and i told my sister i had to go and \neat and the box said &quot;Yeah Pizza&quot;.  They were close, i was having food \ndelivered from a pizza place but i was having lasagna.  Either way i \nthink they like pizza.  Maybe it&#39;s all they serve over there???\n\n-Steve H.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  This is the &quot;Ghostman&quot; an old digital Walkman, with a sweep \ngenerator,  amplifiers to drive stereo speakers, and line output for a \nrecorder.
