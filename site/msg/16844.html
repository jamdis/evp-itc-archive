No don't assume ALL "Christians" are like that.   There are at least 3 
typ=
es of Christians.  Mainstreamers, Like me, who belong to mainstream 
Protes=
tant churches--Like Methodist, Presbyterians and Episcopal, etc.  We 
are n=
either "literalists" or radical in our beliefs.  I believe all this 
parano=
rmal stuff and more without worrying about my faith.

There are also "FUNDY=
" (fundamentalist) "Christians" who get a bit too 
literal in their INTERPR=
ETATIONS of their KJV Bibles and 300 year old 
interpretations of their fou=
nders of their sects.  These folks, while well 
meaning, quibble about the =
meaning of every word and comma in their 
"Scriptures" which are translatio=
ns of translations of translations. And 
come up with some really wild, off=
 the wall "fourth-order interpretations" 
that find "Demons" under every ro=
ck and rosebush. I worked with a FUNDY 
guy once who could not even listen =
to "Secular radio"----Things of Earth 
were the devil's, Music therefore wa=
s the devil's, so any music that did 
not praise God (Hymns) were EVIL.  He=
 could only listen to church music on 
the radio.---Even the "modern" hymns=
 were deemed "evil" as some had a 
(Rock) "beat" he could feel in his lower=
 body.

The other Category of NOMINAL "Christians" are the "Screwball Chris=
tians" 
They are, according to their philosophy, "THE only people who are g=
oing to 
Heaven" (All the other sects are WRONG (somehow))  Usually based a=
round 
isolationism and some obscure verse in the Bible that only THEY take=
 
seriously.  These are the types who handle snakes and God knows what else=
 
in the same category of extremism.

While there are a LOT of " Fundies", =
 a sprinkling of "Screwball 
Christians", they are outnumbered by us "Mains=
treamers"  So one should not 
include US with those other sects.  They are =
the "holier than thou" 
"scribes and Pharisees" that Jesus himself warned u=
s about and constantly 
was at odds with during his ministry on earth.  It =
really puzzles me why 
those Bible nut fundies and screwballs cant see THAT=
 in the Book they 
claim to know so well.
