&gt; Hey Bill Thanks for describing your pin problem.   I&#x27;m the guy in
Mexico who recently wrote about trashing his new rs hack.  First the
battery cable separated then when fixed nothing.  I never noticed if
Mike said to be certain to line up the pins when putting the card back
together.  You said it so I check and now it actually works.  It is
something like checking the refrigerator light when you try to line up
the pins.  The real proof is when the thing powers up.  I also needed
to realign the five screws to make certain they were in the correct
holes.  Thanks for the tip.  Ron in Campeche Mexico

was getting the pins lined up to go back into
&gt; the edge connector after the mute pin has been cut /removed. It&#x27;s easy
&gt; to misalign them and bend one by accident. -Bill

&gt; &gt; Thanks Joel. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the problem anymore, though, as
&gt; the leads appear to be intact.

&gt; &gt; you can buy new leads at rs for like` $2.00 and get it to work

&gt; &gt; After viewing Mike&#x27;s RS 12-469 hack video for the fifth time I felt 
&gt; &gt; ready to take the plunge myself, so yesterday while dh was
&gt; picking up 
&gt; &gt; a pizza at Papa John&#x27;s I sneaked next door and bought the radio. He 
&gt; &gt; couldn&#x27;t stop complaining about how I&#x27;d wasted money on a perfectly 
&gt; &gt; good piece of equipment only to wreck it for my dumb hobby, but
&gt; once 
&gt; &gt; we got home he took it upon himself to test it and make sure it 
&gt; &gt; worked. For some reason it really DIDN&#x27;T work, so he took it
&gt; back to 
&gt; &gt; RS and exchanged it for another one, and after making sure THAT one 
&gt; &gt; worked he even offered to help me with the modification. &quot;No
&gt; thanks&quot; 
&gt; &gt; I told him. &quot;I think I need to do this myself.&quot; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I can&#x27;t pretend the process went as smoothly as I&#x27;d hoped, but 
&gt; &gt; finally I was done and making the last turn in the second screw of 
&gt; &gt; the circuit board.. and then.. The whole thing flew out of my hands 
&gt; &gt; and both battery wires ripped away from their soldered ends in the 
&gt; &gt; casing. It was all Bob could do to keep from gleefully yelling &quot;I 
&gt; &gt; knew you were going to break it!&quot; But then I guess he felt bad 
&gt; &gt; because he ran down to Walmart and got a soldering iron and solder 
&gt; &gt; and spent an hour trying to put it all back together for me. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s dead as a doornail, and I&#x27;m thinking that if I could break it 
&gt; &gt; that easily without even knowing how or why, maybe I&#x27;m not supposed 
&gt; &gt; to pursue this method (sigh). I guess I&#x27;ll just think it over and 
&gt; &gt; maybe try again later. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks for all the helpful information though Mike!
