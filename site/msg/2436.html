<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, anybody can buy a radio but if you don&#x27;t know what your 
listening for it causes a problem.  I&#x27;m not sure of a certain # of 
people, but i do not believe everyone can make out the voices.  I 
also think that some files i get that are so clear and nobody else 
hears proves that it was meant for only me.  I&#x27;ve accepted that now, 
but i feel if you can understand the messages---you have a gift and 
should use it.

&gt; Thanks. This is without a box, so if interested parties would like 
to try this just send check to......JUST KIDDING! The point is you 
don&#x27;t need anything special, the technology just doesn&#x27;t matter--
other than a radio of somekind-- they use what you use! All I do is 
automate the process. If my phone hadn&#x27;t died I would have sent a 
pix of the boom box. It&#x27;s just a mini boom box cassette/AM/FM radio. 
Probably cost 20 bucks brand new, a GPX brand, &quot;Grand Prix Home and 
Go music system with stereo cassette recorder and bass boost&quot;. I did 
the session at work, it shows you can do it anywhere. The dial isn&#x27;t 
even a single turn dial, it takes multiple twists (revolutions) to 
scan the entire band, or one could wobble between a few stations.

&gt; Frank, I hear both the way you hear them the &quot;doesn&#x27;t bother 
field &quot; is clear as a bell.I think the new boxes you are making are 
more along the lines of that type of clarityas apposed to the older 
boxes that generate a lot of white noise. Every day we get a step 
closer. Bruce

&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, it probably just depends on conditions. #3 was kinda iffy, 
and made out of noise. Here&#x27;s another. I just now went out to Field 
Elemenary to check a locate request. A locate request is to notify 
us that someone is digging somewhere in Littleton, and I have to 
verify that it will not hit any of our burried fiber. This was far 
enough away to not &quot;bother&quot; Field&#x27;s fiber. Mostly I like to put 
these up cuz it shows you need nothing but simple equipment, just an 
AM radio, and I used the built in recorder, so not even recording 
from the speaker! It&#x27;s so friggin&#x27; close to proof, but just can&#x27;t 
quite get it there! Frustrates me to no end.  Frank-S

&gt; Frank, I hear 1, 2 and 4 as you do very clearly but can&#x27;t make out 
more than &#x27;want&#x27;in #3. I had really good sucess with the manual 
sweeps also if you remember the posts. Bruce

&gt; 
&gt; I was checking out a little boom box here, and decided to do a 
quickie session using manual sweep of the AM band. This is at work
(don&#x27;t tell the boss!).  The one about the male dog might refer to 
the mate to this female poodle we have now. For those unfamilar, our 
daughter in-law knows someone that rescues dogs, and she was tryuing 
to get rid of some of her too many animals. The daughter in-law at 
first gave us the male poodle a few weeks ago, but he was deaf, 
blind, and someone, probably the puppy mill he came from, pulled all 
his teeth. He was too much to deal with, he fell down our stairs 
twice, and we felt he was suffereing too much, so we took him to the 
Dumb Friends League. Now we have his mate, but she has most of her 
teeth, and can hear, see and is a little sweetie. #4 is hopefully 
accurate.   Frank-S
