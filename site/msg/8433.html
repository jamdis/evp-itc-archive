<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>okay, okay!

Lets put this to bed here and now. 
My post was not about fear or the acknowledgment of it.
It was about the concerns of a new researcher!

And no matter what anyone&#x27;s opinion is regarding the subject matter, 
including my own.

The concern was real to the person that experienced it.
I felt that he would appreciate me addressing it publicly on the forum
on the chance that other &quot;NEW&quot; researchers may have similar concerns.

It was just what I posted it as &quot;an incident that may be a concern&quot;

It is not a matter of fear or pushing any buttons, it&#x27;s a matter of 
knowledge.
Even if that knowledge is important to only one individual, that does 
not make it any less important.

We have to remember that a lot of the new researchers and people 
getting interested in this field is due to the recent surge of 
publicity that we have gotten and all may not be seasoned paranormal 
veterans and adopted the philosophy of staring down the negative 
aspects of the paranormal.

And I don&#x27;t think that their education from any experienced 
researcher should include, if you ignore it that means it does not 
exist or can not affect any aspect of what we are doing.

I don&#x27;t want to open this whole can of worms again. 
If a new person voices a concern, and all concerns deserve to be 
addressed for the benefit of who ever needs it.

My opinion on it or post about a certain incident is not meant to be 
the word of god or carved in stone. It is just what it is
an opinion or a simple statement.
