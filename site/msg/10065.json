I&#39;m probably going to just scrap this \nsession, i spent 2 hours going over 45 seconds to bring out a message \nthat&#39;s so unclear to everyone else.  It&#39;s so frustrating that the \nradio method is so flawed, i want it to be clear and it never is.  \nAnd if i do get something that&#39;s interesting, most people will say \nit&#39;s just radio anyway.  That&#39;s why i&#39;m trying to get away from the \nradios, although it&#39;s robotic sounding---sound soap has been the best \nso far.  Clearer and longer messages, with hardly any editing.  The \nboxes are unable to get full sentences from them and i don&#39;t care \nwhat anybody else claims to get.  You will get some good &quot;yes&quot; \nand &quot;no&quot; answers, but the rest will be questioned and heard \ndifferently by others.  What does everyone else on this board think \nabout this?\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The only word I cant really make out is &quot;DIE&quot; kind of sounds like \n&gt; FIGHT to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Steves_gonna_fight_thats_horrible\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kay\n&gt; \n&gt;  --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; &gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; &gt; group.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   File        : /Steve Hultay Files/Steve Hultay&#39;s Frank&#39;s Box \n&gt; #27/steve&#39;s_gonna_die_horrible (Slowed down 10%).mp3 \n&gt; &gt;   Uploaded by : urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Description : &quot;Steve&#39;s Gonna Die Horrible&quot;---Does anybody else \n&gt; hear this?---Slowed it down another 10 percent \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Steve%20Hultay%\n&gt; 20Files/Steve%20Hultay%27s%20Frank%27s%20Box%20%2327/steve%\n&gt; 27s_gonna_die_horrible%20%28Slowed%20down%2010%25%29.mp3 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.ht\n&gt; mlfiles\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
