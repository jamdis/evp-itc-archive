<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I personally have seen Chris use his box in public forum four times.  
I have heard the box give audible yes and no type answers to peoples 
questions.  I do feel though that the ones that get emotionally moved 
the most are the ones wanting with all their heart to hear from a 
loved one.  When these people get an answer that may or may not be 
heard by all, they feel that it is indeed from a loved one and it 
hits them in the heart as if it was real.  I would love to hear a 
recorded session from start to finish as an investigator.  After all 
this research is for all not just &quot;30&quot;....  :-)

&gt; Robin-- I have watched this clip and it is the least convincing of  
&gt; all the ones I have seen of him with the box. I have heard several  
&gt; where some of the audio is clear enough to stand on its own 
without  
&gt; his interpretation, and where his interpretation generally agrees. 
I  
&gt; have also heard some where the audio I hear disagrees with his  
&gt; interpretation, but not to such a high degree that I was overtly  
&gt; troubled by it--it was in what I would call the high-end of my  
&gt; tolerance range for subjectivity.  I have heard audio where the  
&gt; person asking questions of the box clearly heard answered that  
&gt; appeared to move them greatly without dependance on Chris&#x27;s  
&gt; interpretation.
&gt; 
&gt; So, to try to sum up for you, my personal investigation led me to  
&gt; believe that something was happening with the box. I did not 
always  
&gt; agree with Chris&#x27;s interpretation, but it appeared the same or 
close  
&gt; to what I heard a high enough percentage of the time that I was  
&gt; willing to accept he was not faking it, but giving it an honest  
&gt; enough go. It led me to start hounding Frank for a box of my own, 
and  
&gt; later to buy a minibox from Rick, since poor Frank was beset on 
all  
&gt; sides. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; We&#x27;ve already had some spectacularly burning arguments about what  
&gt; Chris claims his guides or technicians tell him behind closed 
doors.  
&gt; As far as I know, no audio of this is public, so his claims can&#x27;t 
be  
&gt; evaluated. I think the proliferation of people getting results 
with  
&gt; the boxes belies his assertion that only 30 are chosen.

&gt; &gt; I think some of you were discussing this recently, but I&#x27;m 
wondering
&gt; &gt; what you all think. I&#x27;ve watched/listened to this video a number 
of
&gt; &gt; times and can&#x27;t figure out if the participants are actually 
hearing
&gt; &gt; responses on their own or are totally relying on Chris to 
interpret  
&gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt; them what is being said. I&#x27;m disappointed because I honestly can&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; hear the words he&#x27;s repeating as being from spirit.
