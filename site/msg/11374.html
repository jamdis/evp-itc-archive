Yes. People have captured EVPs on all kinds of recorders.

No. In fact - that's what most of the early researchers did anyway. As 
far as my research has shown - the first time a recorder was used in an 
alleged haunted location was in 1971 (the first EVP on a magnetic 
recording was by Fathers Gemelli and Ernetti back in 1952 with the 
first organized EVP research performed by Attila Von Szalay and Raymond 
Bayless in 1956...several years before Friedrich Jurgenson started his 
experiments).
