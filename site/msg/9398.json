The focus will be\non users who&#39;ve had or who are interested in sharing paranormal and\nextraterrestrial experiences. The new social network may also have\noriginal video content investigating alleged ghost and UFO stories.\n\nSpielberg has always had a love for ghost and UFO stories. His movies\ninclude Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Poltergeist (1982),\nE.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Casper (1995), Men in Black\n(1997), The Haunting (1999), War of the Worlds (2005) and the upcoming\nInterstellar (2009). His first movie, at 16, was a 140-minute science\nfiction adventure called Firelight (which later inspired Close\nEncounters). Add to those titles a score of other sci-fi movies.\n\nSpielberg has apparently had at least one paranormal experience\nhimself. There are stories of him staying in a hotel called Excelsior\nHouse and being so frightened by ghosts that he fled the room and\nmoved 20 miles away. We&#39;ve also heard anecdotes about Spielberg seeing\nthe ghost of a dead relative repeatedly as a child. Whether based in\nreality or the product of an exceptional imagination, these\nexperiences may have had an impact on his life&#39;s work and this\nupcoming social network.\n\nThe project may have originally been associated with Yahoo but the\nproject was killed off before launch. But if our sources are right,\nthe idea has lived on and a team in Los Angeles is working to launch\nit in the next few months."}
