<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all,

 Ralph here again. Seems every time I come back on to leave a message
there&#x27;s some bickering going on. I can&#x27;t leave you people for a minute 
without some hoopla going on LOL (just Kidding). Well how ya&#x27;ll doing ?
Fine I hope. I have been busy with my Paranormal Group and 
investigations and Gettysburg. I was in Gettysburg over this past 
weekend and got an EVP in the Triagular Field that said &quot; Never trust 
Abe Lincoln &quot; LOL must have been a Rebel soldier. I thought that was 
pretty cool. I also got a voice whispering &quot; Good Day &quot; while I was 
leaving the field. I haven&#x27;t had any time to do any box research but I 
just recieved a cool device created by Bill Chappel called the &quot; 
Paranormal Puck &quot; can&#x27;t wait to use it. It does real time voice 
communication with phonetic speech and texting on the computer from 
taking the surrounding ambient energies to create speech from the 
atmosphere through the Paranormal puck that has eight sensors that 
gathers the data and converts it to speech. I think that is an accurate
description of it. 

Hey does anyone know what happened to Mike Colleta ? I haven&#x27;t heard 
anything from him for awhile. He hasn&#x27;t updated his website and his 
Blogtalk radio show has not been on lately either. I haven&#x27;t seen any 
posts on here either. So what&#x27;s up with Mike I hope he&#x27;s alright ? Just
concerned I really liked his Blogtalk shows. 

Frank Sumption please don&#x27;t let all of this bickering bother you. Your 
a better person than that. Keep up what your doing. I look forward to 
hearing what you have to say about your work and appreciate it also. 
Ignor all the hoopla and just give us all your knowledge and thoughts 
on what you love to do best and that&#x27;s good enough for me and all 
others on here that think your the best at what you do. We support you.
I wish I was as one tenth as smart as you, I would be making all kinds 
of gadgets believe me. I&#x27;m just a high school drop out with a GD from 
the Military working in a Post office ( making some good money though 
better than some College Grads) glad to say. I do have a ton of Ghost 
Hunting gadgets also LOL. My group calls me &quot; Inspector Gadget &quot; LOL.
So Frank your the reason alot of us have joined this group. So don&#x27;t 
be upset if some of the people get caught up in their own selves. Most 
of us want you here probably all of us do. It&#x27;s your choice what you 
do. I can&#x27;t persuade you to stay. It won&#x27;t be the same if you leave, 
your knowledge and you will be missed. I know I&#x27;ll miss ya. Even 
though I am not here all the time I am in the background watching and 
reading all the posts. Enough of my meandering gibberish. You all take 
care and I &#x27;ll let you know how the &quot;Paranormal Puck&quot; works out. 
Thanks for putting up with my long post here. Take care all.

Regards,

Ralph the Ghost Hunter
