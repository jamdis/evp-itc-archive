&gt; No, the settings on your membership.  I believe his personal setting is set for (no e-mail) notifications from the group.  Which means that if he wants to read the group he has to come to yahoo to read it, he currently does not get the group posts by way of e-mail.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think the only one that can answer that is frank, but i think his group e-mail is off.  If i speak with him, i&#x27;ll let him know about your question.
