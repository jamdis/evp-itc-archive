Close, but no audio.

I did get the radio to sweep the bands without stopp=
ing yesterday, but
there was no audio. Now if I can only duplicate that aga=
in... this time
with audio.

I was able to get the wire bundle connecting t=
he two ends of the circuit
board connector done this morning. And the radio=
 still works just like
when it was still all together.

What I've done is a=
dd a series of wires so I can access the underside of
the circuit board con=
taining the two ICs I want to manipulate. This wire
bundle is soldered to o=
n connector and plugged into the other. It allows
the radios circuit boards=
 to remain electrically connected.

I took a video to show it still functio=
ns like right-out-of-the-box...
but for how long...??

Working with no sche=
matic is really a challenge...  I'm afraid I may fry
the radio with one wro=
ng probe.

There's a few pics of the wire bundle and circuit boards on my b=
log, at:
