I should probably relax \nand not try so hard, but...\n\nI am curious as to if any one has any special practices or tricks with \nthis method that produces great results for them I eventually want to \nmake a speakjet box (or more accurately beg my more electronically \nastute friends to build me one).\n\nI have been really enjoying the 469 shack hack method, and of the only \ntwo sessions I have done, one was uncannily accurate, while the other, \nwell it was good experience :D\n\nThanks in advance for the info...\n\nAndy"}
