Gets weirder. Even stranger none of the police scanner code=

hey do things just not sure if thats one of them.

I guess police still use those =
codes. Emergency agencies such as ESDA now follow the FEMA Incident Command=
 System/National Incident Management System=C2=A0which requires all=C2=A0co=
mmunications to be in plain English (no codes).
