Ann,

Don't worry about it girl. I don't fight online anymore. I was set back a little that I was singled out for agreeing with Sumption instead of the issue being taken up with Sumption. LOL If someone don't understand my view point I am glad to explain. My research is hardly affected by any conflicts that may arise on this or any other forum and my friends on the other side have told me to lighten up a bit and to be patient so I try. The other members of the small circle to which I belong can attest to that. LOL 

Please don't feel that anything you may wonder or have questions about is the cause of conflict. Keep asking them! Just don't rely on one answer.

Best Regards,

Frank R.

Bruce, Frank R., since I feel like this all got started somehow

because of me, let me just say that I think a lot of what we were

collectively arguing about may be semantics. We're all agreed about

pursuing this research in a positive frame of mind. If you have a

naturally positive one, or if you need to do something ritualistic to

remind yourself that you are in a positive mindset, it really doesn't

matter. The same end is obtained.We' re all okay, no matter which way

we get to the positive vibe. As John Lennon said, "Whatever gets you

through the night, its alright."



You're both splendid researchers and you are both right, HMO.



Ann

people who consider themselves to be advanced researchers in ITC

telling others that there are things you need protection from in this

field. I have seen this fear mongering over the many years I have been

involved with my research and the research of colleagues and

associates and it has never helped anyone. Are there negative entities

out there that want to influence you and distract you? Sure there are!

Probably just as many who want to help you and they have been there

since the beginning of each of our lives.

that the more I learn and experience the more I realize I have a lot

to learn. Ego you say, not at all.
