They are always around us, it has nothing to do with me pressing any buttons or turning anything on, they are just around.. all the time... and there are ways of making speech audible so its heard by those who cant hear them without use of tools. One of my early messages was &quot;we&#39;re always with you wherever you are&quot;\n   \n  They do often talk of a gate/window/door/tunnel/bridge that opens, terminology varies. They have spoken of ushering some thru the gate, or making use of a window of opportunity to open up communication with us or with each other.\n   \n  Maybe they just werent done talkin or had more to say. So many here have had instances where they make use of other ways to get in touch, leaving messages on our answering machines or apports being found in strange locations. Radios turning on just in time to play a meaningful song. Images on televisions. Little messages just to let us know they are around. Often they pass messages thru other researchers they know you will communicate with or are already talking with.\n   \n  It&#39;s all very interesting but one thing they have always been very adamant about is to have no fear, it only attracts unwanted energies and if theres a button they can press they will press it. If you have no fear then they have no power to scare you. For those who are afraid or looking into it because its &quot;spooky&quot; perhaps this work isnt for you.\n   \n  I find negative personalities exist here as much as anywhere. I do what I can to block/neutralize my interaction with them on this side and the group does what it can to block interaction with them on thier end. Most who have been at this a while have found they have repeat visitors coming thru as well as the multitude of strangers popping up to say hello or yell something out.
