  Hi, Just uploaded one of my new=
est "evp" tonight. A little girl gives me a DATE of the year that is import=
ant to her. She says "1927" You will need headphones here people. I enhance=
d.....mainly so you can begin to hear where she will begin to speak. Is not=
 much improvement over the original audio, but serves as a "marker" notific=
ation when the background audio gets quiter. She sounds so sweet :) I hope =
we become friends. The file is in my folder "Jim's RR-DR60 EVP's" the audio=
 is called "important_date_enhanced_evp". The reason I asked for an importa=
nt date is so I could PROVE that I wasn't just getting some random interfer=
ance, or a "natural" spectral recording (the recordings left around locatio=
ns associated with intense emotions) I wish I had a way of doing these conv=
ersations LIVE. Well at least close enough that they wouldn't get bored wai=
ting for me to answer back. This is frustrating :) Don't want to just rambl=
e on here folks. But this is just awsome!!
