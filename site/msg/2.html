<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Amy;

 Looks like you made it. I&#x27;m goin got try not to control too much 
here, hopefully spammers won&#x27;t be too much of a problem, and there&#x27;s 
always the banned button! 

 For everyone joining; Welcome to my group, an informal place to 
discuss EVP and related subjects. I do my e-mail from work, 
hopefully my boss won&#x27;t see this! So mostly I&#x27;m here during the  
week day, and as time permits.

 There is a file area where members can upload voice examples, and 
even photos, just keep in mind that storage space is limited, so 
don&#x27;t leave stuff up on a permenant basis, and make sure you create 
your own folder, it makes it easier to keep track of your own stuff.

 Thanks!

 Frank</pre>
