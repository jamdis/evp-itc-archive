&gt;him. Winston just popped into my head, and out my my mouth, and it stuck.

&gt;batch

&gt;stuff
&gt; &gt;that makes me say to myself, wait a minute, maybe there&#x27;s nothing to this
&gt; &gt;stuff, it&#x27;s all percption. I think it&#x27;s important to question all the
&gt; &gt;&quot;truths&quot;, all the time. BTW, Winston is our newest Yorkie, weighing in at 
&gt;a
&gt; &gt;whopping 2.5 pounds! Not a small dog, a tiny dog! Like a Pixie dog!?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I know there&#x27;s somethig to the voices, but it&#x27;s hard to prove something, 
&gt;or
&gt; &gt;even demonstrate it if it&#x27;s highly, highly, highly, highly, highly,
&gt; &gt;highly---subjective, and personal?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Oh yeah, another first, I never got my son through the box, I had a voice 
&gt;I
&gt; &gt;found last night &quot;Frankie------I&#x27;m here&quot;, and at least it sounded real.
