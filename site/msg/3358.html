<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>S- I&#x27;ll pass by some of the other Shack&#x27;s not far from here. I&#x27;ll look
for the grey 12-470. -B

&gt; Bill,
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, it was from a old style 470 i was able get my hands on.  A 
&gt; floor model was all that was available at my local radio shack.  I 
&gt; was getting a pretty crappy AM signal because of the rain, but it 
&gt; works.  I try to leave the files barely touched to leave the 
&gt; authentic value for listeners.  I can get plenty 469&#x27;s, i can always 
&gt; pick one up and send it to you.  The original files from saturday 
&gt; were from the FM from the 469, that mod took less than 5 minutes to 
&gt; do.  The 470 old style is probably your best bet if you can find it 
&gt; because it has the built in speaker, but it&#x27;s really hard to find.  
&gt; It&#x27;s not the black one, it&#x27;s grey.

&gt; &gt; These are very clean. Are these from the HackShack radios? -Bill
&gt; &gt; My local Radio Shack doesn&#x27;t have the 469 or 470.
