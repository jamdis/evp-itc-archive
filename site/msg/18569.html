<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just try listening to the gibberish for awhile, see if sense emerges from
the chaos. When I tried my frist linear sweep system all I heard was
gibberish, then all the sudden I could hear them. I think the problem is all
you.

&gt;   Since all I hear is gibberish, and since interpreting such gibberish is
&gt; subjective, and can be influenced by telling people what they are supposed
&gt; to hear first, I would agree this kind of test is poor evidence.

&gt;  Nope, no evidencee, totally insignificant that a ghost box says &quot;ghost
&gt; box&quot;, must be anecdotal imaginary hallucinations caused by supplying oxygen
&gt; to a living brain stem. It must only count as evidence if the researcher has
&gt; multiple degrees in BSology--and I smile as I type that!
