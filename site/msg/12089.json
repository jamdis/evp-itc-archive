The skeptical side was expecting vague highly \ninterpreted responses. Doing a followup tonight. Question though, to \nother users of the 469, do you prefer am band (got best results with \nam) or fm band? I know that nighttime am reception is much better, so \nit seems logical to stick with that during nighttime hours. Any \nthoughts?\n\nthanks again\nAndy"}
