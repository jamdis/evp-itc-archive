LOL too big to post in files section you should get an esnips.com account o=
r something. It's free and allowd you to upload and share up to 50 gigs of =
stuff. I use it to save things I wish to share because this group has very =
limited storage space. Only 100 megs split between over 500 people doesnt g=
o far so I post most things there.
