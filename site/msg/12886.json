I think its\n&gt; the same spirit that have insulted me, its a woman, don&#39;t know who she\n&gt; was or is, but she had handled to get in to insult me. Do I have to\n&gt; tell her to go away and leave me alone ? or do I have to insult her\n&gt; back ?\n&gt;\n&gt; any ideas ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Neli\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt; Checked by AVG - http://www.avg.com \n&gt; Version: 8.0.175 / Virus Database: 270.9.9/1805 - Release Date: 11/22/2008 10:34 AM\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
