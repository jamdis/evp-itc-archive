What do the guys use that make the minibox's? There has got to be s=
ome
kind of
tuner that would work well and is very available.....Less noisy=
 would
definately be a plus.
I am so excited that there will be cheap FBs  =
SOON.... You just made my
day.
Are the cheap FBs going to debut at the Quee=
n Mary in Sept?
I will have to sign up........ Who knows, you might even ge=
t to slap
somebody.
Wouldn't want to miss that...... LOL

	Hi Susan. I don't know what kind of box you'll end up with, but
i=
n the meantime, you can always do "manual radio sweep." I get some of
my be=
st results that way. When I started doing sweep for EVP,
commercially avail=
able boxes were not available. My favorite unit so far
is the Duracell KP02=
8 crank flashlight/radio. It might be listed as the
"3 in 1" or something l=
ike that. The knob is just the right size and
tightness to make it easy to =
sweep from one end to the other. Of course,
it's a little obnoxious to have=
 to stop and crank it up every few
minutes, but I think the results make it=
 well worth the effort. I've
seen others have good success with all kinds o=
f different radios though.
So many makes/models can work well.
	
	I own the=
 Paranormal Systems units and many of the Radio Shack
hacks, and by compari=
son, this little $20 model really holds it's own.
PLUS it would be handy in=
 case of power outage. I think it's always
great to have items around the h=
ouse that can fulfill more than one
purpose. And so budget friendly too. ;-=
)
	
	Just a thought.....
