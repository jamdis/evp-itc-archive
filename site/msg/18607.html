BTW, if anyone is wondering what I am talking about, this was a good exampl=
e.
I offer a suggestion on getting things back on track with less hostility=
, and I am immediately attacked for making the suggestion.

I expect none of us like =
all the recent attacks, insults, accusations, 
threats, hurting of feelings=
, and attempts to piss people off. 

Can I 
suggest we stick to the purpose=
 of the group: "the discussion, promotion, and 
developemnt of Electronic V=
oice Phenomenon, and Instrumental Transcommunication 
methods and technolog=
ies as used in the communication with spirit, and other 
entities."

And th=
at we go with Frank's philosophy "just take the 
approach, try different me=
thods, see what works."

No more threats. No 
name calling, insults, or acc=
usations. Just try to keep a positive group 
attitude, be open that not eve=
ryone believes what everyone else does, and that's 
ok?
