I know it has a wire bundle of some \n&gt; sort inside, but I returned the one I had mistakenly opened up \nearly \n&gt; on.Anyone else tried to mod it?LC \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; The best games are on Xbox 360.
