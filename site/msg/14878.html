With the RS hacks they are basically just opening the case carefully and cu=
tting the mute wire or pulling out the mute pin depending which=A0radio it =
is. Check the archives for descriptions for each model. RS updated some ver=
sions of the radios so they were no longer able to be modified. Steve Hulta=

ou can also do a manual sweep with a radio that has a knob/dial or a scan f=
unction that doesnt jump the stations too quickly by simply scanning across=
 the band. This method works great.
