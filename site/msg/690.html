<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think very many get the idea the paranormal is all about haunted houses, 
with the focus being on ghosts, demons, and rotting flesh. Just to be clear, 
I don&#x27;t do &quot;investigations&quot;, nor do I believe in that stuff.  I do all my 
work from my basement. I think the only purpose of EVP is to prove to 
oneself that life is forever. I find these &quot;investigation&quot; sites with all 
the ghastly images of demons, skeletons, and ghosts an abomination, and very 
mis-leading to anyone that has any interset in non physical research. It&#x27;s a 
focus on the frightenning for the purpose of giving cheap thrills or making 
a quick buck.

I&#x27;m getting &quot;requests&quot; for my systems from these investigator types for my 
boxes. I would prefer that my stuff not be used for these negative purposes, 
for which is is not designed, nor intended. It&#x27;s intended to be used as a 
home type reciever system for contact with spirits and other enities, not 
for the rather dubious activity of &quot;ghost investigations&quot;.

Frank
