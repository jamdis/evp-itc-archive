<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>As I said, we really don&#x27;t know a lot about this field (no pun intended - 
or was it?)  Who has actually tried receiving some sort of radio/audio in 
a Faraday cage?  If it has been tried to any great extent without any 
success, I wouldn&#x27;t bother. But if no one has tried it yet, theories 
pro or con don&#x27;t mean much.

If someone tries it and doesn&#x27;t get anything, al that means is that 
&quot;whoever&quot; didn&#x27;t want to bother with that particular experiment.  And 
if some tries it and does get results, it means &quot;whoever&quot; did want to play 
along. I wouldn&#x27;t say lack of results proves or disproves the existence of 
spirits any more than absence of apparitions in my living room does.

You&#x27;ll still get white noise from the electronics itself in a Faraday 
cage.

The photographer and educator Fresd Picker used to have a big rubber 
stamp.  Someone would send him a letter asking if this or that would work. 
He would just use his big rubber stamp &quot;TRY IT!&quot; and then sign &quot;Sincerely, 
Fred Picker&quot; and mail it back to you. So that&#x27;s my advice too, if you&#x27;re 
so inclined.

&gt; The key to spirit communcation is to provide a raw audio, which

&gt; cage, block all raw audio out, and when you get no voices/evp, you can
&gt; proclaim there is no evidence for spirit! Same old &quot;scientific&quot; crap.
&gt; Whatever you do, don&#x27;t ask anyone that&#x27;s been doing this work for
&gt; close to ten years, in my case, and close to 30 years for the inventor
&gt; of EVPmaker, god forbid you should ask any real experts. Oh, yeah,
&gt; titles and degrees mean y&#x27;all already know everything knowable!
