<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You could also useing a radio transmitter instead of a motor. Electro magnetic fields radiate off of transmitters and are converted back to electric current when they reach conductive material, like a reciever or emf detector.

&gt; I have heard of a few groups using emf pumps or wells.   While doing some research I came across a very bad schematic of one, that the originator even admitted didn&#x27;t work.   I was wondering if anybody had built one or even knew where I could get the drawings for one?   I thought about using a fan motor out of a small fan, but I want something with a little more control.  I&#x27;m almost thinking of using the motors and such from a microwave.   They would give off very high emf readings, just not sure how to do it...yet.   Thanks in advance!!!
