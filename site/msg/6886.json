Wait until your in the store and can hear the \npeoples conversation 2 isles over, mixed in the the rest of the \npeople.  Its a constant scan over and over again!  I feel like one of \nthose nosey neighbors hearing things I shouldn&#39;t, LOL.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I already own a straight jacket, so I guess I&#39;m set!\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Juli\n&gt; \n&gt; ecuyler &lt;ecuyler@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           I have a question for those of you who have been doing \nthis research\n&gt; for a while. Since doing the research, have you noticed an increase\n&gt; in your &quot;intuitive&quot; senses? By that I mean, has your hearing been\n&gt; heightened to the point of hearing conversations when you are \nalone? \n&gt; Or seeing things more clearly spirit wise? Or am I just nuts and \nneed\n&gt; to be committed? \n&gt; \n&gt; I had to ask. It&#39;s a very strange thing. These things have been\n&gt; happening to me and I&#39;m wondering if you have experienced the same\n&gt; thing or close to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                          \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private & \nconfidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is \naddressed to.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;   No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or \nforwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.\n&gt;"}
