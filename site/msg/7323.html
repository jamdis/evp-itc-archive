<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Don&#x27;t know if anyone caught it, but Frank&#x27;s box was used on last
night&#x27;s episode of Paranormal State on A&amp;E.  They were investigating
an old insane asylum, and they had Chris Moon as a guest investigator
with the box.  You can see the promo clip here:

Here&#x27;s the site for the show itself:

For those not familiar, its a half hour show that follows along the
&quot;Penn State Paranormal Research Society&quot; and different cases they take
on.  Their niche in the &quot;paranormal reality tv show&quot; market is that
the group&#x27;s leader follows a more Christian orientated skew on
happenings.  Lots of &quot;demons&quot; (they have Lorraine Warren guest all the
time), and they usually try to do investigations/communication only
during what they call &quot;dead time&quot;, 3am-4am, or &quot;the polar opposite of
3pm - the time Jesus gave is life for all mankind&quot; as they put it. Oh,
and they have an &quot;occult specialist&quot; on the team that so far has been
anything but.

On the positive side, they did actually get (and record for later
analysis) live communication on the box in response to questions being
asked.  And on the analysis and isolation of the recorded parts, you
could actually hear what was being said (as opposed to the usual of
Chris acting as a go-between for very distorted sounds like on those
youtube videos).  So it was good to see it a)working in the &quot;field&quot;
and b)get some exposure on a tv show.
