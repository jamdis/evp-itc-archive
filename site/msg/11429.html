<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Arrius,

Here is a link to my site where i have some of frank&#x27;s schematics:

http://www.keyportparanormal.com/ghostboxschematics.html

As for circuitry of the boxes, i have to hand that back over to frank 
for that kind of info.  I have used an older radio for a manual sweping 
method that is made up of tubes and it gives it a nice sound different 
than a transistor radio.

&gt;  I am in search of a few answers pertaining to Franks Box. Can anyone 
&gt; direct me to a schematic inclusive of instructions as to the design 
of 
&gt; a Franks Box. Secondly I as to the am band units, can they only be 
&gt; devised and constrcuted with transistor circuits only or can the 
&gt; technique be applied to older tube sets as well?? I ask only because 
I 
&gt; would like to test some theories and thoughts. My sincere thanks to 
all 
&gt; for your time and replies.
