I&#39;m having a vision that making another purchase at Radio \nShack is in my near future.  ROFLOL.  \n\nLooking forward to hearing some 820 examples once they start coming through for you.\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Margaret \n&gt; \n&gt; The diffence between the 12-820 and new 12-469 is amazing. There is \n&gt; no clicking what so ever on either band. The Am band is so quiet I \n&gt; had to look at the radio to make sure it was still sweeping! I tried \n&gt; it out this morning for a bit but didnt get anything. I hope they \n&gt; like the new radio.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kay\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the update, Kay.  I&#39;ve also noticed varying sweep times \n&gt; between AM & FM on other \n&gt; &gt; models.  Not sure if the actual rate of sweep differs, for just \n&gt; the amount of channels there is \n&gt; &gt; to be swept on one band versus another, so it takes longer to \n&gt; complete one full cycle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
