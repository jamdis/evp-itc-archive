Maybe you heard something else.  I think \nthere are like 13 mp3&#39;s i posted.  Oak7 mp3 is kinda creepy because \nit doesn&#39;t use the radio.  It actually sounds like a real EVP saying \nPhilip.  Really clear and doesn&#39;t sound like it came from the radio \nand by the way i was alone and all the samples are as they were.  I \ndidn&#39;t slow or speed them up or enhance them to make them clearer.\n\nThanx,\n-Steve\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Steve, Very nice feature that you can adjust the speed of the \nsweep. \n&gt; I look forward to hearing more about your work. - Bill\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;urkel232002&quot; &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is just a really fast generated FM sweep which is automatic \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; just goes up and down the band.  My friend has been working on \n&gt; these \n&gt; &gt; for me and i&#39;m trying them out and starting to get results.  It \n&gt; &gt; really takes an aquired ear to catch it real time though, better \n&gt; &gt; success playing it back later.  I can slow the randomness down, \nbut \n&gt; &gt; than people will just say it was a radio station.  I&#39;m sure \n&gt; everyone \n&gt; &gt; knows how that goes.  I feel if it&#39;s really fast like i&#39;ve done \nit, \n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s really not on a station long enough to get a sentence \n&gt; &gt; out...Right???\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;urkel232002&quot; &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Radio is automatic sweep.
