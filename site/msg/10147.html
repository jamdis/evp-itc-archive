<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi All;

 This is why I say don&#x27;t get so tied up asking questions and trying to 
get that one profound answer while missing all the real stuff. In the 
file I have in my folder of the 30 second test of #36, the very first 
voice is &quot;Thomas Edison(sung)--I Never Visited Frank&quot;, I did not hear 
this until the third time I listened to the entire session. I&#x27;m not so 
intent on runing session after session all friggin&#x27; day that I don&#x27;t 
have/take time to listen. If I was trying to hear this stuff direct, I 
would miss it, and simialr voices about 99% of the time. That&#x27;s why, 
forget the damn questions, and just listen--over and over till you 
think you&#x27;ve gotten it all. Even my dad, and son come through in their 
own time, I don&#x27;t costantly ask for them. I swear to God, they know who 
is listening, when you are listening/recording, and what you need to 
know! Trust it!

 I know, the idiot scientist type will insist you have to ask 
questions, and confirm the answers, but that is BS, and results little 
useful information. Useful, as in has personal signifgance.
