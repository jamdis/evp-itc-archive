Well it could be multiple spirits or just one spirit using different fragme=
nts of speech making you think there are multiple entities.

Or it could be=
 multiple entities like in the movie Ghost when Whoopie Goldberg was doing =
a reading with Orlando's wife to get messages from Orlando, and she was sur=
rounded by multiple entities talking at the same time.

I do a lot of recor=
dings for clients, and I=C2=A0have gotten multiple voices in just about eve=
ry recording, and often times get lets say a five word sentence with each w=
ord a different sounding voice.

First time clients expect to hear the voic=
e of their loved one exactly as when they were alive, but that rarely occur=
s, and in truth almost never.

When I record with my dad, I get male, femal=
e, young, old, animated, peter framption messages in music from him, and he=
 talks in these many different voices about my family mentioning their firs=
t names in discussion. 

I still do not=C2=A0understand how those messages =
magically appear, or even if they are from one entity or many others having=
 side conversations while I record with one=C2=A0deceased client.

Heck the=
 dead for all we know, while they talk to us, some guide could be typing wh=
at they said into a etherical machine that projects the words into the nois=
e of the radio scanning for our recorders to pick up.

Before I start a ses=
sion, I always ask if there are other entities present that they please do =
not speak or even have a side conversation while they watch as their conver=
sation can get picked up on my recorder in addition to the client entity I =
am recording with.

I guess when I did, I will find the answer to that ques=
tion.

=C2=A0 
Frank,

I list=
ened closely to the clips and I found only one to contain continuous conver=
sation between voices. I am continually amazed that you receive multiple vo=
ices in conversation. It never seems to be just one person speaking in your=
 clips (from the ones I've heard anyway). 

There are typically two or more=
 voices in conversation with one another, which, as you know, should not be=
 possible because of the rapid switching of frequencies. But yet, these voi=
ces carry over all the switching. That should be proof enough for people.

=
By any chance do you know the amount of time your box stays on one frequenc=
y before switching? Is this time different between random and sweep?

Anywa=
y, to my ears, the best clip of these was the one labeled 0609101820. The v=
oices in this clip were quite clear.

@.01: Go Back (male)
@.02: It's prett=
y cool (same male voice)
@.04: Awesome (female)
@.06: Hello (different fema=
le)
@.08: Help me (electronic)
@.09: Hi (same female as before)
@.10: Help =
me Help me (same electronic)
@.12: Help me (same electronic)
@.13: Help me =
(same electronic)
@.14: Help me (same electronic)

Clip 0609102333 had few =
clear words to be analyzed:

@.02: Hello (male)
@.03: Who has (?pulled cent=
er?) (female)
@.06: Whatever (same female)

The 0609101257 clip (the one wi=
th the scope) was odd. There are vocal characteristics present such as pitc=
h and timbre, there are times when it even sounds syllabled, but it does no=
t sound like English to me. Could this be one of your ET clips?
