Hello all,
      I know I do not post much here, so let me start.  Going along these lines of thought, if you are recording the questions onto an audio tape and leaving 20 seconds of silence between them, you are still recording you and possibly your thoughts as well as any spirits that might be around you or your recording environment at that time.  So how do you know that what you listen back on is from the location you placed the recorder in and not from the location you recorded the questions in or from your own creation?  Just something to think about.

  I believe many evp's are deceased spirits, but the question on whether it could be a living person imprinting the evps was certainly one that made me really think !

          Hi James,

Back when I still investigated haunted sites, our team did this on various occasions within a house where we recorded several hours of activity over a few years (a long term investigation). We would leave our audio equipment recording in several "hot spots" all over the house and then leave for an hour or two. I have to say, in our experience we never got an EVP while we were out of the house. As a matter of fact we had an EVP when we reentered the house saying, "here they come, lets go". I don't necessarily understand why a ghost or spirit would talk with no one present to receive the message unless during setup you explained what you are trying to accomplish and what the spirits roll is in the experiment (we never tried explaining). A piece of machinery (recorders) in an empty room does not have a consciousness or spiritual presence I would be interested to see if you get different results.

Regards,

Frank

Subject: [EVP-ITC] EVP Experiment planned in October.

    To try and rule out that the EVP researchers are imprinting voices 
psychokinetically on audio players mistaken as ghosts voices, I will 
pre-tape an interactive evp session.

I will record a bank of thirty questions, 20 seconds of silence 
after each question, on a cassete tape and played on a cassette 
player that will be utilized in all three buildings in a known 
haunted location just outside of Phoenix, Arizona.

There will be digital recorders, cassette recorders, omni 
directional microphones, condensor microphones, as well as an 
electrocet boom microphone present in all of the sessions. There 
will be no human agents in the buildings when these sessions take 
place.

My hope is to:

Record an authentic EVP with no human agent in the building. 

If this is phenomena driven, will the phenomena communicate by 
responding to questions from a machine rather than a human agent? 

If you have any ideas to enhance this experiment, please feel free 
to let me know. This experiment will take place on October 27th. 

James
