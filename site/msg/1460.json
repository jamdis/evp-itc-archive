Those of\n&gt;us that believe in this ongoing project like to spend time not only\n&gt;keeping up with the development of the Box, but also listening\n&gt;closely to the output. A bar graph display is a nice addition. -Bill\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is the sweep board that goes with the newest tuner/audio\n&gt;board. I made\n&gt; &gt; one change not shown, I&#39;m using a bargraph display for the tuning\n&gt;voltage\n&gt; &gt; instead of a meter(I had one in the junk box). So for the\n&gt;newest &quot;proto\n&gt; &gt; type&quot; there is two schematics, sweep, and the tuner. This system is\n&gt;much\n&gt; &gt; more complicated than I would like, and it still makes it look like\n&gt;exotic\n&gt; &gt; technology, it is in fact, just a radio, and the tuning system.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was curious in setting up this latest sweep board, something\n&gt;changed, I no\n&gt; &gt; longer could use the pull down resistors to compensate for the DC\n&gt;offset\n&gt; &gt; from the op amps. I used only one pull down on the RVG pulse amp.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I used the tantalum capacitors in the white noise amp, the\n&gt;advantage being a\n&gt; &gt; faster start up time. Larger aluminum caps can be used, such as\n&gt;100uf-16volt\n&gt; &gt; caps. It takes about 20 seconds for the white noise to come up, and\n&gt;it still\n&gt; &gt; takes one minute before the VT signals comes on. On the other hand,\n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; linear sweep is on as soon as power is turned on, and with this\n&gt;sweep\n&gt; &gt; version, the triangle is on all the time, so modes can be switched\n&gt;wihtout\n&gt; &gt; the warm up period.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is how I spend my hoildays----but boring!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; FYI---- Mine!  I don&#39;t have a usable system to run sessions on, I\n&gt;keep\n&gt; &gt; giving them away! Besides, I&#39;d like to keep the first home made\n&gt;AM/FM tuner\n&gt; &gt; board.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; http://liveearth.msn.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nhttp://newlivehotmail.com"}
