I use crystals \nduring meditation and have had great results with spirit \ncommunication. I assume by adding the crystal to the Minibox it \nwould increase spirit communication giving the spirit another \nchannel to go though.\n\nKay\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; This is going to sound crazy, but I&#39;ll keep my clicking.  I don&#39;t \nhear it anymore during the session.  I just like an old person when \nthey get use to something, they will keep it.  Nothing new.  But I \nam in the market for a Mini Box with the crystal enhancer.  Does \nanybody know what the crystal enhance does?  I know that crystal \nhave energy, but what is the enhancer?\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Rees\n&gt; \n&gt;"}
