I&#39;m impressed by these clear and immediate\nanswers. I didn&#39;t expect that this simple method would work so well for\nsome experimenters.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Just a quick note to let y&#39;all know I&#39;ve replaced the files in my EVP Maker folder with four new \n&gt; ones from tonight.  I&#39;m very impressed with the responses/answers I am being given. \n\n&gt; I received a greeting, by name.  \n&gt; Confirmation when I asked if I&#39;d heard correctly.\n&gt; An object on my desk was correctly identified.\n&gt; An object in my left hand was correctly identified (with a unique interpretation of it!)\n\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Margaret%20Downey/SJ%20Allophones/\n\n&gt; I hope you can hear some of these.  I&#39;ve been working to gather examples which show \n&gt; relevance and intent of communication.  Arthur is on a roll.  LOL.  ;0)"}
