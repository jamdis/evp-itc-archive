<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Misty .. Thanks so much for listening!  I used my Son&#x27;s clock 
radio to record those .. turning the dial back and forth really fast 
while speaking and listening recording with DC6.  Many are using DC7 
now .. I haven&#x27;t tried DC7 yet but all you need to do is press 
the &quot;LIVE&quot; button and wear headphones and you will hear the played-
back version (1/4 second delay) and just keep listening and 
answering .  It took me a while to learn how to speak without hearing 
myself talk (because of the headphones) ... (You need headphones that 
cover your ear or ear buds so that the recorder doesn&#x27;t record itself 
playing back ..                     

I belive their are some free recording programs that play-back as 
you&#x27;re recording .. I&#x27;ll post them when I find them!

Debbie

&gt; Hiya Debbie. I finally got a chance to listen to your files today. 
&gt; Great stuff! I could hear that as you did. Perhaps you could do a 
post 
&gt; on your setup for the newbies who never heard of dc6 or the ways it 
can 
&gt; be used.
&gt;  
&gt; They came thru pretty darn loud and clear for that one!

&gt; &gt; I recorded this sweeping manually and listening via 
DC6 &quot;LIVE&quot; ... 
&gt; Hope 
&gt; &gt; you&#x27;re able to hear it ..
