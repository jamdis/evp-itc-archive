<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ok, listening to this again, I hear the question four times, 
who is this?
who&#x27;s this?
then the woman again very quickly
Who&#x27;s this?
Who is?

Faint, but there...

strange file... Do you think they ever repeat themselves on purpose just to make sure we get the communication?

&gt; can&#x27;t load the second one (will have to check my computer&#x27;s sound player), however the first file says the following:
&gt;  &quot;who is this?&quot; in a woman&#x27;s voice... 
&gt; then very quickly, &quot;who&#x27;s this?&quot; in a man&#x27;s voice
&gt; 
&gt;  did you catch both of them or just the second one, because it is there TWICE, not just once.

&gt; &gt; Maybe there is no difference? Of course just copying to the PC digitizes it.
