<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, I&#x27;ve noticed that when &quot;Steve&quot; is there, he starts saying his name the instant I turn on the recorder.  I guess it really would be a boring life if all you had to talk about or look forward to was when the cats were going to be fed!

&gt;  I don&#x27;t do alot of regular sessions, when I do a test recording they always start talking imediately, right when the recording starts, on video or just a voice recorder. They always act like they are right there--present. I can&#x27;t imagine entites just hanging out waiting.

&gt;  I think the mini box is just a TRF radio, except it&#x27;s step tuned in 10khz incrememnts. I don&#x27;t know why they didn&#x27;t install a decent amplifier in the thing.
