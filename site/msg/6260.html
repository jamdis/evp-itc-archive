<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You know, Frank, I seem somehow completely agree that I don&#x27;t give a  
darn who believes my personal research except me and needing proof.  
It&#x27;s a disconnect, I do admit it, but there it is. God knows, I am  
imperfect. But my affection for those on the Other Side is massive,  
and I do always promise that if I see the proof I need, I will change  
my mind and let everyone know I have. So, I am very glad to hear that  
Hans and Ernst, et al, are trying to get things online. I have always  
respected both to them to the maximum. I will keep my eyes peeled for  
their updated material. Nothing would make me happier than to be  
wrong in this case. Really.

Thanks for debating with me, my friend. :)

&gt; Don&#x27;t worry Ann, there is nothing wrong with being a skeptic. Just  
&gt; don&#x27;t fall into the category of close-minded skeptic, where you  
&gt; dismiss a claim for the sake of dismissing it and not because you  
&gt; have proof it is false. I don&#x27;t claim to be skeptical for reasons  
&gt; you will read below, although at one time I was....
&gt;
&gt; The message I posted from technician was a specific message by  
&gt; technician for the members of INIT. It was not a general message to  
&gt; the world. What it does a good job of is outlining their purpose  
&gt; and identifying obstacles. What a lot of people do not realize is  
&gt; that most of these messages you receive are not for anyone other  
&gt; that the one who receives them. They are personal! Mark and Rolf  
&gt; both shared a great deal of information with me as well as others.  
&gt; Mark has personally told me he don&#x27;t care who believes or doesn&#x27;t  
&gt; believe the things that happened then. Those experiences changed  
&gt; him for life and will always will be help by him as truth.
&gt;
&gt; At the present moment Rolf, Dr. Senkowski and Hans are translating  
&gt; Adolf Holmes journals and writings into English. They are being  
&gt; posted piece by piece on the World ITC website. You may have not  
&gt; noticed because the changes have not been announced but they have  
&gt; been posting them since last June.
&gt;
&gt; As for the validity of the events of the pioneers I have to give  
&gt; them credence just from my own experiences since I began. I have  
&gt; had many wonderful things happen while I have been experimenting  
&gt; with the many methods and aspects of ITC. These experiences have  
&gt; made me realize that those events that you and I have read about  
&gt; are not that outlandish and are absolutely possible.

&gt; &gt;&gt;It really surprises me how many new and old ITC &quot;researchers&quot; have
&gt; not gone through the old data and recordings. The pioneers of this
&gt; &quot;field&quot; took in tens of thousands of messages and recordings through
&gt; a wide range of media.&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; Yes, they may have done, but how much of that was ever made public?
&gt; Not very much. Even today. I have gone through what has been
&gt; released, about six times over. Mark has let more out than just about
&gt; anyone. The key players, Maggie and Jules, have made very little of
&gt; theirs available indeed. I&#x27;d love to see that change so that we can
&gt; better access what was going on.
&gt;
&gt; At the time INIT was together, I was rather desperately wanting and
&gt; asking for more information. When things began to be made public in
&gt; the United States, it was translated newsletters- -again anecdotal--no
&gt; attached files, obviously; photos that looked produced with 1980s
&gt; xerox technology (It *was* the 1980s, after all); a lot of second-
&gt; hand stories and a a few first-hand ones passed from person to person
&gt; via letters and telephone conversations. Later, there was audio from
&gt; researchers like Sarah who let her phone messages from Raudive be
&gt; made public. As I noted, I don&#x27;t have a problem with most of those.
&gt; Obviously, a voice was recorded on an answering machine and can still
&gt; be listened to today. I&#x27;d prefer to think that voice really is
&gt; Raudive, but remember that it was not EVP--it was real phone calls.
&gt;
&gt; When Macy wrote his book about it, Miracles in the Storm, I was
&gt; figuratively, if not literally, the the first person who bought it. I
&gt; thought, &quot;now I am finally going to find out what really happened and
&gt; be awed by the incredible evidence.&quot; Only Mark&#x27;s book offered none of
&gt; that for me. I was just looking at the customer reviews for the book
&gt; on Amazon, because I thought I had written a review of it there at
&gt; the time. I didn&#x27;t, but here is one from someone who pretty much sums
&gt; up what I think about it: &quot;Macy&#x27;s book focuses mainly on the
&gt; personality conflicts that undermined an attempt at high-tech
&gt; communications with the spirit world. His style is readable and
&gt; brisk, his tone sincere and unaffected, but he provides little or no
&gt; evidence that the phenomena he describes are authentic. The main
&gt; researchers he depicts come off more as enthusiastic dilettantes than
&gt; serious scientists. For me, Macy forfeits nearly all credibility when
&gt; he casually declares that the history of the human race can be
&gt; understood by integrating some of the spirit communications with the
&gt; writings of Erich von Daniken (p.140)! Von Daniken, of CHARIOTS OF
&gt; THE GODS fame, is an entirely discredited huckster. If Macy can be
&gt; persuaded by von Daniken&#x27;s pop-culture writings, he will probably
&gt; believe just about anything. There is an unfortunate messianic tone
&gt; pervading the book - the message that a new dawn of humanity is
&gt; coming, courtesy of the spirit communicators and the mortals who
&gt; spread their message. You&#x27;ll probably find MIRACLES IN THE STORM
&gt; enjoyable and easy to read (hence three stars), but it will convince
&gt; no one who isn&#x27;t already a believer.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I mentioned $cientology wryly, and I should have put in a ;) or
&gt; something--my bad--but I do stand by the similarity in message and
&gt; tone. I&#x27;m not conflating the two, I&#x27;m just pointing out what makes me
&gt; wary, and the sentence, &quot;our progress toward a free, wealthy and sane
&gt; future in which humanity would have stripped off the chains of
&gt; intolerance and cruelty&quot; is especially redolent.
&gt;
&gt; In short, while I do believe that we all need to evolve into more
&gt; loving and spiritual beings, and I have tried all my life to do so
&gt; with a few limited successes, I still find that becoming &quot;better&quot; is
&gt; not tantamount to becoming less critical or buying into every
&gt; messiah&#x27;s momentum. As I&#x27;ve said before, I want to believe, but I
&gt; will not believe only because I want to. And I&#x27;m not even saying that
&gt; the whole INIT thing was a fraud. It wasn&#x27;t. But I do think that
&gt; there are aspects of it that were, or that were highly inflated. And
&gt; we have to be honest about that or we can&#x27;t really be honest about
&gt; what is unshakable in paranormal research.
&gt;
&gt; And this is just my own opinion, and we know what opinions are like,
&gt; and perhaps I am one. But I hope you will humor me and keep me around
&gt; because even one of those has its uses. ;)
