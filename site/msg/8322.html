<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve,

I listened to your files and was able to hear most of them. Just one
comment: In the file &quot;yes--to_help_you.mp3&quot;, after your question &quot;Are
you able to use EVPmaker throgh this&quot;, I can hear: &quot;Yes, I help ... I
help you, check it out&quot;.

Stefan

&gt; I&#x27;ve personally never had succes until today with EvpMaker.  It seems 
&gt; like they&#x27;re talking loud and clear with that audio clip Stefan 
&gt; posted.  I am going to do another couple minute session later and see 
&gt; what i get, the answers i feel are pretty clear.  But, i would like to 
&gt; know if others are hearing them.  I suggest for people to experiment 
&gt; with this file through EvpMaker and see what you guys get.  I&#x27;m excited 
&gt; once again about the communication we are receiving.

&gt; Thanx Stefan,
&gt; -Steve H.</pre>
