<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Rosemary,

That you so much for your beautiful account of her services, and that 
amazing story of her start and works. Yes, we have much to thank her 
for, and I appreciate you taking the time to share this with us here.

(Note: I had to smile when I read about her sneaking peeks into 
caskets. I too grew up around such surroundings. My great uncle was a 
funeral director in Chicago, and I visited his home often. They lived 
upstairs and the funeral parlor and preparation area were on the 
first floor and basement.)

- Mike
