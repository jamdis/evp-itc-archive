frank you are right-on about the voltage.  any component used for spook 
come should have at least double the normal voltage rating; otherwise 
everything performs great first time out then quickly and steadily 
degrades.

oddly enough, the fogal transistor was partly a result of my comments to 
a mutual friend of myself and fogal in 1985

i had filed down 2n904 and other transistors and oxidized the exposed 
silicon with hydrogen peroxide, called it surface barrier-superior high 
voltage high freq performance, behaved like it had a built-in emitter 
bypass of large C value.

the tantalum thing is legit in quieting noise and may relate to a pseudo 
form of &quot;antigravity&quot; where even living things can be levitated by 
longitudinal pressure waves emanating from capacitabce made of material 
with nuclei that will align in a prescribed way.  this is not the frog 
levitating over the superconductor ---thats an unrelated phenom,.

tantalum and thulium and bismuth are three candidate substances for 
vogel capacitor. so far the only dielectric that will work is oversize 
and over thick mica plates.  some metal oxide will probly be the answer

think of a room temperature, near-superconductor and optical sensor.  
its along those lines.

the wavelength of the acoustic/electric wave has merely to match the 
long axis of the living thing (like ,say 5 to 6 feet for humans) to 
levitate it.  the chinese are amusing each other by buzzing small 
animals around right now
