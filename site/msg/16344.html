Frank's take is correct though I would like to add that the meters used in =
ghost hunting measure the magnetic field (gaussian field), which is perpend=
icular to the true magnetic field. There=C2=A0are no meters=C2=A0capable=C2=
=A0of=C2=A0directly measuring the magnetic lines of flux around a EM field.=
 If you look at the components of an EM field you have the frequency of the=
 wave (cycles per second), the intensity of the electric field (commonly sh=
own in watts but=C2=A0for ghost purposes in coulumbs (takes some conversion=
)), and the magnetic field, which is 90 degrees to the electric field=C2=A0=
(in milligauss or webers=C2=A0for ghost hunters (in Europe measured in Tesl=
a). The intensity or volume is usually figured as half the wavelength of th=
e frequency. It does not increase the rate of the frequency but will increa=
se the saturation of space. In other words the frequency stays the same but=
 the intensity can be boosted, which is the reason why some ghost hunters u=
se electrostatic
 field generators in supposed haunted areas in hope to boo=
st activity (yet to be seen if it works or not).
