It was a Ten-Tec RX-320 receiver, and it received LW/MW/SW in AM/CW/SSB. It was a fun little radio, but using the software to control it, there were so many  other options available. Nice bandscope with point-and-click tuning. Selectable user defined filters, you name it. Another neat feature was the fact there there were virtually dozens of third-party software releases for operating it, usually catering to the ham/swl crowd.\n\nMy thoughts are that perhaps a similar computer-controlled ghost box could be made. You could use the software to define sweep style, and it would be endless possibilities. You could have an RNG controlling the random sweep, and linear sweeps could be programmed to emulate triangle, sawtooth, ramp, etc...\n\nIn addition, you could have on-the-fly recording options, and you could apply various filters to clean it up. Visual waveform indicators, and file reverse option for reversing the file. Heck, you could even introduce your preference of noise source (white, pink, brown) into the signal. Perhaps an optional echo chamber with built in mic for output. All of these things could be software controlled, and I am not to sure they couldn&#39;t be implemented via software package for existing radios out there such as the ICOM PCR-1000 or the TEN-TEC Rx 320 or Pegasus.  Really all of these things are a result of the software interface, so it is completely possible, but it would have to be someone with a lot more tech experience than me to make it a reality. Any takers?\n\nthanks\nAndy"}
