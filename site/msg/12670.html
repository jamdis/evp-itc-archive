<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have most of their shows archived on my ipod. They really put
together an informative show, with regular live rtsc/itc sessions with
one of their 3 devices. Their devices, derivatives of Mike&#x27;s
spiricomp, are pretty cool, and their sessions are very cool to listen
to. Gotta say I am a fan of this show, and if you haven&#x27;t heard them
yet, I think you will like them. Of course I love the fact that they
are focused on itc/rtsc.

thanks
Andy
