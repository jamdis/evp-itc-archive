Dr. Sam El-Khaz=\r\nen recently published an article in the\n  Journal of Neuroquantology (study=\r\n of brain function at the quantum\n  mechanical level). In this paper entitl=\r\ned &quot;DNA The Gateway to\n  Time&quot;, El-Khazen talks about the relationship betw=\r\neen the structure\n  of DNA, time, conscious perception and gravity. There i=\r\ns credible\n  evidence that these are intimately correlated. \n\n  An importan=\r\nt finding for this group has to do with how we may in\n  fact detect externa=\r\nl influences in the physical world. If El-Khazen\n  has it right, two EM wav=\r\nes must align in order for the preception\n  process to even begin. If this =\r\ndoes not happen, there is nothing to\n  perceive, even though we may be impa=\r\ncted by an external potentially\n  influencing EM wave. The second wave is g=\r\nenerated from borrowed\n  energy within our brain cells and is modelled upon=\r\n the structure of\n  DNA strands. So yes we are impacted by billions of EM s=\r\nignals per\n  second but we actually detect only a small portion of these th=\r\nat we\n  later process in the late-stage perceptual processes. \n\n  This woul=\r\nd nicely explain why two people would perceive events\n  differently despite=\r\n the fact that they were literally side by side\n  witnessing the same event=\r\n. Again this is strictly a matter of\n  random probability, it seems to have=\r\n nothing whatsoever to do with\n  volition or intention. That is more the fo=\r\ncus of the later\n  perceptual processing which is in turn dependent upon th=\r\nis\n  probabilistic process.\n\n  This could also explain why it is that EVP a=\r\nnd ITC signals are\n  perceived differently by different people even when no=\r\n physical\n  alteration to the media has occurred and why different things a=\r\nre\n  heard more easily at different times by the same person.\n\n\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_0073_01C9D9F2.0A93A110\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18702&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;There is a movie called &quot;What the Bleep Do \nWe Know&quot; wh=\r\nich is along these lines.
