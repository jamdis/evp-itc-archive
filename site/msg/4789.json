I noticed that the flow is good on these, especially the one with Bruce being in doubt.  The communication is constantly flowing through, instead of waiting as if it was scaning  a station.\n   \n  Juli\n\nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n           These are direct from the system output speaker, the speaker that will provide the raw audio output for this box. There seems to be more static on the AM band tonight, part of that is cuz I think this board has more RF gain at the antenna then the previous board. It probably depends on the type of core I used for the coil, and since they are from the junk box, I have no idea what the permeability rating is for these cores. The core being a ferrite bobbin that I wind the coil on. \n \n Frank-S\n\n  \n---------------------------------\n  Share life as it happens with the new Windows Live.
