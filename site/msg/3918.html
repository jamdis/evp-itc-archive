<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Guys, I have just be wondering if anyone has tried experimenting with 
running session at the same time in different locations with the same 
boxes?

I was curious if in fact even though the frequencies would be different 
depending our your area, if in fact some of the same voices would come 
through to each of you.

It was just a thought?  In my testing sessions I am coming to find out 
that they certainly know all of you, Frank, Bruce, Mike, etc.. for your 
names seem to be coming up.  Therefore, I wonder if you all have so 
called &quot;personal assistants&quot; or &quot;tecs&quot; assiged to you or if they are 
random?</pre>
