I also have other boxes for sale:\n&gt; \n&gt; RS 12-587----$32 plus shipping-(Actual Cost of unit)\n&gt; \n&gt; MiniBox Plus----$400 plus shipping-(I paid $550 originally)\n&gt; \n&gt; Joe&#39;s Box----$150. 00-(I paid $250 originally)\n&gt; \n&gt; MiniBox 2----$150\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me know if anyone is interested in any or all of the boxes, i need to free\n&gt; up some space in my home and am offer them at a discounted rate. I rarely have\n&gt; time to use all of these, so they must go. I figured that i would offer the\n&gt; group first before putting them on Ebay.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
