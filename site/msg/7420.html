thanks Debbie, I try so hard to make contact or at least hope they will speak at somepoint to and I can record it!
   
  Everyday, is an adventure, kind a like "Cracker Jack"....you can't wait to get to play with the toy at the bottom!  The clips are that way to me.  Never knowing what I am going to get, but for the most part, I love the suprise!!!
