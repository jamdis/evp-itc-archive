If i got a full sentence that would be great, but it \nprobably wouldn&#39;t be clear enough to post on the board. If i have to \nexplain what it says to convince people to hear it, than it&#39; s \nprobably nothing. When in doubt, throw the file out. I try to form \nthe questions for the most part in Yes and No format, it seems they \ncan always respond with yes and no. I do get other stuff that is \ngood, but i try and keep it simple for them. And frank just sits \nback and listens without asking questions allowing them to get that \nmessage across. I prefer to ask questions, because i know when to \nwait for a response. The Skype session i had with my Joe&#39;s box last \nfriday with Juli and Joel was a great example of getting good \ncommunication. We were getting answers to all our questions and \nthat &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; file was one of the clearest i have ever heard \ncome through my Joe&#39;s Box #2, which is now broken again.
