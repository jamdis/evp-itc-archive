<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You know, now that I read your reply, it occurs to me that what I&#x27;m
really wondering about is that the spirit used the word &quot;grounded.&quot;
That&#x27;s our lingo--not what an average dead person would reply, I don&#x27;t
think. Had you mentioned the term aloud? I&#x27;m just curious about the
word choice. It strikes me more as a deliberate choice made by an
entity familiar with paranormal jargon.

Thoughts?

&gt; No context, I find that sometimes not often earthbound spirits will
&gt; be drawn to a live box session kind of like a moth is drawn to a light.
&gt;  
&gt; I believe the energy that flows back and forth between our world and the
&gt; spirit world is a strong attractant on both sides. So now and then
you will 
&gt; get a stray spirit on either side that will visit the area of the
session.
&gt;  
&gt; If they are on the other side they will piggy back the flowing
signal and deliver a random message or word.
&gt; If on this side they will use the boxes energy to place the message
directly onto the recorder. 
&gt; Hence the different sound of this message as apposed to a usual box
message.
