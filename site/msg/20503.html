Ques=
tion:

I don't hear most of the files you post, but  you hear them so clear=
ly. The 
only way to validate what you hear is  true, would be to follow up=
 with 
something that you got that actually  happened.

Have you ever heard=
 a message that came true that  nobody else heard, 
basically validating yo=
ur  experience?
