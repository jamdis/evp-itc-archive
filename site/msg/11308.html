&gt; Sorry to have been so out of the loop. I&#x27;ve had loads of articles  
&gt; due. Rosemary Guiley and I also almost died of heatstroke at a 
show  
&gt; we were both working last weekend. It was over 100 at 10 am. I 
told  
&gt; her I was sorry to meet her looking so disreputable, but  
&gt; circumstances were what they were... Anyway, Rosemary, let&#x27;s try 
to  
&gt; meet up in more civilized circs soon. :)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, Frank gifted me box 31 about a month and half ago, and it 
has  
&gt; only been this week that my son and I have been able to A.) Get 
all  
&gt; 18 batteries in the right direction without any falling out ;) , 
B.)  
&gt; Sit down and see if we could make the connection. Yesterday got it  
&gt; rolling, but first he had to turn on his RS hack and tell them 
about  
&gt; box 31 and that he wanted them to try it. He says almost 
immediately  
&gt; he began hearing Frank&#x27;s name and &quot;purple&quot; through 31.
&gt; 
&gt; Frank, I don&#x27;t know what you do, but I swear it&#x27;s like a baby 
taking  
&gt; its first breath or something--the &quot;reflex&quot; of the box seems to be 
to  
&gt; call for you. Even my mini did, remember?
&gt; 
&gt; So, we just did a session today. We didn&#x27;t record it, because we  
&gt; didn&#x27;t figure we&#x27;d get much and would fooling about with where to  
&gt; hang the antenna wire and all. But, sure enough, within minutes, 
we  
&gt; were getting responses to our simple questions, hearing the tech  
&gt; words I have become used to, such as &quot;check,&quot; the technician Stu 
said  
&gt; his name, someone called my name, and when I asked if we should 
sign  
&gt; off, someone clearly said, &quot;Yes.&quot; I said &quot;Thank you,&quot; and the  
&gt; immediate response was, &quot;You&#x27;re welcome.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; 31 is very different to my mini--I can see that already. Nick and 
I  
&gt; will keep you posted about our next round of contact.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ann
