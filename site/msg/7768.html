&gt;  I&#x27;ve heard if you like pretend to talk to then im your mind, and 
&gt; listen, and imagine them taling back, sometimes you actually get 
&gt; answers like that. I&#x27;ve done that with my dad, and there&#x27;s times I 
&gt; swear we are talking two way--kinda mediumistically. I don&#x27;t really 
&gt; hear the voice, but feel it, or feel the conversation.

&gt; &gt; Thanks Frank.....I didnt even think about it that way, they have 
&gt; some new things to learn before they can do that...kinda a duh 
moment 
&gt; for me there.  I guess I just miss her so much and have so much 
that 
&gt; went unsaid and unanswered on her part that I didnt even think 
about 
&gt; that. but I know ur right...learning new things takes time.

&gt; &gt; My sympathies! That story seems all too common in this society. 
It 
&gt; &gt; may take some time, first the spirit has to realize where they 
are, 
&gt; &gt; and then learn how to communicate. They seem to hear our 
thoughts, 
&gt; so 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m sure your mother knows what was going on and how you feel.

&gt; &gt; &gt; My mom just passed away on the 21st of Feb and I wasnt able to 
&gt; see 
&gt; &gt; her for the past year or so mostly due to the fact that my sister 
&gt; was 
&gt; &gt; selfish and wouldnt tell me what nursing home she put my mom in. 
&gt; She 
&gt; &gt; sold my mom&#x27;s house and property and gave her stuff to 
&gt; goodwill...and 
&gt; &gt; she had the nerve to tell me via informal and rather rude email 
&gt; that 
&gt; &gt; my mom passed and what a burden it was to her the past few months 
&gt; &gt; taking care of her. I know my mom knows that I loved her and will 
&gt; &gt; always...but I dont know if she knows what my sister did to keep 
me 
&gt; &gt; from her and I feel like a horrible daughter...not getting to see 
&gt; her 
&gt; &gt; before she passed. I finally got her address and phone number in 
a 
&gt; &gt; christmas card she sent me and I was able to call her for like 10 
&gt; &gt; mins before she had to go eat...and when I tried calling back 
that 
&gt; &gt; night and several times after I only got her machine. I wanted to 
&gt; go 
&gt; &gt; see her but didnt have a way to get all the way to where she 
&gt; &gt; was...not even the public buses run to
&gt; &gt; &gt; where the nursing home was.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ive tried doing some EVPs to see if there was a chance of 
&gt; &gt; contacting her...I know ya dont usully get what ur looking 
&gt; for...but 
&gt; &gt; Ive gotten nothing at all. So Im wondering....is there anyone who 
&gt; &gt; has done a skype session for this type of situation and gotten 
any 
&gt; &gt; success? And would you be willing to do a skype session with me?
&gt; (Tho 
&gt; &gt; I have no idea how that would even work, Id be willing to 
&gt; try...heck 
&gt; &gt; just to be able to listen to a session would be awesome) 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhonda
