From what I have heard of other people&#39;s cemetery EVPs, it sounds \n&gt; like a lot of cemeteries are populated with people who haven&#39;t made it over. \n&gt; I find cemetery EVP to be the most fascinating because they seem to offer a \n&gt; glimpse into a chaotic and not-so-pretty part of the After Life that very few \n&gt; are willing to look at. Our cemeteries seem to me to truly be cities of the \n&gt; dead.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;"}
