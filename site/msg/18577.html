I don't ignore any evidence: I classify it.=C2=A0 Telling someone what they=
 are supposed to hear in a bunch of noise, and then suggesting they keep li=
stening until they hear it, is not good evidence. Like even you said: "imag=

For me, the question is=
 not whether sense will emerge: it will. Just like when looking at the rand=
omness clouds eventually will emerge pictures.

For me, the question is whe=
re is that sense coming from: inside me, my brain? Or some entity? 


My pr=
oblem is that many of the results people post are ambiguous. While they cou=
ld be from spirits, I can not find anything about them that rules out just =
the operator's brain.

And so I try to listen to the specific claims people=
 make about the box and what it can reveal. And I try to construct my exper=
iments to see if I can rule out the brain, leaving the spirits.


Why is th=
at so awful?
