There is no reason to think anyone is being a hypocrite here. If this research has taught us anything it teaches us that changing what we believe and changes in our perspective are constant. The things we pretend we know are constantly challenged by the things we learn from the contacts we make. The more experience in ITC we have (positive or negative) the more it reinforces the acceptance of no fear.

Now with that being said, if Bruce and Steve want to take this conversation to the negative and make it an argument then do it in private email. It is not anyone else's business if you have a "bone to pick" with each other.

Regards,

Frank R.

Steve,

 

At the risk of starting a big critical string of posts

you forget that you and I experienced the negative side of this research

together and you even went as far as to do a cleansing ritual involving a medium.

 

And have told me on numerous occasions that you do a protection ritual before every session.

All I can say is that if you where not being truthful, that is why you experienced the negative 

incidents that plagued your home and your research. 

 

Please, and I'm asking nicely do not take the road of hypocrisy just to disagree with me.

It would not be fare to the new individuals that may trust your opinion.

 

I do not try or presume to tell anyone one what they do or do not have to do, and if I

present my opinion that way I apologize to all. I only try to offer my experienced opinion as you do.

 

Steve, lets not start these insinuating posts back and forth, lets remain civil and friendly for the 

sake of the research.

 

And to any and all that read this post the protection ritual is just another diverse tool in our research

tool box, there to use if you personally feel it's necessary.

 

Steve and I have taken different paths as far as research ideas are concerned and felt it would be

more beneficial to us both and to the research on a whole if we pursued individual avenues of research as apposed 

to a research collaboration.

If some of the ripples from this have reached this forum I for one apologise and will do my best to keep my posts to a civil

and professional level.

 

Bruce

I agree Frank, i don't do the protection thing. Yet, i did have a 
couple problems here personally. I guess for people who believe in 
it i guess it couldn't hurt, as for my problems i can't say it was 
from not doing a protection prayer but i also can't say it was. 
Another paranormal toss up for each researcher to decide i guess. 
That's why i never tell anyone what to do, there is no right and 
wrong way to do anything in this field. People just have to draw 
conclusions on their own and get results in the way that they seem 
fit. And than report, and not tell people for a fact that it should 
be done that way. Each person with their own ideas will eventually 
put all the pieces to this paranormal puzzle together.
