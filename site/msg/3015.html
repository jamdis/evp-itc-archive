<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The Superadio III is now marketed under the RCA name and widely available. The circuit board kit (function generator) is also widely available at low cost ($10-$12) and only requires minor modifications to the circuit. Anyone who can operate a screwdriver and a soldering iron can do the whole conversion including purchasing the radio and function generator for under $100, for themselves. Here is an example from a modified Superadio III using the FM band.

Dear Frank Sumption and Fans of Random Broadcast Vocals,

I&#x27;m completely indebted to Frank for receiving the inspiration for Frank&#x27;s
Box and his hard work leading to working boxes for experimenters use. I&#x27;m
sure all this open access to his schematics and results inspired me to use a
scanning type FM receiver for Joe&#x27;s Box. The success had with both types of
boxes supports the idea of random functions in our world contain
intelligence that can be extracted as intelligible messages.

In my case, the curiosity of Steve Hultay and the timely transfer of his
hard earned funds to finance parts created the economic conditions needed. I
can see that wide spread production of communicator hardware will take
funds. However, a nice clone of the old GE Super Radio produced currently in
China is ideal to apply a scanning tuning voltage. These sets are retailing
for $35-$45. The mini-box is certainly overpriced and poor by comparison.

Joecioppi

P.S. Hi Frank

&gt;
&gt;   *Thank you, Frank!  There you have it!  The last time I checked, the U.S.
&gt; of A. was a &quot;Capitalist&quot; country...! That simply means making or buying
&gt; wholesale a product that will retail for more money than was invested thus
&gt; making a Profit.  You want an example?  You just have to look at Thomas
&gt; Edison and Nickola Tesla.  Both were brilliant men,  pioneers in their
&gt; field,  which was basically the same for both.  One was more brilliant than
&gt; the other,  in turn the less brilliant &quot;stole&quot; ideas and products from the
&gt; other.  The most brilliant was not a &quot;Capitalist&quot;,  he devoted his time and
&gt; efforts to &quot;bettering the lives of mankind&quot;.  The lessor was indeed a
&gt; &quot;Capitalist&quot;,  his motives were less noble,  however,  and he was willing to
&gt; &quot;better&quot; mankind,  too,  but make a good profit in the process.  We all know
&gt; the story...one is foremost in the eyes of the general public,  became
&gt; personally rich and famous,  while the other died broke and without
&gt; fanfare.  A shame,  but factual,  none-the-less.  Would you work for free?
&gt; Would you supply people with something they want without recompense?  I
&gt; think not.  I certainly wouldn&#x27;t!  Get real.  Bruce is going to post a
&gt; capture, he says, from Nickola Tesla.  I predict that it will be a
&gt; warning... &quot;Don&#x27;t Do What I Did!  Make a Profit!&quot;    --Rod  *

&gt;   Well...Mean Bitch week was last week, so I was trying to be nice. Yeah,
&gt; I can make a box for like $50 if it&#x27;s on perf board, and $100 if it on PCB,
&gt; the bare board alone is about $46. The only problem I have is the time. It
&gt; takes two weeks minumum to get a box together and working. Most people would
&gt; like to get paid for their time. I make about $40 an hour at my real job. (
&gt; been here 24 years!) Someday this stuff will get mass produced in China, and
&gt; be included in every cell phone!

&gt;
&gt;   I realize the time it takes to put things together. Especially units
&gt; built from the ground up but if you are taking on the duty of spreading the
&gt; technology to help mankind, to me it would be a labor of love. I can see and
&gt; accept recovering production costs even, but this guy is looking to make a
&gt; huge profit.
&gt;
&gt; You gained your respect and credibility on the fact that you have a system
&gt; that works and you are willing to give it away when you didn&#x27;t have to
&gt; Frank. This guy is coming out of the gate with a cheap imitation of EVP
&gt; maker and your system (both of which are free) and putting a huge price tag
&gt; on it. It just don&#x27;t sit right with me!
&gt;
&gt; Honestly, I know it is none of my business what Ron does but I guess I
&gt; just needed to register my protest with this seemingly blatant attempt at
&gt; exploiting good though naive people.
&gt;

&gt;  Interesting. I can see the price for early models. This stuff take tons
&gt; of time to put together. I don&#x27;t want to fault anyone ---yet. I couldn&#x27;t
&gt; figure out how to sell the things, and keep it honest, but all that does is
&gt; deny everyone from using it.

&gt;   $400 to $650 dollars a unit. This guy is retarded! If he is selling this
&gt; unit, he doesn&#x27;t get it Frank!
