Using a test \n =\r\n                   target is one way of establishing a \n                   =\r\n truth in time, which is the basis of this experiment. \n                   =\r\n But there are a couple of issues.\n                    =C2=A0\n             =\r\n       It is quite possible that someone could discern the \n               =\r\n     target through remote viewing alone.\n                    This would ne=\r\ngate the need for involvement of a spirit \n                    communicator=\r\n or discarnate entity.\n                    Outcomes=C2=A0depend on the word=\r\n of those reporting. \n                    The true skeptic (not cynic) woul=\r\nd \n                    therefore say that this experiment contains a basic =\r\n\n                    flaw in that it=C2=A0does not uniquely \n              =\r\n      indicate that the information was obtained in the \n                  =\r\n  prescribed manner. Providing access\n                    to the raw audio =\r\nfile would not necessarily constitute \n                    proof either, si=\r\nnce many of these \n                    communications can only be heard by =\r\ncertain people, \n                    \n                    =C2=A0\n          =\r\n          If the audio file were quite clear, \n                    timing=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0becomes an issue. In other words, when was \n                   =\r\n \n                    the audio actually recorded?=C2=A0 This issue can be =\r\n\n                    mitigated simply by requiring any\n                    =\r\nclaimant to email the audio file to a trusted party \n                    be=\r\nfore the test ends. It would be best \n                    if the trusted pa=\r\nrty were not otherwise involved in the \n                    experiment and =\r\nit was=C2=A0 their duty \n                    simply to=C2=A0collect the cla=\r\nims. Once all claims had \n                    been collected they could be =\r\nposted \n                    publicly for review=C2=A0by the community in \n =\r\n                   general.=C2=A0 The experimenter could decide if any \n   =\r\n                 of the claims seemed to have hit,=C2=A0and this \n         =\r\n           decision could be reviewed by anyone if desired. \n              =\r\n      =C2=A0\n                    The important detail however is that this =\r\nexperiment \n                    does not completely answer the \n           =\r\n         question. It is a first attempt and certainly can be \n            =\r\n        improved on successive trials.\n                    =C2=A0\n         =\r\n           Successive trials are always a good idea, since it \n            =\r\n        provides replication. And it would be\n                    best if o=\r\nthers replicated the experiment using a very \n                    similar p=\r\nrotocol. If these were to\n                    succeed, the community could =\r\nthen state that out of X \n                    trials Y had succeeded (by \n =\r\n                   some definition of success) potentially=C2=A0giving a \n =\r\n                   success rate above that expected \n                    by=\r\n random chance. This would make the outcome \n                    quantifiab=\r\nle and measureable \n                    and thus meaningful.\n              =\r\n      =C2=A0\n                    But also important to note, this would onl=\r\ny prove the \n                    potential veracity of the messages.\n      =\r\n              It would not (and cannot as far as I can tell) prove \n       =\r\n             the origin of the messages.
