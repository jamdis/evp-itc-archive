You just create fear with that crap, and \nfear feeds itself. Once again, you will create what you expect to \nget. If you use protection BS, you&#39;ll have convinced yourself that \nthere is something to be affraid of, and so you will tend to creat a \nthoughtform to fulfill that expectation.\n\n Frank-S\n\n\n --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have written up the short protection ritual I use before every \n&gt; session, I have been using it for quite a while now and have had no \n&gt; problems with dark heads other than the occasional curse word.\n&gt; \n&gt; I recommend that all researchers experienced and new use this or a \n&gt; similar protection ritual before every box session if you are not \n&gt; already. \n&gt; \n&gt; hey it&#39;s better to have it and not need it , than need it and not \nhave \n&gt; it!\n&gt; \n&gt; I will post it in the files section in a folder marked \n&gt; &quot;protection ritual&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks guy&#39;s\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;"}
