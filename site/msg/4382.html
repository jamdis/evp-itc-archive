Willy,
  Your "desert" files reminded me: how many are thinking about the possibility that these contacts are alien and not of the "spirit" world as we think of it?
  Has anyone read any of Mark Macy's books?  He puts forth detailed transcripts of communications received via ITC that claim we on earth are the descendents of colonists from a planet that once existed between Earth and Mars.  When the planet was destroyed, our ancestors were stranded here and had to start from scratch.  Fascinating stuff.  Apparently, for centuries the deceased inhabitants of the "mother planet" have been trying to establish communication with us via spirit communication methods--most recently, ITC--to help speed our redevelopment to the previous level.
  Just thinking, because of your "alien-esque" communications.
  Ursula

done. I've gotten a lot of stuff and would really like to run it by 
someone else. I asked my wife, and she got a blank look, blinked

I've read that "lower entities" come across more on EVPmaker, but so 
far I haven't had any rude experiences � yet. Two days ago I forgot to 
start the sessions with protection prayer/rules of engagement, and 
right away a Scottish voice said, "Aye, it smells in here." I've got 
another folder worth of stuff to upload, but want to get some comments 
about my previous files first..
I've noticed two Bills here already, so to avoid confusion, I'll go by 
Willy�.
Thanks
Willy
