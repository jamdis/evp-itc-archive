Try anyway =
though.  I don't know how your personal  beliefs here work, but 
others see=

I would also  suggest anyone who tries this experiment, to pos=

All you have to do is ask your boxes/spirits/  aliens/etc, what it is.

there is no way I can squirm  out of the results:

Please do not try to =

Answers anyone reveals after noon  Wednesday don't count. P=
