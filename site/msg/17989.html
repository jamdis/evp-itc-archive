&gt; Did you get the picture i sent?  I don&#x27;t really know how it relates, but it
&gt; once worked, spirit used it to speak through it, some how forming vocal
&gt; cords out of this ectoplasm like stuff I think.  The trumpet would sit on a
&gt; desk or floor, and lift up all by itself, and sometimes fly around the room
&gt; to each person, I had a really hard time believing, but I checked things out
&gt; over the years, and when a room full of about 15 to 20 people all hear the
&gt; name, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; in thin air speak his name, and he has a deep strong
&gt; voice too, then ya gotta believe.  We were told back in the early 60&#x27;s that
&gt; one day, we would have a phone where we would be able to speak with loved
&gt; ones on the their side.  So, you inventors that have been given this
&gt; privilege, and soon, well, you,ll see. sf

&gt;&gt;   It&#x27;s going to sound silly to you Frank, but I still have my old spirit
&gt;&gt; trumpet, it&#x27;s about 60 or more years old now, i got it from a man that made
&gt;&gt; them back in the heydays for spiritualism, it would sit in the middle of a
&gt;&gt; room, where people sat for seance, and it would take the energy of the
&gt;&gt; people and from the medium, and a glass of water was in the room and fly
&gt;&gt; about, and get direct spirit voice, it&#x27;s said, that at one time spirit was
&gt;&gt; able to some how form these &quot;spiritual vocal cords&quot; inside the trumpet pipe,
&gt;&gt; and talk.  I know, it sounds crazy, but it did use to happen, and it was not
&gt;&gt; a gimmick, Trumpets are made of a hard aluminum pipe light weight long tube,
&gt;&gt; i have a picture of it if you&#x27;d like to see it, maybe it&#x27;s the same type
&gt;&gt; principle  your using in the box. sf

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    When I first &quot;got&quot; the idea for the box, using a chamber was poionted
&gt;&gt; out to me kinda telepathicly. It seems to function as a space where the
&gt;&gt; sound can be manipulated easier by the entities, and using different
&gt;&gt; materials seems to get different levels. When I use aluminum, that seems to
&gt;&gt; facilitate ET contact more often than not using the chamber. Using pipe
&gt;&gt; helps make the chambers smaller. Thre seems to be a filtering effect by the
&gt;&gt; chamber that tends to enhance the voices. Most of the boxes I make have an
&gt;&gt; option to use the chambers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  The mind contact that poined out the chamber--I think--was that shadow
&gt;&gt; guy on the group home page.
