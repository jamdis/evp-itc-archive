Even though I have only recently posted some clips,\nI have been using my Frank&#39;s Boxes and the Mini quite a bit.  Got the\nFBs last June and the Mini in Dec.  I&#39;m often at the mercy of book\ndeadlines & travel, so I have to just lurk a lot on the forum.  The\n&quot;conditioning&quot; certainly improves with usage, and I seem to be getting\nprogressively better results.\n\nRosemary\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristin Morris&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; REG - I watched the YouTube and I heard the clips without watching.  You\n&gt; have very strong communication with the Mini.  \n&gt; \n&gt; k\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of\n&gt; rosemary_guiley\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 30, 2008 6:03 PM\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] You Tube Video and Audio\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Folks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Recently I did an investigation at the Lincoln Theater in Decatur, IL\n&gt; with my Mini-Box, and got some interesting clips from the basement\n&gt; area. The files are too large to be uploaded to the forum here, but a\n&gt; short video with the audio clips has been posted on You Tube by Joey\n&gt; Tito, a Chicago researcher who filmed the investigation. The audio\n&gt; clips are at the end, and Joey matched them to a transcript of what I\n&gt; picked up. I sent the clips to Frank, and he picked up even more.\n&gt; \n&gt; The You Tube link is www.youtube.com/xflexx1 Joey has a short version\n&gt; and a long version; pick the short one.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a report on the investigation posted on my blog on MySpace at\n&gt; www.myspace.com/rosemaryellenguiley and Joey&#39;s video is on my home\n&gt; page there as well. The blog also has my report on a similar\n&gt; investigation at Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield; the clips from\n&gt; that are posted on this forum in my folder.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Rosemary\n&gt;"}
