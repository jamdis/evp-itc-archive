It&#39;s just me?  (I&#39;m just that loveable?) \n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jill&quot; &lt;jjkamp@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On New Year&#39;s Eve and New Year&#39;s Day I did two sessions with two different sets of participants.  The messages always seem to be the same, though:  &quot;I love you.&quot;  Over and over, threading all through the recording, both in the background, and more overtly when I ask a specific question such as, &quot;Do you have a message for Heather?&quot;  Does anyone else get this?  I mean, it&#39;s flattering and all, but it doesn&#39;t really mean that much when I don&#39;t know for sure who&#39;s telling me this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, &quot;they&quot; seem quite ready to tell me their first names, but almost never their last names.  Why?  Do last names cease to exist on the other side?  Or is there some unwritten rule that says verifiable information can&#39;t be passed along?  If so, who makes and enforces these rules?\n&gt; \n&gt; And if they can so easily say a name four times in a row (yesterday it was my friend&#39;s grandfather&#39;s name Donald), why can&#39;t they say one word to me that would mean something?  Or to my friend Heather?  We both asked, and got nothing, at least not that we could discern.  It would seem a simple thing to say the word plumber (that was my dad&#39;s secret word) or some other single-syllable word.  Now I&#39;m pretty sure I really did talk to my dad, as I had another &quot;contact&quot; from him in my waking dream state the other morning, but if it&#39;s really him, why can&#39;t he say something he would&#39;ve said in life?  Why do I have the nagging feeling that &quot;they&quot; aren&#39;t human and never were? \n&gt; \n&gt; I just don&#39;t get it!  Any thoughts, guys?\n&gt;"}
