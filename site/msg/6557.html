<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all,

 Ralph the Ghost Hunter here. Just letting you all know I have posted 
some new RS 12-469 files as MP3 files to save space. I hope you all 
enjoy them as some of these are very interesting. I doubt if any radio 
stations said any of what I posted on here from the RS Hack Box. You 
can tell me what your thoughts are on them if you like. Maybe some of 
you may understand what they are trying to say. Oh well you all take 
care for now and keep up the good work people. I do like the one that 
called me a &quot; Dumb shit &quot; LOL when I asked &quot; who are the Shadow 
People ? &quot; They are funny sometimes. You gotta love it. The RS 20-125 
model seems to be alittle clearer with less clutter I think. Will post 
some of those when I get a chance. Happy Sweeping everyone !!!


Regards,

Ralph the Ghost Hunter</pre>
