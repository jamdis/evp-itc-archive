I posted this one on my esnips for you guys but I just wanted to share this link because Laura K. and I are talking about it now and I think the subject may interest a few of you. I had an evp which states &quot;aliens assist us&quot; I am attaching that one to this post. For those who dont see it you can visit my sweep tuning folder on esnips.

I recently saw one of Ed Grimsley&#x27;s video postings. He uses 3rd or 4th generation nightvision to view whats going on in our sky. I think many people wont be able to digest what it all means but for those of you who can:

As I said many times not all entities/spirits who speak claim to have been born, or even human in nature. I find it all of interest to me because personally I have seen and heard quite a few things which people dont want to believe.
