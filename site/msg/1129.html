Hi All;

Been on nights all week, now swithced back to days, but haven&#x27;t had time to 
get much done. The volume control wasn&#x27;t working, so thought I needed a 
buffer, but that wasn&#x27;t it, so took that out, and replaced the band switch, 
that also switched a single voulme control between the AM and FM tuners, a 
function done by the radio processor, inside the radio, but I have to 
accomplish manually. I think I had the dual volume controls crossed somehow. 
In the past I used a mixer the add the stereo outputs from the FM tuner 
together, and that also served as a way to use a single volume control on 
the output of the mixer for the echo box speaker driver, since I used just 
another mixer channel for AM. Now I want to preserve the stereo function, 
and use two seperate amps, for two echo box speakers. The new band switch 
was an old power switch from a Kodak slide porjector. I needed a triple pole 
double throw switch.  The is Geekdom at it&#x27;s best!

This also makes the EVP/ITC setup seem complicated, which I wanted to avoid. 
It&#x27;s really just a radio, and triangle wave generator. I tried just 
converting a pocket radio, but I run into problems with the IF frequency, 
and was gettign birdies across the band.
