Electronic Voice Phenomena is a completely different\nanimal. That is not to say however that one couldn&#39;t get an EVP during a\nghost box session.\n\nOn Wed, Jun 9, 2010 at 3:04 PM, tim_woolworth &lt;tim@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So you have stated that the person conducting this study was an EVP expert?\n&gt; That leads me to question how the study was actually conducted. Listening to\n&gt; the box is certainly not like listening to an EVP and I personally disagree\n&gt; vehemently with the people out there who call box communications EVP&#39;s!\n&gt;\n&gt; In an EVP situation, you are listening closely for a voice to sound\n&gt; typically over the quiet. A box session forces one to listen through the\n&gt; noise as opposed to the silence.\n&gt;\n&gt; Were these sessions recorded and listened back too or was an analysis made\n&gt; strictly from real time? I do sessions all the time and I am lucky if I can\n&gt; pick up 35% of what comes through in real time.\n&gt;\n&gt; And finally, try not to be too dismayed. An EVP &#39;expert&#39; makes their bread\n&gt; and butter parading their EVP techniques. I witnessed one such expert who we\n&gt; all have at least heard of create an EVP. How? The person in question\n&gt; scratched their thumb nail against the recorders mic to create a sound. This\n&gt; person then played back the recorder to me and pitched it down to make what\n&gt; this person say what was heard sound more convincing.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I made my money parading my EVP ability, I would discredit your box too.\n&gt; Why? Because box users are the future of ITC and paranormal research. It is\n&gt; relatively cheap, vastly available, and provides instant gratuity when\n&gt; operating. Who wants to sit alone in the dark talking to silence when you\n&gt; can hear the responses in real time? EVP is still a valid form of\n&gt; communication, but ghost boxes threaten an EVP experts way to make money.\n&gt; Boxes are being used more and more, especially on the television shows and\n&gt; public hunts. This hurts the revenue stream for EVP experts who used to be\n&gt; the ones getting invited to guest star on hunts for a fee; they are now\n&gt; being replaced by box users.\n&gt;\n&gt; In short, box use can be discredited by every expert and skeptic in the\n&gt; field. It doesn&#39;t matter. Ghost box use now has its place in paranormal\n&gt; culture and it is not going to leave it anytime soon. Being situated in a\n&gt; paranormal group that is lead by a para-celebrity has put me in the unique\n&gt; position of visiting other groups and working with the other\n&gt; para-celebrities in this field quite frequently. I can assure you that ghost\n&gt; boxes aren&#39;t going anywhere because the majority of these people have at\n&gt; least a shack hack in their paranormal arsenal.\n&gt;\n&gt; So let this expert discredit to his or her&#39;s hearts&#39; content. When they\n&gt; publish their results, the results become public and they are on the hook\n&gt; for what they say at that point (which could bite them in the ass one day).\n&gt; Their results will not hurt the work that you are doing today Frank, nor\n&gt; will what they say influence this forums core group in any way because we\n&gt; know the boxes work.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tim\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Frank Sumption\n&gt; &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s probably not kosher to post this, but I find this highly insulting\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; all of us. As usual, igonore all facts and all other methods, such as\n&gt; &gt; EVPmaker, which forms all the voices inside the computer. Ignore all\n&gt; phone\n&gt; &gt; EVP messages, ignore all voices heard with no electronic aids. Ignore\n&gt; &gt; messages received via turned off TV and printers--and on and on, yet they\n&gt; &gt; know all about EVP..Ignore the fact that probably thousands use boxes\n&gt; &gt; successfully.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep EVP\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; the results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of\n&gt; such\n&gt; &gt; devices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how EVP\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; visual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it is\n&gt; &gt; difficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without\n&gt; solid\n&gt; &gt; research supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to\n&gt; &gt; recommend it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies\n&gt; &gt; conducted by experienced researchers that shows it does produce\n&gt; phenomena,\n&gt; &gt; we would gladly promote it as an alternative technique.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We are pretty sure that, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the voice\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; formed in the electronics by transforming available audio-frequency noise\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; an active part of the electronics such as a transistor junction. We think\n&gt; &gt; the process is amplification of a weak telekinetic signal via stochastic\n&gt; &gt; resonance and we have found that the optimum audio-frequency signal for\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; is a chaotic one rich in voice-frequencies with many transient\n&gt; perturbation.\n&gt; &gt; That is our working hypothesis. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t say who this is from, cuz almost certain I&#39;d get sued. There&#39;s no\n&gt; &gt; double blind testing their BS either.
