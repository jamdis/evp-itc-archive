<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You would have to build what is called a &quot;Black Hole antenna&quot; in order to 
get uniform signal strength over the entire AM band.  This is from a 
design by John F. Sutton of NASA.  He holds a US patent, number 5296866. I 
also have the original papers he published on it.

No one commercially manufactures and sells a &quot;Black Hole antenna&quot; but many 
people have built them and are using them successfully.

&gt; I just had a Select A Tenna delivered to me in Mexico by a friend.  Unfortunately this one functions by dialing in the channel you want so it isn&#x27;t functioning in a way that can be used with a scanning EVP setup.  I think a non dialer is available with the same company and that is what I ordered but I need to go back in a check.  Another $60 down.  I hope to use it to get Coast to Coast from San Antonio so it isn&#x27;t all lost.

&gt;  Jeremy   I listened to your posts and you got some great captures there.  I am encouraged because Mike is sending me a RS 125 for me to pick up in San Diego next month.  Sounds a lot better than my 469.   Ron L

&gt;          I&#x27;ve heard of something called AM DXing. Not that familiar with it
&gt; though. Somehow you are supposed to be able to boost your signal
&gt; without any external device such as a Select-A-Tenna. I need to read
&gt; into it further.
&gt;
&gt; I am very seriously considering buying a Select-A-Tenna.
