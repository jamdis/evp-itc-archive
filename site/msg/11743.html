Ahh, I thought he was talking about something else. :)  I've heard of this method before but haven't ever tried it.  I've got a couple of fish tanks that sound like waterfalls in them, so I might give it a try. 

Thanks,
Bryan

Basically its recording h2o sound. For me I usually record with the tank running in the background. You can use fountain noise, ocean waves, bubbling brooks, waterfalls, the shower...try it all if you like. I have even had some success using a loop of water sounds as background noise but I get the best loudest results with just the fish tank in the background across the room. 

With water I find that being very close to the source is often too much sound and tends to drown the voices out. Also most speak to me at amazingly fast rates of speed so most voices that are loud, clear and speaking longer sentences are found in the -74 speed range for my recordings. This could be due in part to the fact I only record for 30-40 seconds using that method and they tend to have alot to say. Some can be found at normal speed as well as other rates. 

When I got my first evp the tank was running. I havent changed the setup much since the beginning using thier suggestions and trying new things along the way. They have been helpful over the years with suggestions for settings etc. 

I always end up going back to h20 method for clarification because sometimes the tones are amazing and surprisingly lifelike as in matches what they sounded like when alive (for those I knew personally anyway). I have seen glimpses of this using many different methods. Just experiment and see what works best for you!
