the trumpet mediums used along time ago, were not the kind that play, they  
were light weight materials, that some how spirits could use to talk to us, 
if  you don't believe me, then ask them yourself.

Hellooooo :) Have we all forgotten how "mediums" were popping up everywhere 
 back then ;) It was big money. There were always FAKES to be found :) Why  
waste your energy (spirit)on blowing a silly trumpet if you could just use  
your ecto-vocal cords :) to tell ALL. I'm sure they would want to "tell" us 
 where they were, and how they reach us instead of doing the AMAZING 
trumpet  playing :) Voicing back then would be expected to have these answers...it 
was  easier to draw paying customers with just "tricks". --- In
