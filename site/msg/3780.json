I have also been told ofanother device that canbe purchased for \nvery little from anyelectronics merchant andaltered by hand, \nproducing what some considerto be results. As Iexpected, the samples \nthat people have sent me are*nothing morethan timed radio scans that \nhave no validity.* [emphasismine]&quot;These new &quot;radio scanners&quot; are not \nonly *a waste of money*forpeople looking to do research with them in \nhopes of havingeffectivecommunication with the other side, but may in \nfact be *verydangerous*.Should demonic and other negative entities \nlearn to usethesefalsedevices, *the results could be \ndevastating.*&quot;...The CatholicChurch ... predicted the widespread sale \nof*false communicationdevices* as far back as last year. *I have \nrecentlybegun to receiverequests from individuals asking for help to \nclosenegative doorwaysand portals that they believe they opened \nusingtheir purchasedTelephone to the Dead replica*. Others are \nclaiming&gt; that I am a fraudbecause their purchased device doesn&#39;t \nproducethe positive results Ihave been fortunate enough to have.&quot;So \nlet&#39;s go throug thisagain:*nothing more than timed radio scans that \nhave no validity.**awaste of money**very dangerous**the results could \nbedevastating.**false communication devices**I have recently begun \ntoreceive requests from individuals asking forhelp to close \nnegativedoorways and portals that they believe theyopened using \ntheirpurchased Telephone to the Dead replica.*As you see, there are \ntwostatements that Chris is making--so much forhe&#39;s always \nconsistant,which I believe was an earlier statement thatyou made.1. \nThe new boxescreate accidental timed radio scans only.2. The new \nboxes are verydangerous because they draw negative results.I&#39;m not \nsure how the twostatements can stand together, but in eithercase, his \nopinion isclearly not complimentary toward the rest of thebox users \nbesides thefour of the 30 he says, in the same post, &quot;havebeen \nidentified.&quot;Rathercheeky and insulting and wrong, HMO.
