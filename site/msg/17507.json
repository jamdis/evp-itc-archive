I am still amazed when any\n&gt; voice comes through, even if they are negative (which does happen very\n&gt; rarely). And how can you tell when you have ET&#39;s communicating?

It seems like there is a lot\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conversation between many voices here and they are talking about\n&gt; calling. At\n&gt; &gt; &gt; .08, somebody is tee&#39;d off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is something to labeling affecting subliminal interpretation.\n&gt; When I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; read your interpretation of the &quot;jesus&quot; line at the beginning, that is\n&gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I heard through the speakers first and foremost. I turned the speakers\n&gt; off\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and used studio grade headphones for analysis. Voila, no Jesus. I guess\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was resurrected from this clip! I often wonder if the sound waves\n&gt; between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speaker and listener are manipulated in some way. This is why I like to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; listen in enclosed headphones, that way your ear is directly against\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sound source.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That said, this is what I hear from your clip:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; @.01: &quot;He&#39;s calling you, he&#39;s a (unclear)&quot; (male, electronic)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; @.03: It amounts to scheisse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; @.05: &quot;Make sure he has the date&quot; (male)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; @.06: &quot;May Eighteenth&quot; (electronic)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; @.08: &quot;Fuck this guy&quot; (male)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; @.09: Singing - &quot;He doesn&#39;t call her, call her (?anymore?)&quot; (female)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; @.12: He doesn&#39;t seem to reply (male)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; @.13: Steve (?Coogle? - unclear)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I know you typically don&#39;t interact with the box by asking questions,\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have you ever tried telling them to communicate one at a time? It works\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me most of the time when multiple voices crowd the box. Regardless,\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; definitely like communicating with you.

In some\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; clips, you can definitely hear them talking amongst themselves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The main voice you hear (especially in clip 4) is my technician,\n&gt; or as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; call him, my facilitator. He is the one telling Raudive to ask his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; question\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and telling an Other to wait. I have numerous clips where I will\n&gt; ask a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; question and I can hear him ask the same question of the Others.\n&gt; This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the personal proof I need (besides my name and facts about my life\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coming\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; through a broken radio). To hear your own words coming through the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; radio in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a different voice is something that should be considered\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impossible...but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; then to get an answer back from those reiterated words, well, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consider\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that pretty damn good evidence that there is an intelligence\n&gt; trying to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; communicate.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; But then again, any scientist can easily say that I was\n&gt; experiencing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; nothing more that a Ham radio operator having fun at my expense.\n&gt; My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; come back to this is that since I still a ghost hunter, I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; traveled\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; extensively to different locations.
