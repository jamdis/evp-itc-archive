<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I haven&#x27;t done this long enough to notice that pattern, but I have noticed that when asking if anyone wants to talk I&#x27;ve received back an answer of &quot;one&quot; on a few occasions.  Anyone else get this?

&gt; You have probably experienced this too.
&gt; 
&gt; When you first turn a box on, it takes a moment or two of garbled
&gt; communication for it to start working.  It is kind of like clearing
&gt; your throat in the morning.  After this, for my boxes it takes about
&gt; 20 seconds, I get a clear signal that lets me know communication is
&gt; about to start.
&gt; 
&gt; I almost always get this voice.  He comes across loud during an audio
&gt; pause and yells the word &quot;NOW.&quot; Once I hear this, I know communication
&gt; is about to start.  I have asked repeatedly who says &quot;Now&quot; but I never
&gt; get an answer.  It is the same voice every time though.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone else experience this?
&gt; 
&gt; I ask this in particular because I was reading Raudive&#x27;s book again
&gt; and I noted that on page 23 (the section on radio recording) he wrote
&gt; that when trying to find an interfrequency to record on (via direct
&gt; radio voice) one &quot;listens carefully for a voice that will hiss &quot;Now,&quot;
&gt; or &quot;Make Recording,&quot; or some such hint.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I find it interesting that the same clues are left for us 40 years
&gt; after Raudive with a whole new technology (sweeping frequency radio).
&gt; 
&gt; If you do not experience the same &quot;now&quot; as I do, are there any other
&gt; consistent signals you receive from the other side?
