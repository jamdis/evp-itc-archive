My name is Michelle. I'm a certified medium with a Spiritualist church. Thi=

and why I know what I do). I'm also one of the biggest skeptics you'll ever=
 meet (It was one of two reasons I became a medium. I wanted to see how the=
y were "faking" it. Surprise! They weren't). I'd like to contribute what I'=

ence to believe this stuff exists".

er or not the medium received the message correctly and then whether or not=
 he/she interepreted it correctly and phrased it in a way that allowed the =
recipient to understand the spirit's meaning. There are a variety of ways s=
pirits communicate with mediums; some are easier than others to understand =
and pass on. For the harder methods, it would be possible for a medium to i=
nadvertently misinterept the message based on his/her past experiences. 
>>=

>>When we look at the question from the connection to EVP's and ghost boxe=
s, we have to examine a few items. Was the spirit able to use the devices c=
orrectly to form the words he/she actually intended? This is a two step pro=
cess. It can be difficult for them to not only pull the available energy in=
to a useable form, but to also form the correct words (think it as a foreig=
ner learning English and saying "car" when they mean "star". They sound sim=
ilar, but have very different meanings).

>>Did we understand the words =

he same mistake can be made. The only conclusive way is to use equipment th=

some corresponding items that back up their claims, direct you to old newsp=
aper stories or to a person they used to affiliate with or bring the valida=
