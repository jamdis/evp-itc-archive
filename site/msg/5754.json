My group&#39;s name is SPIRIT Paranormal \nInvestigation Team. I have been doing this in groups now for 6 years.\nI had my own group H.I.P.S. (Harrisburg Independent Paranormal \nSociety) and now I am in the SPIRIT group out of Selinsgrove,PA. I \nalso use to be with Kelly Weaver&#39;s group Capital Ghost Forum which is \nnow called Spirit Society of PA. I had to leave her group because of \nmy work schedule. I have been on Ghost Investigations with TAPS to \nWaverly Hills Sanatorium,Ky, Eastern State Pennitentiary in PA. I \nhave \nalso investigated St. Augustine Lighthouse in Fla. I did have a \nchance \nto meet Bill Murphy here in Gettysburg,PA. on the Battlefield near \nthe \nWheatfield last year for a short time. He is a nice guy. I let him \nlisten to some of my EVP&#39;s from the Wheatfield and Triangular Field \nthat day we met. I have been called an &quot; EVP Medium &quot; by my peers. I \nhave a ton of them. I would like to thank &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; for his \ninspiring work with his boxes and giving of his time and knowledge to \ninspire us to do our own research to find the answers we are all \nlooking for in this world. Thanks, Frank for your inspiration and \nhard \nwork we all appreciate it. I would also like to thank &quot;Sum Duck&quot; \nand &quot;Mike Coletta&quot; for coming up with those Hacks that made it easy \nfor me and all the others out there that are Electronically \nilliterate.\nThank you guys we all appreciate it too. Oh well I just wanted to put \nmy two cents in to let you know I&#39;m with you all. Oh, I have two 12-\n469&#39;s the first one I broke trying to hack it LOL. The other one \nworks \ngreat. I also have the 12-470(old model) which I tried to hack but I \ncut the wrong wire. I cut the green wire (seventh wire from the top \nas \nMike said to do)and when I put everything back together I had no AM \nBand LOL. So I opened it up again and was thinking to myself should I \ncut the wire before the green one I had cut or should I cut the wire \nafter the green one. Hmmmm, I thought here goes nothing so I cut the \nyellow wire after the green one number eight from the top. I put it \ntogether as I was crossing my fingers, I tried the FM band and bingo \nit worked great. Just a funny story of how electronically illiterate \nI \nam. I do want to say I do hear alot of voices coming across these \nboxes. I hear them saying their names and sometimes it sounds like \nthey are talking to each other. I have gotten answers to questions \ntoo. Yesterday at my work place I like to listen to it while I&#39;m \nworking here at the Post Office. I heard a male voice say to me &quot;Do \nyou want a Tech ?&quot; I also hear the name Lisa alot and they \nsay &quot;seven&quot; \nalot too. My name has been called alot too. So there has to be \nsomething to these boxes. Oh I also had one say &quot; Hurry dead battery &quot;\nwhich my batteries did die a few minutes later which was cool. I was \nrecording with my voice recorder and picked that up. They say some \nfunny things sometimes too. I did hear one say to me &quot; F__k Off &quot; I \nknow that wasn&#39;t on any radio program LOl. Oh well you have a great \nset up here and it is nice to meet you all. Take care and keep up the \ngreat work you all are doing in your researches. Bye for now !!\n\nRegards,\n\nRalph Smith of &quot;SPIRIT&quot; Paranormal Investigation Team !!!!"}
