Did you hack your 12-820 radio? I just did a test on it and I am not 
totally sure I did the hack right I couldnt find any instructions so 
I just clipped the mute wire. eeeek!!! I still think the AM band is 
sweeping slower than it should it seems to stay one a station longer 
than it should. I am going to open it back up when I get home and 
take a second look.

&gt; Kay,
&gt;  
&gt; The am will sweep a little slower which is normal.  But isn&#x27;t it 
nice  
&gt; without all the clicking?  And the fm sweep is great on that 
unit.  I  have had 
&gt; awesome results with mine and wish you lots of luck with yours.

&gt; I went ahead and opened up my 12-820 RS radio and clipped the mute 
&gt; wire  it is set up simular to the old 12-470 with wires instead of 
&gt; pins. It  sweeps both bands fine. Is there any certain rate the 
band 
&gt; should be  sweeping. I noticed that the FM band sweeps faster then 
the 
&gt; AM  band.
