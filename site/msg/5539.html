<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think it&#x27;s good to air diverse opinions on whether or not protection
measures are advisable.  I agree that it&#x27;s a matter of personal
preference, and I think researchers need to experiment to find their
own optimum comfort/performance levels.  What works for some will not
for others.  

Personally, I find that an overall, daily approach of
prayer/meditation concerning all of my personal and professional
endeavors is the most effective for me.  I don&#x27;t do it to keep things
out, but to try to stay oriented on the most positive track.  Words,
thoughts and objects have all been demonstrated universally to be
tools of spiritual power.  Why not use them if it feels appropriate?

One of the best things we can do is share &quot;here&#x27;s what works for me&quot;
and let others try it to see for themselves.

Thanks, everyone,
Rosemary</pre>
