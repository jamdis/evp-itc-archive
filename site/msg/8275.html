 I had what I thought was a minor problem with the white noise out of the =
second amplifier stage, the signal would go out to lunch when connected to =
the trigger circuit. I was able to use a resistor to match up the circuits =
on the test board, but not so lucky with this second board. I've never had =
this problem with the TL074's, so maybe it's just a quirk of the TL082s. I =
added a FET buffer on the output of the second white noise amp, but didn't =
have time to get it tested tonight, as far as the trigger output goes. The =
FET is an MPF102.
