See scrying gives you away to get past your natural filters and see message=
s directly from the subconscious, that is directly from the astral. Psychic=
s are gifted in a way that they can control their filters. Most of us have =
no clue how to do this.

But this would coincide with Franks and other's th=
eory about some messages only making sense to the person recording them, an=
d that no matter how clear they are to you, others may not hear them.

ligent souls. Think of your subconscious a link to the astral plane. The su=
bconscious is just the scientific word for it. We are all part of the astra=

      Maybe listening to random noise can be an audible way of scrying.=
