Frank,

Sylvia told the Hornbeck family on Montell Williams show that their 
kidnapped son was murdered by a man of color with dreadlocks and 
told them that his body was lying by some large boulders in a 
ravine. Their son was then found alive and living with a caucasion 
child molester.

Then, last year on C2C, the night of the mining accident when all of 
the miners were found dead except one, she told Norry that they 
would all be found alive. When the news that they were all dead came 
across live on the air, she then denied that she made that earlier 
statement. In other words, she lied to millions of people on the 
radio.

I can provide the You-tube clips if you want to hear them.

James
