For Elvis to &quot;encode directly&quot; to the media, he would have to do\n&gt; what that software does to the digital signals coming in from the AtoD\n&gt; converter: he would have to group the bits into (for example) 16 little\n&gt; herds each, decide on the specific bit interpretation scheme (2&#39;s\n&gt; complement?),  find space on the media, update the media&#39;s dictionary of\n&gt; where there is free space and where there isn&#39;t, link the herds together\n&gt; with some sort of linked pointer, skip around the areas marked &#39;bad&#39; on the\n&gt; media, update things like date/time modified and size, respect any kind of\n&gt; ownership permissions on the media, and so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is much more credible for the signal to be manipulated near the AtoD\n&gt; converter (where EMF changes would have the most straighforward result) than\n&gt; in the digital media itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Wed, 5/20/09, April Abercrombie &lt;\n&gt; april@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: I have a question.\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, May 20, 2009, 1:05 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;  ﻿\n&gt; &quot;Probably not &quot;directly&quot;, since that would mean grandma would have to have\n&gt; quite an understanding of digital encoding, including which bits mean what,\n&gt; when, and where.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Not necessarily- maybe it is that just by trying to communicate through our\n&gt; equipment, it happens automatically.

But even on a digital recorder, there is still an analog\n&gt; element (the Analog to Digital converter) which takes the sound pressure\n&gt; waves, as represented by some analog electronic detection element, and\n&gt; converts that into digital.  That way, long departed uncle Ebenezer does not\n&gt; need to do anything digital.  Under this scenario, if sound is not being\n&gt; heard in the room, but is being induced into the circuitry, then it would be\n&gt; round about that AtoD converter (assuming it isn&#39;t other just plain old\n&gt; noise in the digital elements).\n&gt;\n&gt; Someone with more electronic know-how than me might be able to better\n&gt; pinpoint the area in the analog portion of that AtoD pipeline where it would\n&gt; be most likely it could be influenced by, say, an EM field, and that would\n&gt; also occur in a normal analog tape recorder.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Wed, 5/20/09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch.\n&gt; com&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: I have a question.\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, May 20, 2009, 12:29 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;   This is what I think true EVP is Eric.

I tape a session and\n&gt;&gt; review it later..  even a day later.  Upon review the message that comes\n&gt;&gt; over is about something that ‘just happened’ while I was reviewing or\n&gt;&gt; happened after taping?  Is it possible that spirit can manipulate the\n&gt;&gt; recording AFTER recording has stopped or even manipulate the audio while\n&gt;&gt; reviewing?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; An give you an example of this I was recording one day and I reviewed the\n&gt;&gt; audio the next day.  While reviewing – about half way through – the message\n&gt;&gt; “Your mother is calling” was found.  I saved it and moved on and within two\n&gt;&gt; seconds my mom called.  You say it is a coincidence except that I hadn’t\n&gt;&gt; spoken to my mother in over a year.  During this same conversation with her\n&gt;&gt; – we sorta made amends and I told her the story of the ‘secret’ I had found\n&gt;&gt; out about a family member having a child out of wedlock in the late 1920s.\n&gt;&gt; Quick backstory.. I found out about this out-of-wedlock birth through my\n&gt;&gt; genealogy research and contacted spirit through the box and I was promptly\n&gt;&gt; told to keep it secret and which I promised to do…\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Well in this conversation with my mom after not speaking for a year I told\n&gt;&gt; her what I had found out.  When the telephone conversation ended with my\n&gt;&gt; mom… I was amazed that the recording had told me she would call right be\n&gt;&gt; fore she did – even though the audio was recorded the previous day.  I\n&gt;&gt; proceeded to go back to reviewing the audio and the very first thing I heard\n&gt;&gt; was:  THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SECRET – YOU LIED.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Maybe they can manipulate ‘real-time’ literally??? ?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; k\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  ------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *From:* EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com] *On\n&gt;&gt; Behalf Of *April Abercrombie\n&gt;&gt; *Sent:* Wednesday, May 20, 2009 11:36 AM\n&gt;&gt; *To:* EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;&gt;  *Subject:* Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: I have a question.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  2 different things happening-that&#39; s why. When you get EVP that everyone\n&gt;&gt; understands,  it is outward, in the environment. Not a communication through\n&gt;&gt; subconscious means.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; EVP that people swear they hear, but noone else can make sense, may be a\n&gt;&gt; message to them via subconscious means. That isn&#39;t to say that ALL EVP&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; like this are true messages, I am sure alot are just matrixing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But then that is how the art of scrying starts-matrixing. Like the\n&gt;&gt; Rorschach tests. The images you matrix with those gives the psychologist an\n&gt;&gt; insight into your mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; By gazing into a dark, reflective surface, you start to see cloudy images.\n&gt;&gt; At first, you will just be matrixing faces in the clouds and not getting\n&gt;&gt; much substance. Try it, you will see what I am saying. With practice, you\n&gt;&gt; start to see clear, concise images.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think that is what happening with audio as well.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We already know for a fact pareidolia can occur in audio as well as visual\n&gt;&gt; stimulus.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *From:* Eric VanDuzer\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *To:* EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *Sent:* Wednesday, May 20, 2009 10:19 AM\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *Subject:* Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: I have a question.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; yes I understand its personal to that particular individual but why can&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; I hear it.
