<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I finally broke down and got a digital SLR (Nikon D70S) two years ago. 
The neat thing about it is you can vary the equivalent of &quot;ISO speed&quot; 
from 200 to 1600 in 1/2 or 1/3 stop steps. So I can set it for 1600 for 
low-light shots and no flash.

If you&#x27;re taking flash pictures you probably need to set the shutter at 
whatever the manufacturer recommends and use other appropriate settings. 
My Canon F-1 uses 1/125 second for the flash setting.

If you&#x27;re not taking flash photos, get the fastest film you can find.  I 
think Kodak has an ISO 800 color film available.  I used to use some B&amp;W 
Kodak film with a ridiculously fast speed like 3200 but it was super 
grainy and you had to make absolutely sure your darkroom was totally 
dark when you put it in the developing tank.

I calculated that my digital SLR would pay for itself just in lack of film 
and developing costs when I got to around 2500 photos with it.  I&#x27;ve gone 
way past that in less than two years.

&gt; Hey Guys,
&gt;
&gt; Any of you still use a 35mm to take pictures with? I have 2 of them
&gt; and tried over the weekend to utilize them in an investigation. The
&gt; exposure time on these things is like 30 seconds. It&#x27;s such a pain in
&gt; the butt. If you do use the 35mm, what kind of settings do you use?
&gt; Any advice? I am totally new to night photography. Has everyone gone
&gt; to digital now or what?
