  daughters, Emily (15), Molly (12), & Hannah (10).  I'm a 38-year-old computer technician.
   
  I have been reading paranormal literature since I was a kid.  I have read probably hundreds of books
  on the subject.  I have lived in two haunted houses, and I had a paranormal experience at my 
  grandparents' house as a child.  I've always found the subject fascinating.  Things go on here in
  the house I live in now.  We have had the sound of women talking just out of earshot, footsteps,
  shadows, etc.
   
  A couple of years ago I started reading about EVP and ITC and started getting some equipment to
  do my own investigating.  If only there was a local group that didn't see faces in the grass and
  think that every bit of dust was an orb!  My standards as to what amounts to evidence of a haunting 
  and what does not are pretty high.  I'm thinking about starting my own group, but that's aside   from this. 

   
  My wife bought me a 2gb Olympus digital voice recorder for Christmas, and I have Cool Edit on
  my machine, so I have been thinking about trying my hand at recording.  I have a copy of the
  Ghost Orchid on CD, containing Raudive's work; and I have been surfing the web, listening
  to other recordings.  When I heard about Frank's Box, I naturally became excited.  Then I
  found a link to this group mentioned in an email about it.  So, I joined.
   
  I'm going to listen to the file attachments for awhile and read the posts and sit back and learn
  some more before I give it a try.
   
  Thanks for having me!
   
  Wes
