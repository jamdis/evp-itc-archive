For some reason, that attachment doesn't seem to be working, at least for m=
e. I will send it in a new post.

  No this was =
a constant recording. This was caught in an empty room on my camcorder foot=
age, as well as on some other recording devices. 

  That coupled with the =
EMF spikes at the same time confirm that it was in the house, not in the ma=
chinery. If it is a static discharge, something is still causing it. But it=
 doesn't sound like a static discharge. I say tap, but it is more of a shar=
p pop.  I am attaching a clip of the sound if you want to hear it.

  This =
went on constantly throughout the entire time we were there, about 4 hours.=

          It could: if you've ever noticed the tap so=
und when starting or stopping a recording session, assuming it is not being=
 caused by pushing a switch in the mic, the tap or pop you hear can be caus=
ed by the electronics as it begins to ceases recording.

          Also a s=
tatic charge can cause the pop.

            Thanks! Would t=

                    Yes.  Also faulty wirin=
g, which is even more dangerous.
                    Also with flakey trans=

          =
          Perhaps you can check with some neighbors, and see how their powe=

                      Hi All,

                     =
 Is there someone here that can answer and electrical question for me?

   =
                   During the case that I recorded those possible EVP's-the=
re was a loud tapping noise that seemed to come from the 2nd bedroom. Upon =
checking my logs, every time one of  these clicks were heard, there would b=
e an EMF spike in the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livingro=
om downstairs. The home owners have also reported that they have a touch la=
mp that comes on all the time by itself and the lights in the Kitchen will =
dim occasionally.

                      Now these taps are not consistent =
in timing, loudness or rhythm. Could this be the work of faulty breakers?

=
                      Thanks!
                      April
