I've got the 20-125 and an older 12-469 sans speaker and clicking.  The 20-125 works wonderfully and has produced great results.  The 12-469 has produced great results also.  Bruce can testify to the communication he gets with the 20-125.  

In the end, it all depends on signal strength and our spirit friends capability to communicate, not to mention our state of mind when we conduct a session.  There are a lot of variables involved, so there really is no one box better than the others in my opinion.  Although, Frank seems to get some tremendous results with his creations.

I'm actually going to attempt a Speakjet box.  I hope I can get past my semi-electronic retardedness and make it work.

                Hi Laura.  I would recommend you buy BOTH of the old 12-470's, as those units are very 
hard to come by.  I'm sure someone would be happy to buy the second one from you, and 
you can make use of the first.  If you don't like it, you can sell it too. 

I've not tried the 20-125 or the 12-820, so someone else will have to give you feedback 
about how they all compare.  The one that really stands out (in not a good way) from the 
other hackables is the new 12-469.  It has an annoying click-click- clicking, which some 
can easily tune out and others cannot.  I have it, as well as the old version 12-469, and old 
12-470.

For manual radio sweep (turning the dial back and forth yourself), I like to use the Duracell 
KP028.  It comes in a 2-pack for around $30, including shipping from places like Amazon 
and eBay.  You might be able to find them in a local store.  I got mine from Costco.  Not 
sure if they have those in your area or not.  I've had better results with this unit than I have 
any of the shack hacks, though I still find the hacks fun to play with.  

Others feel they have had better results with the hacks as compared to manual sweep.  Not 
sure if it has to do with the model of radio they are using or not.  I have tried multiple 
manual sweep units, and that is how I came to like the Duracell as my favorite so far.  I 
also like the Durapro emergency radio, but the thumb dial gives me blisters!

I guess it's just like digital recorders ... one person can get great EVP with a certain make 
and model, while another person will get nothing with it.  LOL - for me, the Olympus I 
have seems to be like that.  I've never had much luck with it.

OK, time for me to hit the sack.  

Margaret
