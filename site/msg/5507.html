&gt; It&#x27;s really wild that you mention john lennon because I recieved a
message from him today.
&gt; I was about to post it when I read your post.

&gt; Bruce, Frank R., since I feel like this all got started
somehowbecause of me, let me just say that I think a lot of what we
werecollectively arguing about may be semantics. We&#x27;re all agreed
aboutpursuing this research in a positive frame of mind. If you have
anaturally positive one, or if you need to do something ritualistic
toremind yourself that you are in a positive mindset, it really
doesn&#x27;tmatter. The same end is obtained.We&#x27;re all okay, no matter
which waywe get to the positive vibe. As John Lennon said, &quot;Whatever
gets youthrough the night, its alright.&quot;You&#x27;re both splendid
researchers and you are both right, HMO.Ann--- In

&gt; No problem, you are entitled to your perspective and opinion.
Ireally don&#x27;t see anywhere in my post, a stance being made beside
myagreeing with Sumption. Since you mentioned it, I have a problem
withpeople who consider themselves to be advanced researchers in
ITCtelling others that there are things you need protection from in
thisfield. I have seen this fear mongering over the many years I have
beeninvolved with my research and the research of colleagues
andassociates and it has never helped anyone. Are there negative
entitiesout there that want to influence you and distract you? Sure
there are!Probably just as many who want to help you and they have
been theresince the beginning of each of our lives.&gt; &gt; The rule of
thumb in dealing with those negative forces is to notfollow their
messages. If the message is basically negative then giveit no merit
and carry on. No ritual needed! Now if you wantcredentials I can give
you my &quot;paranormal resume&quot; and let the pissingcontest begin. All you
need to know about me is I know enough to knowthat the more I learn
and experience the more I realize I have a lotto learn. Ego you say,
not at all. &gt; &gt; Best regards,&gt; &gt; Frank R.&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message

read&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank,&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me say at the
onset this is not meant as an attack and I will not &gt; &gt; get into a
pissing match over it, but I did feel I needed to address &gt; &gt; it.&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; I promised myself that I would not post a response to any one &gt; &gt;
person,only to a subject in general, but I will have to break that &gt; &gt;
promise on this one.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think your response to the ritual
protection post was egotistical, &gt; &gt; careless and uninformed. That was
the response I would expect from a &gt; &gt; close minded sceptic that had
no real experience in this field.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a researcher in the
paranormal in general you should know that &gt; &gt; there is a very real
and present danger from darker entities, &gt; &gt; especially in the field
of box research that is still in its infancy &gt; &gt; and our knowledge is
not advanced enough using this method to be so &gt; &gt; hap hazard about
it.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All are entitled to their own opinion as far as the way
they go about &gt; &gt; their own research but to advise that protection
from the negative &gt; &gt; means nothing and to do it in an open forum
where there are &gt; &gt; impressionable new individuals that are just
entering into this &gt; &gt; research is very careless on your part.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
Some researchers here including Steve and myself among other have &gt; &gt;
recorded files with messages that tell us that the communication &gt; &gt;
process is being hindered at that time by what we refer to as &gt; &gt;
&quot;dark heads&quot; and our spirit contacts actually use that term. they &gt; &gt;
have also told us when asked why communication was so bad that it was
&gt; &gt; being blocked by negative entities. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I only one of a few
that have gotten this exact communication. So &gt; &gt; there is a real
threat from negative energy or entities.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Plus through research
we have found that it is possible for entities &gt; &gt; to travel back and
forth between our realms during an open box &gt; &gt; session. If you
listened to numerous files Steve and I have posted &gt; &gt; asking our
friends mike and Lisa on the other side to insure that all &gt; &gt; and any
spirits that may have traveled through please go back and &gt; &gt; have
gotten conformation from them every time.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is possible for
an entity to travel through the portal that a &gt; &gt; box MAY produce then
it stands to reason it is possible that it can &gt; &gt; be a dark entity.&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as fear goes, I agree wholeheartedly, fear definitely
feeds &gt; &gt; the negative. And that is my point. The protection ritual
does not &gt; &gt; create a relative tangible barrier, it is simply a
metaphoric symbol &gt; &gt; of putting your mind in the right place so as
not to feed this &gt; &gt; negative energy.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the protection we
receive from our tech/guides on the other side &gt; &gt; in my belief is
very real, I believe they do actually run &gt; &gt; interference for us as
far as negativity goes and the part of the &gt; &gt; ritual where we invoke
their help is just a form of respect and &gt; &gt; acknowledgement that they
are constantly watching out for us.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this being said, Of course
everyone will adhere to their own beliefs &gt; &gt; as far as this subject
is concerned. I just felt that your response &gt; &gt; was a little strong
and came more from the attitude that I also &gt; &gt; suffer from that is to
say &quot; negative spirit yeah bring it on&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But that is not a
logical thought out approach to an existing concern.&gt; &gt; So make the
ritual available for anyone that wants to use it and the &gt; &gt;
experienced information to go with it.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My most important
concern is the welfare and teaching and eventual &gt; &gt; success of new
researcher and this research as a whole.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
