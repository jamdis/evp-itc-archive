&gt; I am coming to notice also that if you do not address a direct 
question, they seem to dance around giving you an answer.

really want to communicate with. As you may have notices from the 
previous discussion, I don&#x27;t tend to worry about negative forces. I 
worry more about simple human/nonhuman identity thieves. Hell, Lance--
it&#x27;s all in the phrasing, isn&#x27;t? If I want to hear from my Nanny, I&#x27;d 
like it to be my Nanny, thank you very much. And woe betide any 
alien/idiot human/whatever who tries to mess with me. ;)

&gt;           Hey Ann,
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m totally on the same page about finding out the truth, whatever 
it 
&gt; may be. I know there are tricksters. Native Americans call them 
&gt; Coyote or Skinwalkers. 
&gt; 
&gt; From the clear voices and degree of two-way dialog, for me it&#x27;s 
&gt; simply about getting straight answers. I&#x27;m planning to try and be 
&gt; rigorous about testing any spirits or whatever they are before 
&gt; proceeding. The last thing I wish to do is entertain some demon or 
&gt; entity that is all about lying and half-truths.

&gt; &gt; But it must raise questions, mustn&#x27;t it, Bruce? Who are these 
&gt; &gt; entities we are talking to and why would it be such a problem for 
&gt; us 
&gt; &gt; to know who they were in life? If these are dead humans, it can&#x27;t 
&gt; see 
&gt; &gt; how it would make any difference at all. In fact, to me, being 
&gt; able 
&gt; &gt; to talk about human things with them is rather the only way to 
&gt; prove 
&gt; &gt; that they are dead humans. It does concern me that these entities 
&gt; are 
&gt; &gt; not human, not because I would particularly care if they were 
&gt; &gt; extraterrestrial or extradimentional and just admitted that, but 
&gt; &gt; because my personal desire is to talk to people like me who have 
&gt; &gt; crossed over.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Can you ask them to give you some sort of reason why they can&#x27;t 
&gt; tell 
&gt; &gt; you more about themselves?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, my 2 cents. I know that my line of inquiry with the box is 
&gt; &gt; going to be directed at people who have crossed. Maybe I&#x27;ll get 
&gt; some 
&gt; &gt; answers of my own shortly.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; What I get from mike &amp; Lisa when I ask personal questions about 
&gt; &gt; &gt; them is a reluctant answer at best.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have already thought to ask all of the questions you mention 
&gt; and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; more and have been answered with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;NO&quot; &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; and things like &quot;Wait&quot; so I&#x27;m assuming that they 
&gt; are 
&gt; &gt; &gt; either not allowed or are not ready for me to find
&gt; &gt; &gt; out about their physical lives. I also get the impression that 
&gt; they 
&gt; &gt; &gt; want to remain as separate entities in my mind
&gt; &gt; &gt; and if I where to know who and what they where in the physical 
&gt; it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; would reduce them to a lower level of spirituality
&gt; &gt; &gt; in my mind. that is the general jist of the messages as far as 
&gt; that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; subject goes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Comments for Bruce
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rambling thoughts:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The sound quality was not as good with this batch. Lots more
&gt; &gt; &gt; background. Did you change anything?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay--I am completely fascinated with who these people are who 
&gt; talk
&gt; &gt; &gt; to us. I have two, both male, and god knows who they really are,
&gt; &gt; &gt; because one has changed identity at least six times over the 
&gt; years,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and one won&#x27;t tell anything at all about himself. Period. Oh, 
he 
&gt; says
&gt; &gt; &gt; that he won&#x27;t talk through the box either. I&#x27;m tempted to 
add, &quot;So
&gt; &gt; &gt; there&quot; as a direct quote. LOL. Anyway, Mike and Lisa-- So Mike 
&gt; says
&gt; &gt; &gt; he bled to death in &#x27;95; Lisa choked to death in the 1920s and 
&gt; nuts
&gt; &gt; &gt; to you for asking, apparently. ;)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Would you ask them some questions for me?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask Mike which &#x27;95 he died in--1995 or 1895?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask Lisa what her favorite perfume was.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask them both more biographical questions, such as where the 
were
&gt; &gt; &gt; born, lived, and died. Their full names. Their spouses&#x27; names, 
&gt; kids,
&gt; &gt; &gt; etc. I&#x27;m a historian/geneologist and I think it would be a 
blast 
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; look in available records to try to identify them.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask them the year of their birth. If they tell you, there&#x27;s a 
lot 
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; historical questions I love to ask about events within their 
&gt; &gt; &gt; lifetimes.
