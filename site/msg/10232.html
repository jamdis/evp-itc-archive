<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>hey guy&#x27;s,

I posted a number of files yesterday from my last EVP maker 
allophones session. and received not one response.

I think this is due to the overwhelming amount of posts that are 
being written and files posted to this group.

The files that are posted, not just mine but all are important to the 
research and deserve to be heard and commented on by all.

My thoughts are that this group is not just a place to post research 
results and posts pertaining to the technical and aspect and 
advancement of this research, but has become a social forum in some 
ways where small insignificant posts are tending to push other posts 
and file announcements to the back pages of the message area.

Also members personal e-mail is getting so cluttered with posts every 
day that most do not have the time, patience or strength to review 
each one and I know when I open a post be it here or in my e-mail and 
the first couple of words have nothing or little to do with research 
or are repetitious of ten other posts. I simply hit the  delete 
button and the post goes unread.

I know we all everyone, put a lot of time and work into our research 
and when it falls through the cracks without even being presented for 
comment, it gets disheartening.

Maybe we should start a group for social and casual discussion 
amongst members and have this one for hard research posts.
That way one does not conflict with the other.

I know I sound like sour grapes, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one to 
feel this way.

And I know the comments will come that no one has time to read all 
the posts or respond to all the files. I know all of this.

There is more to be said and more idea&#x27;s on how to make the whole 
issue more amicable for everyone.

I just want to get initial reaction first.
