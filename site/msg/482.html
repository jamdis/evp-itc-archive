Hi Frank,
This person first said that she heard no EVP from you and then said that the lower spirits were messing with you.  Contradiction, debunking or no. I don't pay attention to people who say they can read your vibes--ridiculous- -some of the vibes they've "read" have been only to serve themselves, as we all know.  I also understand how you would want to continue the interaction- -I would, too, if I found myself in a similar predicament.  I try not to go there, although it has happened.  Keep us posted.

 Well, Im not sure if this person is an actual debunker, if its just a personal attack. One of the other members of Grass harp, who was also a member here, thought she could judge and attack others by the vibes she got from them. I ripped into this person for being so egotistical and arrogant, and IO think this Alice that is attacking now might be doing so out of revenge. Not being one to back away form an argument, I kinda keep it going, no doubt wrongly.

Hi Frank and Andrea,
I completely agree, Andrea.  I think we also need to keep in mind that certain methods and technological devices will work for some and not for others, especially if there is a "debunker mentality" going on, but even if there is not.  For example, the Spiricom device has not worked very well for any others who have tried it since its inception; according to Mark Macy, all they have managed to get are very simple EVP, which we all have gotten from our digital or analog voice recorders.  The Scole Experiment people have said that debunkers inhibit the interaction, so why have them around or bother with them?
There is also the "medium" theory, which many researchers claim is necessary to successful communication.  I don't consider myself a medium in the current sense of the term, but I guess I am in that I receive some pretty good EVP at times, while others try and try and receive nothing. 
I don't get discouraged if I try a method that has worked well for others, in the past or currently, and it doesn't work for me.  After all, it's all about our etheric communicators and how they can communicate with us as individuals.  Let the debunkers have their say and we can continue on with our research, right?  Vicki

Like I said I have seen & listened to your box live and heard your guys say Purple Princess directly off the box without it being analyzed-this was not put in a program when I heard it they just came out and said it clear as day. I knew it was your guys too because they have a different sound to them then when the spirits Chris was talking to spoke. IMHO if the debunkers dont want to believe they lose out as youre willing to share something that was supposed to be made and you actually did it & I dont care if you got help to make the box-you made it and it works!!!!!

I'd say that would be your best bet at this point.
