Did you ever consider there are people who watch and learn ...not to make a=
nyone paranoid.  Maybe they will talk to me too & I am not messing with any=
one here. Just saying I watch these discussions and I am not a skeptic & ne=
ver have been but no wonder they get pissy.

  Perhaps a compromise to these opinions is to consider that there are many=
 devices, processes, and theories as to what works, what doesn't, what it d=
oes, and how it does it.

  Here, I was focusing on one item (the box Frank=
 has lent out to be tested), and the claim Frank has for the box:

  "The F=
rank's box allows entities to use FM and AM radio broadcast as raw material=
, which these entities select and shape to communicate with the user. The m=
essages received are for the user, and rarely does anyone hear the same thi=
ng as the original listener."'

  And with a proposed definition of entity =
as: "Intelligent communication from entities who are not living human being=
s".

  Note this suggests a couple interesting tests, such as how rare or c=
ommon is it for others to hear the same thing, and under what conditions.

 the "impression" is not as "clean" and one has to develop "an ear" so to s=
