Just make sure YOU arent paying for the website bandwith on that idea LOL. Sounds great though. A bit like http://www.dxzone.com/catalog/Internet_and_Radio/Online_Receivers/
  with all thier online radio hams broadcasting over the ineternet but with a franks box spin on it. In most of them multiple users can tune in at the same time to whats going on..its who has control of the radio that is the problem when diff people want to listen to diff things. 
   
  I say go for it, we know they can modulate the sound on each users end so theres no reason why people shouldnt get results and responses. Ive heard them use online radios for contact recently, by modulating the sound being broadcast. They use peoples names so there is no doubting its being used to communicate.

What about multiple boxes?

Just imagine, a box accessible to the world 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week! It staggers the imagination! Given the nature of the voices and 
contacts, I wouldn't be surprised if several people could access the system 
at the exact same time, yet all receive personal communications.

Guess that would create wee ripple in the darkside!!

I wasn't sure if the originator of the idea wanted his name out there, I 
took it off.
