<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I forgot to mention this in my previous posts, but I&#x27;m looking for
suggestions. I recently had a big problem with my heart chakra being
clogged and all, but I managed to take care of it, but I&#x27;m still not
getting enough chakra to the 3rd eye and crown chakras. Does anyone
know of a frequency selection that might help me with the movement of
this chakra?

&gt; I&#x27;d like to introduce myself.. and share this information with the
group here in the hopes that some members may have an interest in
participating in an experimental research project.
&gt; 
&gt; Im looking for people who are willing to participate in our online
experiment and can provide input, feedback and comparison on some of
the various digital frequency files we are using.
&gt; 
&gt; After many years of researching, on going development and testing
our current experimental group of approximately 2000 volunteers have
been witness to some really unusual and intense phenomena playing
out... bordering on the supra-normal. We&#x27;re seeing rapid, profound
effects on the body and mind occuring via this new acoustic frequency
tool.
&gt; 
&gt; Specifically, one of the areas we are focusing on now and are hoping
to collect more data on are the effects on the mind and body from the
use of
&gt; frequencies designed to entrain the body and mind towards those
states conducive to the experience of ascension and the manifestation
of desired positive change.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently released new &#x27;frequency&#x27; protoypes that our group has
been testing and their reports of the results they have been
experiencing have been staggering.
&gt; 
&gt; Implications currently, are for enormous  potential improvements for
health and wellness as well as rapid change from challenging mind and
emotional states to ones of increased vitality, increased performance
and increased well being and balance.
&gt; 
&gt; One possible and very real application of this may be to address
both general and specific aspects of health issues.  For example one
of our members experimented with effects on the blood , had an
independent lab analyze his blood sample and it seems like there was a
dramatic change in the bloods terrain!
&gt; 
&gt; Data collected to date on reaction responses have been over the top
&gt; favourable.....
&gt; 
&gt; We are finding that actual &#x27;things&#x27; are happening, when these
frequencies are simply played. Very noticeable and dramatic effects
and changes in the body, mind and environment - unlike anything
induced by any other sound (that we know of).  many people who
experimented on these frequencies report that they are unlike other
existing technologies such as binaural beats.
&gt; 
&gt; What we need right now however, are more volunteers who are willing
to test out our other frequencies and keep a log of their findings and
report their observations to our group. There is no cost required for
testing frequencies, the primary benefit to my group and I is the
collection of data.... the benefit to you, well... once you see what
we are engaged in, I think you will be more than satisfied with the
experience.....
&gt; 
&gt; Two things important here, one is to share with you the observations
of our
&gt; group in their process of discovery in relation to the health
related frequency track - the thought being, that you are likely to
not only find this intrinsically interesting and newsworthy but also
inspiring. The second is to provide you with a means of facilitating
your own journey through this phenomena in the hopes you can share
your own unique findings with us.
&gt; 
&gt; Feel free to view a recent post on our research forum that details
how to access this information and also various frequency tracks you
can download.

&gt; 
&gt; Examples of recent reports by users ;
&gt; 
&gt; “I am struck with the effects that sound has on the physical
structure. That is, especially in the subtle tissues like neurons and
synapses. Case in point, I don&#x27;t hesitate in expressing myself just
the way it comes out. No coloring, no bravado, no bullshit....the
endorphine level in the body went way up. I have noted from my initial
listening of this freq. is that it appears to synchronize the 2
hemispheres of the brain and thought became markedly coherent. ..
perhaps the feeling of increased endorphine flow could be an actual
increase in neuro- transmitter presence, particularly seratonin.... As
things ended I was left with this feeling of balance and well being. I
definitely want to work with this sequence more. It seems to be the
right one for me currently. I probably want to post this explanation
on the Yahoo site. I&#x27;ll be sending my initial impressions in another
email to you shortly. Thanks again for this amazing opportunity.”
&gt; 
&gt; “This morning I listened to kindle mind set, I have had family in
and had not used the fequencies for a week. The first sensations were
an extreme energy from my hands I am a Reiki Master but the energy and
heat I felt was more than I had experienced before.There was a
bubbling feeling inside my chest their was intense tingling of my
chest and torso, a sensual, sexual feel.My arms legs and feet were
extremely warm, I am usually cold. It felt like my blood was
bubbling.I had an effervesce feeling in my mouth. My feet tingled and
as I nwas laying on the chaise listening, I closed my eyes and was
enjoying a full color animated video like p roduction without sound.
This is first time I have seen anything other than a magenta colored
flower.I listened to kindle set for about 3 hours. I have Bose
speakers on the computer I used this morning.”
