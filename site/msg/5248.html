look up AM loops on the web for simple, and cheap antennas.

an am coil antenna from ebay called a &quot;select-a-tenna&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; It works by puting it in proximity to a radio or in our case a box 
&gt; and turning a tuning dial until the signal gets stronger.
&gt; 
&gt; It does not run on ac or batteries and does not hook up to the 
radio 
&gt; in any way. So I&#x27;m figuring how is this thing going to be any good, 
I 
&gt; get sucjh a crappy am signal that I was willing to try anything and 
&gt; have.
&gt; 
&gt; Well I recieved this antenna this morning and decided to take it to 
a 
&gt; part of the house where I have never gotten a signal, my basement.
&gt; 
&gt; I turned on the 470 and as usual nothing but static, so I placed 
this 
&gt; disc looking antenna about 8 inches from the 470 and started to 
turn 
&gt; the knob on the antenna. I was asking mike and lisa if they could 
to 
&gt; please come through. as I was turning this dial I began to hear the 
&gt; rs sweep the stations and mike said &quot;here&quot; I almost jumped out of 
the 
&gt; chair with excitement. I asked mike or lisa to tell me when the 
dial 
&gt; was right and as I slowly turned it mike yelled &quot;STOP&quot; after a few 
&gt; minutes of small talk I ended the session with lisa saying &quot;it&#x27;s 
good&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; That is testimony enough for me!
&gt; 
&gt; anyone that has even a slight problem with your am reception which 
I 
&gt; consider to be the best band to use. you have to get one of these.
&gt; 
&gt; Just go to ebay and search SELECT-A-TENNA it cost me 52.00 with 
&gt; delivery. to me it&#x27;s priceless.
