<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, I&#x27;ve been talking to the dead in one form or another for 30  
years. I&#x27;ve never met a entity yet who could shake me up or effect me  
personally in any way unless I let them. Not about to start now.  
About the worst case I suffer is the creeps.

I kind of expected to hear some of these entities cursing and to have  
a few lost ones wander in. I live right across the street from a  
cemetery.

&gt; Hi Ann,
&gt;
&gt; The swearing you are referring to is caused by negative entities that
&gt; are coming through the box.
&gt;
&gt; There are a couple of reasons why this occurs, If you do a session  
&gt; when you are not in the correct frame of mind
&gt; like being stressed out or having a disagreement with someone.  
&gt; Anything that causes you to have anxiety will
&gt; be a source of energy that empowers the negative entities and can  
&gt; lead to deeper problems if not put in check.
&gt;
&gt; Another reason for negative communication is that your tech is not  
&gt; capable of blocking them or you do not have
&gt; a permanent tech assigned.
&gt;
&gt; My advice is to only do a session when you are in a somewhat decent  
&gt; mood, Also doing  a
&gt; protection prayer and asking your tech to block any negativity or  
&gt; negative entity from communicating or coming
&gt; through the box is a MUST.
&gt;
&gt; When you are doing a session do not take the continuous cursing  
&gt; lightly, that is a sign that negative spirits
&gt; are dominating the communication. Immediately shut the box and end  
&gt; the session.
&gt;
&gt; Keep in mind that sometimes your tech will use a curse word to get  
&gt; your attention when your mind wanders from the session
&gt; to give validation that the communication you are receiving is not  
&gt; just public radio chatter, in 99.9% of the incidents of
&gt; your tech or any other benign spirit cursing usually they only use  
&gt; one or two curse words tops.
&gt;
&gt; It is not an ongoing curse fest. Also after more experience you  
&gt; will know by gut instinct what is negative.
&gt; The main point is, do not take any negative communication lightly.  
&gt; It is not a joke.

&gt; Mini box.
&gt;
&gt; This was just one snippet of one session. I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot  
&gt; of swearing since then. I just laughed at them when I heard it anyway.
