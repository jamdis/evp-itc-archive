Maybe we can set up specific location=
s and dates across the US (and in
other countries for people here from outs=
ide the US) for general
meet-ups. Call it "boxapalooza on tour", or whateve=
r you want. Have
a meet-up on the west coast, the Midwest, the east coast, =
etc. Ego's
and "names" checked at the door, etc.

There's also the option o=
f regular city specific monthly meetings as
well. Similar to how the hacker=
/tech magazine 2600 has user
groups/meetups -
