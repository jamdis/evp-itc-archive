the fact!




 I did, from the begining open this to anyone, and I am not a=
mused that one person would take the technogoly, claim it as his own, and a=
ttempt to make it exclusive to himself. For one person to say he is the "pr=
imary tester" is inaccurate, he was the first that kinda understood how it =
was supposed to be used, or so I thought. I think we left the "treting phas=
e" some time ago, perhaps it's time to return barrowed equipment?  I wasn't=
 quite finished with that e-mail-- I hit the send button in my rush to get =
off to work.     I put out a box use guideline thing a year or two ago stat=
ing that no one has the right to take my equipment and and claim their use =
supercedes anyones else's use, or results. So, to contiue...  As a far as "=
technicians" I don't get any of that stuff, but---they do talk about a netw=
ork, and connection to our equipment. When I first made my "Ghostman" box, =
last week, it wasn't working well, but a day or so later, it came to life, =
and one of the voices said it had been connected to "the network". Supposed=
ly there is a similar connection made to computers running EVPmaker. I'm no=
t sure if these "network" connections are maintained if equipment is taken =
out for investigations, or demostrations. Of cousre, I can't say if these n=
etworks are a fact. I would think as maker of the box, these etheric techs =
might want to give me, or others some hints.  As far as the ghost box, or F=
rank's box, being a "telephone to the dead", I think is very poor analogy, =
the old style phone system of Edison's day had operators, plural, not one p=
erson that recieved all calls, then interpreted what was being said to othe=
r parties. That's more of a master control schema.The old phone system didn=
't charge you an arm and a leg to talk to someone in the same room either! =
Some might say these "Technicains" are the operators, but even if anyone es=
le could hear these voices, why do you need someone to interpret what's bei=
ng said. I say if not many can hear it, or something similar, it ain't real=
! There is a certain kind of conatct, ion that that your own mind uses the =
noise as a sort of psychic prop, you hear the stuff in your head, it may be=
 accurate and real inforamntiion, but no one else is going to hear it. i th=
ink that what all this supposed converstions wiht Edison maybe.  I have in =
fact heard a voice that said "Edison here" but there was no other real info=
rmation conveyed that I could understand.  As for portals, demons and evil =
spirits entering the world through these "unauthorized" boxes, I an only sa=
y, as the original mker of the box, I have gotten voices cuzzing, swearing,=
 name calling, and even threatening, but nothing that has seemingly "entere=
d" our world. Even those "threatening entities", when pressed to bring it, =
fold up like paper tigers. These beings and spirits already exist all aroun=
d us, and at a higher level, so they have full access to this, a lower leve=
r. Besides. There is that "network" that seem to allow for better contacts,=
 and kinda helps highter being to come through.   I made these "boxes"! The=
 idea was not "Edisons Telephone..." What I got was an assemblage of my own=
 expereince and knowlegde, put together by my own mind as answer to my ques=
tion of what else could I use for spirit comuncation. All technology involv=
ed was based on what I had worked on in the past for radio experimentation.=
 I had in fact, a couple years before my interest in EVP, been experimentin=
g with voltage tunable radio modules removed from car stereos for AM DX, th=
at's listening to distant AM radio stations. I was hoping to find other tal=
k shows similar to Art Bell, and there used to be one out of Cincinati(?). =
The idea of using a random voltage to tune the radio was after using EVPmak=
er, which uses a method of generating random speech bits for the entities t=
o use. It was a small leap to apply the random technique to an anolog syste=
m. I am not the first to be focusing on a problem, and have the mind provid=
e an solution in complete form. Nothing mystical about it. The fact is, aft=
er much work, and experimenting, the tuning doesn't have to be random, a li=
near tuning works much better. Yet another fact of  the box, covienently ig=
nored.  What really chaps my hide, as maker of the box, is to have someone,=
 who knows nothing of electronics, and technology completely ignore everyth=
ing I say about the box, and presume to tell me how it really works, how it=
 should be used, and what is acceptable from it. This guy is so honest, he =
won't even use his real name, but huff and puff at at anyone that contradic=
ts his use of my equipment. I say, as "a Tester" if you can't use it in an =
honest manor, bring the stuff back--testing over! Like it or not, the publi=
c has this technology, you can keep pissing and moaning, trying to spread f=
ear, or you could choose the way of Light.   Frank-S
