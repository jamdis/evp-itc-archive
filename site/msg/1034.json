The random tuning voltage being derived from \nwhite noise. For the newer linear tuning, the voltage is only a triangle \nwave with a very slow frequency, like .3 hz. It turns out, you don&#39;t need \nrandom, and maybe a steady tuing rate is better, as in tuning the radio \nacross the band by hand. I think all that is required is broken up audio \nthat can be rearranged. This stuff seems to defy theory, and definition, \njust when you think you have it figured out, it seems to work in a different \nmanor. Maybe it&#39;s just supposed to make us nuts, an open our minds up in \nthat way?\n\nThere&#39;s a reason I give my stuff away, cuz I don&#39;t want to go down that road \nof needing to make more money, even if just to pay for parts. I&#39;m sure it \nwould start out good, but the darkness of the soul would creep up, demanding \na bigger cut. I&#39;m sure that one user of my boxes feels justified in his \nactions, almost as if he&#39;s doing god&#39;s work, but I still feel like I&#39;ve been \nabused.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMortgage refinance is Hot. *Terms.
