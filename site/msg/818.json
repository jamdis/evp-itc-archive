It&#39;s been my expereince if you try to wake too many up, or put out \nwhat is percieved as good, or light energy, you get these darkside \nreactions. I learned first hand you don&#39;t try to fill an area with positve \nenergy, or try to drive out all the demons, the consequences can be deadly \nas you get a darkside reaction. An Italian researcher thought he would have \na group focus on a small area in Italy to see if conditions could be \nimproved, the result, that giant quake in Afkanistan, I think it was \ndirectly related. I tried to surround Denver with a &quot;shield&quot; of white light, \nyears ago, and a whole family was beaten to death with a hammer that night. \nYa have to be really careful, cuz innocents die as a result. I wouldn&#39;t be \nsurprised if loss of my son wasn&#39;t karma.  Maybe I&#39;m thinking too much......\n\nI&#39;m not in a huge hurry to get the site back up, I think I need to meditate \non this for awhile.\n\nFrank\n\n\n&gt;From: LON3_S7AR &lt;lon3_s7ar@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] My site is gone!\n&gt;Date: Tue, 6 Mar 2007 21:39:27 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;\n&gt;hummmmmm\n&gt;   i would contact them\n&gt;   sounds like people making complaints to them and getting you booted\n&gt;   stupid!\n&gt;   what the heck kids of tos would get you booted?lol\n&gt;   a ghost clause?\n&gt;   lol\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nThe average US Credit Score is 675.
