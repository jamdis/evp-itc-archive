<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Dual supply, linear sweep, treble-bass filter, audio amps. *Tuner is a
separate board*, so this layout is not dependent on what tuner is available.
Me thinks I am vastly underestimated. Cellphone camera--crappy! Dual
supply=it needs  + and - 12 volts to function. Two 12 volts supplies--two
8-AA battery packs or two 12V gel cells, or NiMh packs--or what ever.

 BTW, I have a random sweep board too, the boards are designed to stack  :-)
and no, I can&#x27;t mass produce these either. But... 3 boards for $85 from
ExpressPCB, solder mask and silk screened, just add components and shake.
There&#x27;s a few SMT resistors and caps, but that&#x27;s pretty easy.  PBCs are
easy, the only hold up is tuners. 1/8th watt resistors and standard caps can
be used in the tone section. I know, about impossible to see. Tuners are the
problem. Thios was designed to be used wiht car tuners, but any tuner will
work. There is a three input mixer section that combines the left and right
stereo channels, and an AM channel from a seperate tuner if needed. But
wait, there&#x27;s more, it has the mic amp for the echo chamber as well. One
would have to supply all components, controls and switches. This is not a
simple project.

 Chris Moon&#x27;s latest box is done with the PCBs and a RS Arm Band tuner, his
daughter&#x27;s uses a car tuner with the same PCBs. It&#x27;s two years old. Not the
first printed boards I have done.

 I usually do perf board and point to point wiring to save money. I should
be doing kits or something.

 FYI, the tone control I found on the web, just so you are aware when some
one tries to bootleg the boards. Ripping off someone&#x27;s designs may have
consequences-that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t sell these, paying royalties reduces my
labor profit from 5 cents an hour to 2 cents an hour.

 The point is, *if you have tuners*, excess money, and want a spiffy looking
box, you can have PCBs made.

 Sooooo, at the risk of everyone wanting to order these----I can&#x27;t take
orders for PCBs, I don&#x27;t have the tuners, and I don&#x27;t have the $$$$$$ extra
for boards.  The boxes I sold for very reduced prices at Rolling Hills is
what financed these boards. I don&#x27;t make any money on boxes, I barely get
enough to buy parts, and labor? Forget about it.

Dual supply, linea sweep, eble-bass il e , audio amps. Tune is a sepa a e boa d, so his layou is no dependen on wha une is a ailable. Me hinks I am as ly unde es ima ed. Cellphone came a--c appy! Dual supply=i needs  + and - 12 ol s o unc ion. Two 12 ol s supplies-- wo 8-AA ba e y packs o wo 12V gel cells, o NiMh packs--o wha e e . 

 
 BTW, I ha e a andom sweep boa d oo, he boa ds a e designed o s ack  :-) and no, I can&#x27; mass p oduce hese ei he . Bu ... 3 boa ds o $85 om Exp essPCB, solde  mask and silk sc eened, jus add componen s and shake. The e&#x27;s a ew SMT esis o s and caps, bu ha &#x27;s p e y easy.  PBCs a e easy, he only hold up is une s. 1/8 h wa esis o s and s anda d caps can be used in he one sec ion. I know, abou impossible o see. Tune s a e he p oblem. Thios was designed o be used wih ca une s, bu any une will wo k. The e is a h ee inpu mixe sec ion ha combines he le and igh s e eo channels, and an AM channel om a sepe a e une i needed. Bu wai , he e&#x27;s mo e, i has he mic amp o he echo chambe as well. One would ha e o supply all componen s, con ols and swi ches. This is no a simple p ojec . 

 
 Ch is Moon&#x27;s la es box is done wi h he PCBs and a RS A m Band une , his daugh e &#x27;s uses a ca une wi h  he same PCBs. I &#x27;s wo yea s old. No he i s p in ed boa ds I ha e done. 
 
 I usually do pe boa d and poin o poin wi ing o sa e money. I should be doing ki s o some hing. 
 
 FYI, he one con ol I ound on he web, jus so you a e awa e when some one ies o boo leg he boa ds. Ripping o someone&#x27;s designs may ha e consequences- ha &#x27;s why I don&#x27; sell hese, paying oyal ies educes my labo p o i om 5 cen s an hou o 2 cen s an hou .

 
 The poin is, i you ha e une s, excess money, and wan a spi y looking box, you can ha e PCBs made. 
 
 Sooooo, a he isk o e e yone wan ing o o de hese----I can&#x27; ake o de s o PCBs, I don&#x27; ha e he une s, and I don&#x27; ha e he $$$$$$ ex a o boa ds.  The boxes I sold o e y educed p ices a Rolling Hills is wha inanced hese boa ds. I don&#x27; make any money on boxes, I ba ely ge enough o buy pa s, and labo ? Fo ge abou i .
