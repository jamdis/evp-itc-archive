<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Oh.. ok, that&#x27;s funny because that explains what those other spirits 
on that same recording were talking about. It&#x27;s just amazing when can 
pick up those conversations they are having between themselves in 
these recordings sometimes.... but good that your group is keeping 
close eye on who&#x27;s allowed in and who&#x27;s not!

&gt; The undertaker one was pretty clear for everyone I think. Even 
hubby can hear that one. What does it mean? Well for me it meant just 
because they are dead doesnt mean they have lost thier senses of 
humor. He almost got kicked out by the guides for that smarta$$ 
remark until the others came to his defense and said he means no 
harm. A few understood why he said it... they have the same sick 
sense of humor LOL

&gt; &gt; Heres a few from a recent session I am sharing with the group. I 
&gt; recently bumped into one of the names they have been mentioning and 
I 
&gt; thought they meant someone who passed. Then I run across someone 
with 
&gt; the same name who is becoming involved in the ITC field of study. 
So 
&gt; I asked my group there why they have expressed such an interest in 
&gt; him. Someone (alive) mentioned it&#x27;s because he is into studying 
&gt; reverse speech and has trained his ears to hear it. I have to agree 
&gt; he definitely hears things out of my ranges, and his methods 
totally 
&gt; differ from my own. They only gave me a few clear answers to my 
&gt; question and one of them is the first attached file. Hope you can 
&gt; hear it easily because for me it is very clear. Probably one of the 
&gt; clearest so far. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The rest of the attachments are other entities who popped in the 
&gt; conversation and some of thier chat was directed at each other. As 
&gt; for the a-hole thing on the last part when it mentioned other 
mouths 
&gt; to talk I had a flashback of Ace Ventura bending over making his 
butt 
&gt; cheeks talk, I dont know why but I found it funny. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yes sometimes they argue amongst themselves, or bump into 
&gt; entities they know and carry on conversations.

&gt; Just heard that undertaker recording of your Misty -- very clear! I 
&gt; wonder what it means?
