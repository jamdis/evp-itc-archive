Jeremy:        IF you are unable to find an old 470 and you dont care for the clicking on the 69, why don't you try the 20-125?  This has the internal speaker and you can hack that as well.  I believe Steve has directions on his site, keyportparanormal.com.
   
  Good luck!

Hell, I've been trying my best to locate an older 12-470 to modify so
I could start doing the research. I know there is the 12-469, but
I've been hesitant because of all the talk about the annoying click.
