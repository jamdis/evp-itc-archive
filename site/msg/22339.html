<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Digging more myself, I found this on a JREF Forum:

&quot;Jose Alvarez is listed as a secretary working an average of 5 hours a week without compensation. &quot;

A far cry from &quot;Co-founder&quot; or &quot;director&quot;.

But then I saw them discussing you at the JREF forum (David Koenig), and that you were a banned member.  So if you have some kind of grudge against the JREF, I suspect any facts I try to post are not going to sit well with you.  So I&#x27;ll end my help at this point.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The group was infiltrated by Jose Alvarez... An illegal alien who was director of the JREF... He has been arrested by the FBI for fraud and identity theft... You can google. For more on the scandal !!!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If by JREF you mean the James Randi Educational Foundation, I googled, and Jose Alvarez was never a JREF director.
