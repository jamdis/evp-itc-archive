Like 031206h.jpg or whatever. I call him the sockpuppet guy because when I recieved it I thought that looked like a big sock puppet he was holding up LOL. \n\nBut yes I used the webcam for those. I dont know why sometimes they are clear and sometimes they are more pixelated. Same as evp never know why its clearer some days than others.\n\nMisty\n\n--- On Tue, 7/22/08, newsurfer34 &lt;newsurfer34@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: newsurfer34 &lt;newsurfer34@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Thanks\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, July 22, 2008, 1:07 PM\n&gt; Thanks for the welcome, Misty.  I saw your photo album on\n&gt; your \n&gt; website.  Those are awesome caps.  Did you only use a\n&gt; webcam for \n&gt; these?  Some of them came out so clearly.  I left a comment\n&gt; on one of \n&gt; them. (031206h)  I think some of yours are more clear than\n&gt; some I have \n&gt; seen using the camcorder and t.v. screen.  How did you get\n&gt; the dots on \n&gt; number 44?  Is there a way to focus in better?"}
