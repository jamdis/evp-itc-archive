Sure. I'll share two links to the same pic, as I'm not sure which way I sho=
uld post it to the group for "clickability". 

In this link you get the who=
le picture - that's the front of my cousin's home:
http://img.photobucket.c=
om/albums/0903/BecPellor/the_pixie.jpg
http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/09=
03/BecPellor/?action=3Dview¤t=3Dthe_pixie.jpg

In this one you'll see=
 it cropped,=A0 closer up:

/picture1.jpg
http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/0903/BecPellor/?action=3Dvi=
ew¤t=3Dpicture1.jpg

This one even closer:

I was stunned when I saw t=
he photo, and then blew it up and looked at it more closely. And like I sai=
d, I saw it *on* the camera, still *on* the memory card myself.=A0 I'm a ho=
bbist photographer/designer, with quite a bit of knowledge about Photoshop/=
etc.=A0 My niece, on the other hand, knows how to point and shoot a camera,=
 and download them to her computer. That's it.=A0 I have had several profes=
sional photographers view it, as well as some of my graphics friends. We al=
l agreed that it was definitely "something to behold!" 

The picture was ta=
ken it was Feb. of 2007, and it was still quite chilly in Florida. In fact,=
 in all the pics you can see my family members with their jackets on! There=
 were no bugs out, etc.=A0 Nothing else out of the ordinary showed up in an=
y of the other photographs, either the ones taken right before this shot, o=
r after this shot, or in the whole trip.

Interesting, isn't it?
