Hi Rita,
   
  There are many methods for recording imagery just as there are many for recording voices. I gave a quick breakdown for a few of them I've used on my page (which still needs updating LOL) and many others have websites built around the subject. I havent had alot of time to spend on it but when I do the results are sometimes worth the wait. I wish I had all day to spend on research when I want to. I'd try alot more things just out of curiousity sake alone along with things they mention.
   
  I dont think I posted any of my pics in the file area, I made the gallery instead. You can view it if you find any of the methods interest you and want to see examples. Ive posted a few hundred there so far. the good, the bad, the "what the heck is that" and the stereogram type. 
   
  Some are whole faces of someone I knew, as for the rest your on your own as to who/what you may or may not see. I need to update that again too and add new stuff LOL
   
  Anyway you can try a few methods and see whats working well for you.
