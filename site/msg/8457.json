I&#39;m at http://www.ITCdeadpeople.com\n\nIt&#39;s a super simple site.  Just five pages.  But page one has a link to some of my EVP which I \nposted on putfile.  And page two has several links:  one for instructions on the water video \nITC technique, one to a Maury segment on youtube where some of my material was used \n(thanks for posting that, Debbie!), and a couple collages of the crystal images.\n\nI hope you like it.  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Margaret, \n&gt;    \n&gt;   What is you sites address?

I was surprised at how much smaller my files became when I changed \nmy \n&gt; settings in Audacity to 16-bit MONO with an 11025Hz sample rate. I figure this is voice \n&gt; we are recording, not the symphony. And in my case, I&#39;m not doing any kind of \nfrequency \n&gt; analysis, or anything else that requires super high quality files. Files, in almost all cases, \n&gt; really do not need to be 32-bit stereo with a 44100Hz sample rate. But I know how \nhard \n&gt; it can be to convince some people of this.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do save my individual raw files on my drive in WAV format. But if I&#39;m going to post, I \n&gt; create an MP3. Even my WAV files are small though. Just took a look, and with my \n&gt; settings, a short WAV file runs about 88kb. Converted to MP3 it becomes just 16kb. I \n&gt; have one that is 248kb in the raw, but after editing out unrelated content and exporting \nto \n&gt; MP3, it was just 24kb. \n&gt; \n&gt; If people would just record with the lower settings to begin with, I think they would be \n&gt; surprised at the amount of quality which remains... not to discount how much of their \nown \n&gt; hard drive space will be saved. I know a 1MB WAV file with the high settings becomes \njust \n&gt; 20kb in MP3 format with the lower settings. \n&gt; \n&gt; I visit another forum where the max file size for a single submission is 150kb. A person \nis \n&gt; physically unable to upload any file larger than that. People have changed to the lower \n&gt; settings in order to meet the file size restriction, and I can tell you that plenty of \nmembers \n&gt; post, and plenty of others hear and understand their examples just fine. Hopefully some \nof \n&gt; the members here will give the lower settings a try. :0)\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; You guys really do have to start using mp3 versions tho we are at 90% full again so its \n&gt; going to come down to either some people wont be allowed to post files if they cant \nmake \n&gt; the transition, or all files will have to be deleted, or nobody will be able to post at all \n&gt; because there will be no space left. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                            \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Looking for last minute shopping deals?
