I am\n&gt; anxious to start ITC-EVP experimentation. I was looking over the\n&gt; photos section. Can someone explain to me what they represent and \nhow\n&gt; and when the photos are taken. What is the procedure?Thanks much to\n&gt; all!Rita \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Connect and share in new ways with Windows Live.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; http://www.windowslive.com/connect.html?\nocid=TXT_TAGLM_Wave2_newways_112007\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
