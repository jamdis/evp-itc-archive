  GP, I =
am glad to see you are here, a friendly face from close by. I am
  also gla=
d to see that this site is not all negative. I had just
  joined last week,=
 and made the post about the Door to the Dead; and
  with all the negative =
post was thinking about leaving this forum. In
  fact I had e-mailed Larry =
privately expressing that thought.

  I have seen a rash of e-mails more up=
 beat so I have gone back to
  individual e-mails from the digest. I think =
I will hang around a
  little longer.

  For other members in Texas, I'm in=
 Houston, just across the channel
  from the Golden Phoenix. I see we are w=
ell represented as a state. I
  am glad to meet all of you.

  Regards,
  J=

  Its all the same "dog and pony" act. =
Since "Ghost Hunters" has become
  a hit "everyone" wants their own tv show=
