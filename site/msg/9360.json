With all the references to air, it makes \nme assume that an &#39;air person&#39; could be the &#39;humans&#39; (as has also been referenced) who \nare using their &#39;air portals&#39; - thereby making us &#39;air people&#39; ... not necessarily that we \nbreath air, which could be the case as well, but I&#39;m sort of leaning toward this term being a \nreference of communication.  \n\nIf we &quot;enter their air&quot; through &quot;air portals&quot; and they &quot;give us air&quot; for communication, I think \nthat makes us &quot;air people&quot; in their frame of reference.  But really, that&#39;s just a guess.  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce or Margaret\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Do you know what is a air person?
