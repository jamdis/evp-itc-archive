We just completed the advance hack on our 469 \nmodel.  Are you supposed to hear the voices from the radio stations or \njust white noise?\n\nAlso, is it best to hook up an external speaker, one or two, in order \nto record to a digital recorder?  What is the best way to record, using \ndigital recorder, or direct into PC using Sound recorder, and using a \nline in/line out connection?\n\nWhat is the recommended length of sessions.  Should I try just a minute \nor two, or longer at one sitting?\n\nThanks to all!\nRita"}
