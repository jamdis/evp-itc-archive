All files listed\n&gt; &gt; in order with numbers much like yahoo group files...clicked on one\n&gt; &gt; file...wainted a bit and the session was played...didn&#39;t have to do\n&gt; &gt; anything else until I wanted to replay. I still like it. Still\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t get into Ann&#39;s files...nothing personal.

All of your files are listed with an icon that looks like\n&gt; &gt; a square with a microphone and a CD. It is the only clickable\n&gt; &gt; thing--I can&#39;t click the title of the clip, for example. When I\n&gt; &gt; click it, nothing ever happens. I looks like it is loading but\n&gt; &gt; nothing comes of it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve had this problem with esnips since it first started up.
