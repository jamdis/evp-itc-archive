Depending on the year it happened, old newspapers, obituaries, or books can usually hold info like that and if its something curious they may already have a folder of info if it pertains to local history on the hotel. A simple phone call to the libraries in the vicinity should give you an idea if they have any mircrofiche or digitally saved info from that era.\n\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- On Thu, 8/14/08, Pridegrl Neverumind &lt;charmedbyu20032003@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: Pridegrl Neverumind &lt;charmedbyu20032003@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] A quesion about research and investigations\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, August 14, 2008, 2:50 PM\n&gt; Chad\n&gt; Â \n&gt; you could look on the website for the city of Gatlinburg,\n&gt; and check to see if they have a historical society there. (\n&gt; we have one here) if so, they are usually a fountain of\n&gt; historical information ( with the added bonus that they have\n&gt; already done all the research and verifications, saving you\n&gt; countless hours of doing it yourself)\n&gt; If people ask why you want to know this stuff ( I have\n&gt; never had a history buff ask me why I wanted to know about\n&gt; history) but if they asked, I would say something along the\n&gt; lines of-&#39; im interested in the history of this\n&gt; place&#39;.. after all, historical stuff, legends and\n&gt; stories real or imagined can be fascinating.\n&gt; hope that helps and good luck\n&gt; Charm\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 8/14/08, Chad &lt;cawiggins78@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Chad &lt;cawiggins78@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] A quesion about research and\n&gt; investigations\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Received: Thursday, August 14, 2008, 12:18 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am going to Gatlinburg, TN. While there I will be doing\n&gt; an\n&gt; investigation at a hotel. I was wondering where would be\n&gt; the best\n&gt; place to research two murders that occurred at the hotle.\n&gt; Should I\n&gt; start at the police department? I have searched the\n&gt; internet, but\n&gt; found no details.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;      \n&gt; __________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get a sneak peak at messages with a handy reading pane with\n&gt; All new Yahoo!
