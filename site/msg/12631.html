<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yep Allen is correct, thats the fix. Some posts are made via email with attchments and the only way to recieve files that are attached to posts is to put your settings on individual email.

&gt; I had the same problem.  I broke down and changed my setting
&gt; so now I
&gt;  get individual emails from the group.  That solved the
&gt; problem for me.

&gt; &gt; Ok, when someone posts a non-stored embedded soundclip
&gt; or video, I
&gt; &gt; find it to be non-clickable. I am forced to run latest
&gt; version of
&gt; &gt; firefox, but at work with ie6 I have the same issue.
&gt; How do I open
&gt; &gt; these post attachments? I am sure the answer is
&gt; painfully obvious, so
&gt; &gt; here is a preemptive &quot;d&#x27;oh!&quot;
&gt; &gt;
