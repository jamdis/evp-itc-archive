I find some like certain methods better to make thier voice. And often they will state thier approval or disapproval for the method I am experimenting with. A few do not like music method they say its too much noise they cant get a word in edgewise, yet others enjoy it and make use of it with ease speaking very loud over the music notes. For water method nobody complains (i dont know why) and for sweep methods, only a few seem to have trouble using it to form thier words.
   
  Perhaps it has to do with vibrational frequencies I dont know. Once the lines are open and communication is flowing it gets interesting to say the least =)
   
  Just experiment and find whats working best for you personally.

is why I could never get evps from him after a year of trying, but he
has taken to communicating through the box like a fish to water.
