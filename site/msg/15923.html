LOL Frank yeah you have alot of stuff there and besides most of your files =
here=A0are just attachments now anyway. That filespace is much larger for g=
roup. Like 1 gig for attachments. I dont know why yahoo doesnt just give us=
 more space for group but they said its in the plans down the road. Just=A0=
notifying the newbies before they waste time uploading a ton of wav files t=
o group space. Save them the hassle of reuploading later =3D)
