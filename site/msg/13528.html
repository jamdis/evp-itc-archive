I heard on darkness radio in an interview that Dave had with Bill that
the =
ovilus will only
be available until the end of the year. BIll wants to get =
back into
investigating and research
for awhile. Making the ovilus and the =
other equipment he sells has kept
him really busy.

I personally =

investigator just =
purchased one. She has used it only a few times but
the results were encour=
ageing. On her first recorded session, when
asking "why are you here", the =
reply that she recieved certainly seemed
relevant. The Ovilus stated " fell=
 running down stairs, broken neck".
Another interesting response from the r=
ecording was in reply to the
question "who are you?" The response from the =
Ovilus was "ghost".
However, she also recieved responses that did not seem =
relevant to the
questions she was asking at the time. She sends me all of h=
er recordings
for review so I will keep you posted on the results. Personal=
ly, I can't
wait to get my hands on one to try it out for myself.
