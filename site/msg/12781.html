This conversation has gone in a wild direction. It would be impossible to p=
rove that a ghost can fit into a microwave, just as it would be impossible =
to prove that the ghost could even get into the room that housed the microw=
ave. The likely fact is that whatever the ghosts are, they are not really c=
oming here into our 3d world at all when they put their voices on, or influ=
ence our recordings, this is obviously all done extra-dimensionally. Certai=
nly we can know for sure that ghosts do not have 3 dimensional bodies, and =
so do not exist in 3 dimensional space (where our rooms and microwaves exis=
t). Obviously they exist only in higher dimensions, maybe even outside of 1=
1 dimensional space altogether. Who knows?

  No. I'm only saying that claiming that any or all Spirits can fit =
in a Microwave Box is not necessarily so.

  You have an assumption. Where =
is the reasoning behind it?
