<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all,

 Just wanted to say I got up today and just turned on the RS 20-125 
and heard some of them saying &quot; Happy Birthday &quot; to me and it is my 
birthday I was shocked to hear that LOL. I also heard someone in the 
background singing &quot; Happy Birthday &quot; too. How cool is that, no 
coincidence seems like to me. Here is another story I was watching TV 
the Grammy Awards and when Little Richard and Jerry lee Lewis was on 
there was another singer with them from Credence Clearwater Revival I 
couldn&#x27;t remember his name. So as I was listening to the spirits I 
heard a voice today say &quot; John Fogerty &quot; is that his name I think it 
is? How cool was that ? Oh well just some stuff to ponder on. You all 
have a great evening.

Regards,

Ralph the Ghost Hunter</pre>
