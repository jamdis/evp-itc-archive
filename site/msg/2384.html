Hi all;  Well it happened again--first #24 would not work wiht when we wer=
e trying to get a K2 meter response the weekend before last. then Monday ni=
ght the same thing happened wiht someone else. I took the box back to the w=
ork bench, and it works fine!  Our dingbat daughter in-law gave us a 'rescu=
e' poodle a couple weeks ago, which was fine, and a cute little dog. Last n=
gith she fell off the bed and broke leg! The segment talks about that, from=
 #24. I left it long cuz there's some other voices in it, like Bob Houston,=
 a guide I think as he frequently comes through. It's interesting to doa go=
ogle on 'Bob Houston'.     Frank
