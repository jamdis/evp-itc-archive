It seems to be a bit better than the amplified lapel \nmic I am using inside my echo chamber.  I am experimenting with two \nmics, as when I added the splitter I couldn&#39;t get any audio out of it \nlike you do.  It must either be the mic you are using is better, or \nthe headphones/earbuds you use are amplified (??).\n\nThanks,\n\nLC\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have produced another video, this one of my completed portable \nGhost \n&gt; Box System (Mike&#39;s Box 12.470)\n&gt; This video, in three parts on YouTube walks you through how the \nchamber \n&gt; system works, while describing the components and going through the \n&gt; description of how to control the devices with the chamber closed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Video - Portable Ghost Box System Part 1 of 3\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUOkWGrz94s\n&gt; \n&gt; Video - Portable Ghost Box System Part 2 of 3\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirOLjEf1bQ\n&gt; \n&gt; Video - Portable Ghost Box System Part 3 of 3\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs7ep7-G7Aw\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt;"}
