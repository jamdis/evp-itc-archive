I don&#39;t see that you can even download the \naudio to your computer.\n\nI paid about $60 for a brand-new Olympus VN-960PC.  It records 6 hours in \nhi-quality mode and comes with USB connector cable and software to copy \nyour files to your computer.\n\nI&#39;ve also used it to record ham radio conversations, Morse code and bird \ncalls and it does an excellent job for all of those. Radio Shack carries \nsimilar models made by Olympus now.\n\nZack\n\nOn Wed, 28 Nov 2007, judy_in_hollywood wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi All, For those who have money to get it . . . . this is on Ebay = to \n&gt; get EVP&#39;s . . . . only bad part is it&#39;s $575. + S/H!  =Judy=\n&gt;"}
