I have a friend who \n&gt; is Christian and she says that it feels like  we&#39;re living in the last days \n&gt; of Rome... sadly, by what I see around me, I  really have nothing with which \n&gt; I can disagree... we can only wait and  see....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) ,  \n&gt; SnowfireL@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; __http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3pDxJNEIBQ&feature=feedu__ \n&gt; (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3pDxJNEIBQ&feature=feedu_)   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (_http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3pDxJNEIBQ&feature=feedu_ \n&gt; (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3pDxJNEIBQ&feature=feedu) )  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; __http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plrf5PVyoQ4&feature=related__ \n&gt; (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plrf5PVyoQ4&feature=related_)   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (_http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plrf5PVyoQ4&feature=related_ \n&gt; (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plrf5PVyoQ4&feature=related) )  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; __http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNNMwpDt5R8&feature=feedu__ \n&gt; (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNNMwpDt5R8&feature=feedu_)   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (_http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNNMwpDt5R8&feature=feedu_ \n&gt; (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNNMwpDt5R8&feature=feedu) )  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This stuff is so weird, wonder what is happening,  an Egyptian friend \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mine the only Christian Coptic Church was  destroyed by Muslims. sf\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
