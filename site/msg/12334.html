<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hope not to stray too far off topic, but I was listening to an older 
interview with Jeff Belanger and the host, Dave Schrader said that 
while on a ghost hunt (I don&#x27;t remember where, Rolling Hills perhaps) 
many members present were getting the name &quot;Seth&quot; across multiple 
shack hack boxes. After hearing that, I remembered this thread and 
the references to Seth. It is amazing how these entities use 
recurring names for many different researchers using many different 
methods. Anways, sorry for the OT.

Thanks
Andy

&gt; I considered doing that but its a very long list and I don&#x27;t know if
&gt; the guy that built the Ovilus would approve of the list being posted
&gt; without permission.

&gt; &gt; Why don&#x27;t you just post the list for the whole group?

&gt; &gt; The software that came with my ovilus has a list on it. I can 
email
&gt; &gt; you the list if you&#x27;d like to have it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How much have you used your Ovilus? Have you used it enough to get
&gt; &gt; anywhere near hearing all of the supposed 512 words?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t get the name Seth from my Ovilis. Where did
&gt; &gt; &gt; You get a list of words the Ovilus use?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new here, but have been into paranormal research for 6 
years
&gt; now.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am the type of person that never gets EVP voices with a
&gt; recorder so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I thought I would experiment with things like the Frank&#x27;s box 
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ovilus. I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a 
cemetery and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field where a church burned down many years ago. I can not 
get too
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific without having people thinking I am making stuff up 
but it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of 
the time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of 
random
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved 
over
&gt; to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active 
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started saying relevant words like cross and priest. The 
Ovilus was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MUCH more active when being used by our female member. Towards
&gt; the end
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me 
told Seth
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that she did not want to talk to you I&#x27;ve heard bad things 
about
&gt; you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she
&gt; started
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head.
&gt; Needless
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to say we ended the session and got out of there.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the course of our investigation we found that the Ovilus 
was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so 
yesterday I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did some test recordings to see what words would come up and 
one of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the first things that came up was: seth blamed rest I am not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gare demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am
&gt; not even
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the 
ovilus
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying this.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying
&gt; aren&#x27;t on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the 
list, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Barry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words 
he is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; getting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger 
list than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My most important question is is anyone else getting the name
&gt; Seth out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
