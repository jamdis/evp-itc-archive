It&#39;s one thing to be skeptical, it&#39;s another to ignore and deny all evidence. &quot;\n\nBut, have you considered that the problem you are seeing may not be because of skeptics, but because of the evidence being presented, and that ANY discussion that it might not really be evidence of anything significant is attacked with comments like &#39;Bite Me&quot;?  \n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  It&#39;s done! I think this group has been over run by debunker/skeptics and any discussion has become impossible. They will tell everyone it&#39;s just imagination, except in rare ocassions so they can maintain some credibilty. I don&#39;t know where everyone else has gone, but they never comment. Guess the rest just want only ghost hunter related stuff, and igore all else.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  f-S\n&gt;"}
