  Well as a great lover of Radio Shack's various projects (150 in=
 1 was my fave), I'm pretty sure you will not be able to build a sweeping A=
M radio from that.  Sorry.  But they are great to learn basic principles fr=
om.

  Also while the jury is still out on whether or not free energy machi=
nes exist, it is definitely not going to be able to be built using a radio =
shack learning lab.  Otherwise everyone would have one by now and we would =
not need the power companies.

  I am too intrested in makin=
g my own box. I recieved my Radio Shack Electronics Learning Lab just a las=
t week from EBay http://cgi.ebay. com/BRAND- NEW-ELECTRONICS- LEARNING- LAB=
-RADIO- SHACK-28- 280_W0QQitemZ150 404642293QQcmdZV iewItemQQptZLH_ Default=
Domain_ 0?hash=3Ditem2304d 0b5f5#shId.
  I believe I can learn electronics =
using this kit and YouTube videos.
  I am following a video lesson course o=
n how to use the Electronics leaning Lab on YouTube Here's the Link: http:/=
/www.youtube. com/watch? v=3DxGHjd88ASNM&feature=3Dfvw
  I hope using this =
electronics kit I can learn to make a box out of it so anyone who knows ele=
ctronics or this kit will believe and can make something like a ghost radio=
 box. I also believe I can try to make a few different boxs out of this kit=
. But does anyone have the diagrames? or the chips/parts? Videos on how too=
 are good also.

  I also would like to try to make my Eletronics learning =
Lab into a free energy device. Does any one have any plans on that?
  Here'=
s a YouTube video on that: http://www.youtube. com/watch? v=3DEe9uYqFb- OI

  Thanks.
