No,=
 I don't think I am being too critical, but I may have expectations that ar=
e a little too high. =C2=A0I want to take my time with this. =C2=A0For my o=
wn understanding, I need to have a large sample size so I know not only wha=
t to expect to see, but what to look for. =C2=A0I have seen ITC snapshots f=
rom programs like this that offer full faces. =C2=A0I would be more incline=
d to believe in such an image as opposed to, lets say. two dark lines that =
may or may not be eyebrows.


Even in your example of the towel, you get ha=
lf a face. =C2=A0If you have half a face (on the vertical plane, not the ho=
rizontal) you can extrapolate out what the entire face would look like. =C2=
=A0This is something I would like to get myself and I would consider that e=
vidence if it showed up in one of these programs. =C2=A0But, if you have so=
mething that looks like a forehead and that is all there is, then it could =
also look like a rock or some other such object.


I am certainly hoping fo=
r results worked into box sessions. =C2=A0Directing a session with intent, =
like saying "I am going to examine the sound waves of this communication in=
 hopes of seeing your face. =C2=A0Is it possible you can show your face to =
me now through sound? " is what I am after. =C2=A0If a positive hit like th=
is happens, then I will be jumping for joy. =C2=A0Another good example woul=
d be a name, lets say Tom, that occurs. =C2=A0If you get a positive affirma=
tion that the name you heard is present, then you try the same technique on=
ly you address Tom by name and get a face, that would be even better.


But=
, as it stands now, the faces as they appear are random at best. =C2=A0I wo=
uld be more inclined to believe that when these faces do occur , they are g=
oing to occur with a lesser frequency than multiple images in a few seconds=
 of audio like Ursula's example. =C2=A0If this where the case, there would =
be dozens, and possibly hundreds, of faces during a ten minute session and =
I just don't think that is possible. =C2=A0This is why I need to look at se=
veral samples to find out if this is the case or not. =C2=A0If these partia=
lized faces occur in multiples all the time, I would be more apt to discoun=
t it. =C2=A0But, if they are a rarity affixed to only a few clips out of do=
zens, I would be more inclined to believe in them. =C2=A0Sample size is eve=
rything. =C2=A0It is like listening to GBC. =C2=A0If you have never done a =
session before, you would be inclined to believe every stray radio signal i=
s a communication. =C2=A0Only by continued practice (expanding your sample =
size) can you start to
 rule out stray radio with any degree of accuracy. =
=C2=A0


On the other hand, I am very new to this and I could certainly be =
wrong. =C2=A0I will continue to plug sound into the programs and hope for t=
he best. =C2=A0


I really want this to work. =C2=A0As you have probably ex=
perienced, when they want you to hear something or know something, they mak=
e it very obvious while communicating. =C2=A0I am hoping they apply this sa=
me rigor to this new format to show us that they are there. =C2=A0If they c=
an, then the world of video and audio ITC will merge in one source and then=
 the skeptics be damned!
