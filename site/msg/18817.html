<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks. Mostly what I want to know is if I&#x27;m just hearing broadcast frags,
or if anyone hears something similar to what I get. Kinda like additional
testing.

&gt;    Less than a minute of FM, you can hear more feedback in this--feedback
&gt; is from being in echo chamber mode. At 3 seconds &quot;box---big box&#x27;,
&gt; 15--seconds &quot;Hultay gets---something&quot;, at about 23 seconds a weird one &quot;the
&gt; end comes in hours--you leave the planet&quot;, like I haven&#x27;t heard that about a
&gt; thousand times.
&gt;
&gt;  I found if I lift the top panel up I kills the feedback, so I drilled some
&gt; 3/8 vent holes in the sides that helped quite a bit.
&gt;
&gt;  These aren&#x27;t Jack approved EVPs, so probably not real, since they are not
&gt; in digital format--except conversion to mp3 for e-mailing. This recording
&gt; started out braodcast out of the radio station analog, traveled to the radio
&gt; in analog RF, was down converted in the radio chip in analog circuits, and
&gt; the audio was recorded on magnetic tape. The EVPs are clearer from tape,
&gt; that&#x27;s why I use it, cuz digital sucks! I&#x27;d use tubes if it wasn&#x27;t for the
&gt; high voltage power supplies and larger transformers. Some worship this high
&gt; tech crap, which is killing the planet. They over estimate it&#x27;s true value.
