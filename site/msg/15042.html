                  A mistake that a lot of people make is thinking that ther=
e are two different types of energy at work when it comes to sound waves an=
d electromagnetic waves. The only thing that seperates them is frequency an=
d power. Radio waves are radio waves because they occupy a certain block of=
 the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same spectrum jus=
t farther down with much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can pe=
netrate almost anything because of their wavelengths. The shorter the wavel=
ength the more ways we can shield against them.

                          =
Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and telemetry transmitt=
ing wave but the waves also have a physical effect on our environment by ca=
using molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A little lower than this i=
s IR or infrared it too can cause physical objects to heat up but usually i=
t just causes molecules to rotate in place. All physical things give off IR=
 light. Its a way the total system conserves energy by spontaneously emitti=
ng IR radiation.

                            Here is some food for thought. I am curr=
ently reviewing my audio from our May 30th investigation.

                =
            It was me and another girl teammate present in the room. I pick=
ed up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry with me.=
 We were standing right next to another digital video recorder that I leave=
 beside my night vision camera. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd voic=
e. I have asked the girl that was with me to check her recording to see if =
she picked it up.

                            I have long felt the true EV=
P does not come from sound waves in the environment, or then it wouldn't be=
 EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are appearing directly on the =
recordings.

                            This instance with the recorders m=
ay back that theory up. That other recorder should have picked that voice u=
p if it were sound waves in the environment.

                            I=
 am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The file that is named "01-02-17 =
Clip" is the full clip. You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", and then an=
other comes in right after that. I think I know what it says.

            =
                Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not he=
ar this until playback. It isn't clear, so I am not as excited about it as =
my one's from the last investigation.

                                I h=
ave a running theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodula=
ted exactly where they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne pri=
nciple. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequenc=
y then if you add or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or alt=
ernate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and =
you have an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KH=
z then you will have a intermediate difference frequency at 9KHz, well with=
in human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all e=
lectronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. F=
rom this theory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few inches o=
f the recorder.

                                We are able to reproduce t=
his affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with aco=
ustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce called =
the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
