I actually tested it on a crime case.\n\nI think I am going to really like this radio, but still have much more testing to do before I start using it with my clients.\n\nI sent Chris a note as I am still trying to figure out what the toggle switch on top is for.\n\nChris if you see this note, please tell me what that toggle switch is, and I have a suggestion for your next radio.\n\nSteve Hultay you may need what I suggest too.\n\nThe silver dial that controls the speed of the scan, if you can add a circle label underneath that displays 1/8 line increments in a circular pattern, so we can turn the dial to each increment. What this will allow the user to do is mark the line increment that works best for recording.\n\nFor me I need to be able to turn the device on and record for a client, and it will be hard for me to try and find that sweet spot every time I record.\n\nI am going to see if I can find or make a sticker to place under the dial.\n\nAgain, so far I love it! Especially knowing I will likely not need to use Clear Voice or any other software to bring clarity.\n\nI will keep you informed.\n\nMichael Edwards  http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/SDWR-SpeakingToTheDeadWithRadios-/"}
