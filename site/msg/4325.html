<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Leslie,

To get you started...

Mini Box - (about $400 - $500)
http://www.paranormalsystems.com/The_MiniBox.html

Frank&#x27;s Box - (Not for sale, he offers them to people every once-in-
awhile)
http://www.franks-boxes.com

There are many other websites that offer information on Franks Box, 
too.

Joe&#x27;s Box - (Price ???)
http://www.keyportparanormal.com

Radio Shack Hack - ($25 - $100) I&#x27;ve put together a number of 
configurations using the Radio Shack Hack 12-469 &amp; 12-470.  You can 
see the detailed videos here: http://www.youtube.com/ufogeek
You can also see some of my Radio Shack Hack photos here:  
http://www.ufogeek.com

Many other people are putting together different configurations of 
the Radio Shack Hack, and they share their findings on this forum.

Digital Dowsing - (Price ???)
http://www.digitaldowsing.com

Welcome... I&#x27;m sure others will provide additional information, as 
many of the researchers here have their own websites. This is a very 
friendly place!

&gt; Hi, all! 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m a newbie to this list, and very excited about what I&#x27;ve been 
reading the
&gt; last week or so.
&gt; 
&gt; Briefly, though I am a corporate consultant and exective coach by
&gt; profession, I&#x27;ve been a channel since 1971, working with one 
(wonderful)
&gt; guide. I&#x27;ve also done lots of psychic work over the years, had lots 
of
&gt; experiences, and consider the unseen world as &quot;normal&quot; and real as 
our
&gt; so-called ordinary world.
&gt; 
&gt; I have wanted for years to try recording voices of my unseen 
associates, and
&gt; am SO excited to begin to experiment, so I thank you all for the 
invaluable
&gt; information I&#x27;m reading on this list so far!
&gt; 
&gt; I have some very basic questions, and apologize if they are too 
simple or
&gt; repetitious for the more experienced and regular members of this 
list.
&gt; 
&gt; When some of you are mentioning that your mini-box is on the way, 
from where
&gt; are you buying it? What other systems are available, other than 
making one
&gt; with the Radio Shack radios (which I will experiment with for 
sure!).
&gt; 
&gt; Would it be possible to list the possible other equipment that one 
might
&gt; buy, and the sources? Or is this already available somewhere on the
&gt; yahoogroups website for this group?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance to one and all for any help you can give me with 
this...
&gt; there&#x27;s SO much great info here it&#x27;s a bit hard to sort out as a 
newbie on
&gt; the list who just dove in recently!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Leslie (in NYC)
