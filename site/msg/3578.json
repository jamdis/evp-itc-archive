I gave a quick breakdown for a few of them I&#39;ve used on my page (which still needs updating LOL) and many others have websites built around the subject. I havent had alot of time to spend on it but when I do the results are sometimes worth the wait. I wish I had all day to spend on research when I want to. I&#39;d try alot more things just out of curiousity sake alone along with things they mention.\n   \n  I dont think I posted any of my pics in the file area, I made the gallery instead. You can view it if you find any of the methods interest you and want to see examples. Ive posted a few hundred there so far. the good, the bad, the &quot;what the heck is that&quot; and the stereogram type. \n   \n  Some are whole faces of someone I knew, as for the rest your on your own as to who/what you may or may not see. I need to update that again too and add new stuff LOL\n   \n  Anyway you can try a few methods and see whats working well for you.\n  http://misty.xm.com/tech.html\n  http://webcamitc.myphotoalbum.com/\n   \n  Keith also has some great itc images using different methods\n  http://www.itcbridge.com\n   \n  Lauras been experimenting in a few new ways\n  http://www.esnips.com/user/ITCExperimenter\n   \n  Lance has been experimenting alot lately\n  http://www.ukevpresearch.com/index.htm\n   \n  yeah yeah I know I left some of you out but you can post your own dang links to your sites\n   \n  \n   \n  Misty\n   \n   \n   \n   \n  Rita &lt;nvrenuf1031@...&gt; wrote:\n          How do you do it is the question, I quess?
