I&#39;ve read a number of examples but your posted article is one \nof the better ones. It seems to me that the linear path of time makes \nsense for the physical world, truth and using intuition to find it are \neternal. Intuition is the key, but most people are caught up with the \nneed to verify everthing and miss the opportunity to use their own \nfeelings to guide decisions. \n\nScrying is an easy way bypass the logicical brain processes and tap \ninto the vast truth that is not affected by people talking themselves \nout of following their own instincts. Sometimes I approach a Frank&#39;s \nBox (FB) session with this mindset, sort of like electronic scrying. I \nwill hear answers that may be constructed through my own mind power \nmatrixing the raw audio. Humans are indeed capable of altering the \nphysical world with thought energy (see the EGG project link: \nhttp://noosphere.princeton.edu/ ) and in the case of a FB session it \ncould be this ability that allows a FB to tap into the ether where \nintuition lies and find the truth. The ether contains all the thought \nenergy from all time past and present. \n\n-Bill Murphy\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ken Thomas &lt;kennnthomas2000@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1828856/posts\n&gt;"}
