&gt; No one needs to spy to get the information here. This group shares
&gt; information freely with the world. As for Karen she made a little appearance
&gt; on a show on PTN yesterday and when I realized who their guest was I
&gt; referenced my previous note to her about her research tactics or lack
&gt; thereof. Someone else (her boyfriend) asked her if she is such a good
&gt; researcher why couldnt she find waverly and she said &quot;is that question from
&gt; some bitch named Misty&quot;. LOL no it wasn&#x27;t Karen actually you have your
&gt; boyfriend to thank for that one because he is the one who outed you and
&gt; trashed you on air for all to see and hear, not me.
&gt;
&gt; As I said a dumb bitch no...bitch maybe...depends on what kind of bull you
&gt; are trying to pass off as documented research. So here Karen Stollznow this
&gt; is for you just because I know you liked my previous post to you enough that
&gt; your felt it resorted to name calling. Which shows me exactly what kind of
&gt; person you are and what state of mind you are in.
&gt;
&gt; POSTED FROM MY PREVIOUS MESSAGE TO THIS GROUP WHICH INSPIRED HER TO CALL ME
&gt; A NAME. WOW I WAS ACTUALLY BEING PRETTY NICE WHEN I POSTED IT.

&gt; Karen obviously does not research before she writes her articles.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;However, the precise location of the Sanatorium is a closely guarded
&gt; secret.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Ummm Karen needs to learn to use Google as well. If she had she would have
&gt; been able to print out a map to Waverly which includes information such as
&gt; tracks, businesses, adresses AND golf courses at the corner. It even shows
&gt; you an overhead view of each building you pass along the way on each street.
&gt; Hint to Karen click sattelite view after you explore closeups of map view.
&gt;
&gt; Im sorry but if you are going to write a well informed article the first
&gt; step is become well informed. I wont bother reading the rest of her articles
&gt; because I wont waste my time looking at research from someone who cant
&gt; bother to cover the basics like look at a map before you drive out to
&gt; someplace you&#x27;ve never been before and then misinform people that it is in a
&gt; secret location. Nor do I see walking on a tour as as actual &quot;investigation&quot;
&gt; .
&gt;
&gt; Alot of the people once believed the earth was flat, unfortunately they
&gt; were not &quot;well informed&quot; and they too were victims of shoddy research.
&gt; Luckily there are those who do look beyond the horizon and open their minds
&gt; to the possibility that there is more out there.
&gt; _____END QUOTE______
&gt;
&gt; You also may want to check the website of the place before you visit, as
&gt; you will see they also give directions to their establishment on there. I am
&gt; sorry I wont waste my time reading any more of this wannabe &quot;researcher&quot;
&gt; articles. I would rather spend my time actually learning something.
&gt;
&gt; Have a great day Karen and just remember if you are going to open your
&gt; mouth and insert foot, it&#x27;s always a good idea to scrape the crap off it
&gt; first!
&gt;
&gt; Love and Light
&gt; Misty
