Two things appear\nt=\r\no be going on though. \n\nFirst there is an actual voice modulated signal. Di=\r\nfferent people who\nlisten to it often hear the same thing. The sound is not=\r\n perfect and is\nvery noisy, so that would explain others who cannot hear th=\r\ne message.\n\nThe second thing is that some people can listen to the noise as=\r\n a\n&quot;random field&quot;, and with a slightly altered state of mind, this field\nwi=\r\nll induce latent &quot;mediumship&quot; ability in the operator and he or she\nwill ge=\r\nt a lot more information and voice material than another\nlistener.\n\n       =\r\n               \n\nNote that the content random fields have little or nothing=\r\n in common\nwith whatever imagery or sounds may be percieved from them. They=\r\n simply\nenhance the user to access psychic information that, while even not=\r\n\nbeing a &quot;psychic&quot; allows him to get info normally innaccessable to\nhim/her=\r\n.\n\nIf there is any objective percieved sound similar to what is heard by\not=\r\nhers impressed upon the background noise, it might be due to the\nspirit who=\r\n is speaking being PRESENT. That entity would then be able to\nget the messa=\r\nge through to the operator Psychicly on another level.\nthat the words are a=\r\nlso in the noise would be a co-incidence.\n\n                      \n\nI work w=\r\nith VISUAL random fields---The imagery, while clear, is formed\nin my mind/e=\r\nye system , so I cannot photograph it. Some of this EVP\nbackground noise ma=\r\ny be working the same way too---formed in the\nMind/EAR system. This is only=\r\n heard by the primary operator and likely\ncannot be recorded to a file. \n\nB=\r\nut some random field stuff IS objective--for example, using a random\nbackdr=\r\nop for ghost photos makes the ghosts easier to, and more often\nappear in a =\r\nphoto. This is equavalent to the EVP that people can hear\non the recorded f=\r\nile.\n\n                      \n\nI will discuss and explain random field theor=\r\ny itself, later, in its\nown posting. \n\n                      \n\n--- In EVP-I=\r\nTC@yahoogroups\n.com, Zack Widup\n                      &lt;w9sz.zack@.\n..&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Just a guess, since I don&#39;t have a lot of experience with this -\np=\r\nrobably\n\n&gt; the mesages are meant for one user and it&#39;s best if one user\nlis=\r\ntens at a\n\n&gt; time.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; It could be that some messages come through that =\r\nare meant for\nmultiple\n\n&gt; users at once.

Two th=\r\nings appear\nto be going on though. &lt;br&gt;\nFirst there is an actual voice modu=\r\nlated signal. Different people who\nlisten to it often hear the same thing. =\r\nThe sound is not perfect and is\nvery noisy, so that would explain others wh=\r\no cannot hear the message.&lt;br&gt;\nThe second thing is that some people can lis=\r\nten to the noise as a\n&quot;random field&quot;, and with a slightly altered state of =\r\nmind, this field\nwill induce latent &quot;mediumship&quot; ability in the operator an=\r\nd he or she\nwill get a lot more information and voice material than another=\r\n\nlistener.&lt;br&gt;\n                      &lt;br&gt;\nNote that the content random fiel=\r\nds have little or nothing in common\nwith whatever imagery or sounds may be =\r\npercieved from them. They simply\nenhance the user to access psychic informa=\r\ntion that, while even not\nbeing a &quot;psychic&quot; allows him to get info normally=\r\n innaccessable to\nhim/her.&lt;br&gt;\nIf there is any objective percieved sound si=\r\nmilar to what is heard by\nothers impressed upon the background noise, it mi=\r\nght be due to the\nspirit who is speaking being PRESENT. That entity would t=\r\nhen be able to\nget the message through to the operator Psychicly on another=\r\n level.\nthat the words are also in the noise would be a co-incidence.&lt;br&gt;\n =\r\n                     &lt;br&gt;\nI work with VISUAL random fields---The imagery, w=\r\nhile clear, is formed\nin my mind/eye system , so I cannot photograph it. So=\r\nme of this EVP\nbackground noise may be working the same way too---formed in=\r\n the\nMind/EAR system. This is only heard by the primary operator and likely=\r\n\ncannot be recorded to a file. &lt;br&gt;\nBut some random field stuff IS objectiv=\r\ne--for example, using a random\nbackdrop for ghost photos makes the ghosts e=\r\nasier to, and more often\nappear in a photo. This is equavalent to the EVP t=\r\nhat people can hear\non the recorded file.&lt;br&gt;\n                      &lt;br&gt;\nI =\r\nwill discuss and explain random field theory itself, later, in its\nown post=\r\ning. &lt;br&gt;\n                      &lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_=\r\nblank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://mc/compose?to=3DEVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@ya=\r\nhoogroups\n.com&lt;/a&gt;, Zack Widup\n                      &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;moz-txt-link-rfc2396E&quot;&gt;&lt;w9sz.zack@.\n..&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Just a guess, since I don&#39;t have a lot of experience with this -\npro=\r\nbably&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the mesages are meant for one user and it&#39;s best if one user=\r\n\nlistens at a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; time.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It could be that some messa=\r\nges come through that are meant for\nmultiple&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; users at once.
