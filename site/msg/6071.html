             Many of us have "Skype.com" so we do on occasion sessions across the states.  If you want to download it (its free) maybe some of us would be able to have you join us for a session or too to see how we interact with the box and just how we start and end our sessions.  
   
              There are many reseachers here (whether they are in it for personal reasons or curiousity sake) and we all do our sessions differently (which is no right or wrong way).  Its all in what you feel comfortable with.  
   
               Feel free to email myself or some of the others (under separate cover) and we will get you up and running!
   
               Looking forward to hearing your clips!

          Hi all,

I've been reading all the posts for the last couple days....I'm a little
afraid to ask but here goes....I'm experienced with evp...but know nothing
about the radio shack hack....could someone tell me step by step how to
have a session? I'm intrigued and really want to start delving into all
of this.

Thank you
Carol B.
