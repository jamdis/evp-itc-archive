<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well Id first wish to introduce myself. My name is Matt Dowdell and im from a small group of people who have been doing paranormal research/investigation in the CT area. This is my first post, but i have been lurking threw these forums for some time.

One thing i would like everyone who reads this realize is that paranormal research/investigating, like any new science, nothing can be written in stone.

Now i do want to say that the research into the boxes and other devices by Frank and others can not go unnoticed, but there is still one or two flaws in them.

I mean, with the short bit i listened to, i dont feel as if they are bashing you or frank personally but the idea behind the boxes, but without a doubt in a ignorant fashion.

Regardless, i personally try to stay away from the boxes, but i join this site inorder to learn more about them and how they work. To me the boxes have to much &quot;chance&quot; to may be or may not be something. I have used one in the past and had an interesting result, but for all i know, it could have been a rogue radio wave from a station in the area. Im just hoping to give you an idea of this thinking is VS bashing your ideas and work, which im simpley not. Science is about proving something from every angle and being without a doubt its correct without anyone able to say its something else.

Unfortunetly, with the boxes, there is alot of noise and when matrixing comes into mind, you create a situation where something is absolutly nothing, seems to be otherwise. Im not saying they dont work, from it, again im saying it could be a &quot;chance&quot;.

Video, pictures are fool proof, audio really isnt, and honestly, when my team picks up EVPs we go into them with a doubtful mind and dont depend on them to be our evidence.</pre>
