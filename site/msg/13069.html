&gt; I love this forum and do not like to get involved in the online 
mish mash . . . I have to say, though . . . Rick . . . are you new to 
this forum? Mike is respected in this field and though I cannot 
speak for him I am 100 % certain that he knows what he is getting 
into . . . I, as well as several members of my team follow and 
respect his work and his ideals. 
&gt; 
&gt; I thought this was suppose to be a forum that shared ideas and 
knowledge with regard to EVP/ITC rather than what I see happening 
here on a daily basis.
&gt; 
&gt; Rock on Mike!!
