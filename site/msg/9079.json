I think being a physical part of the process is what draws me to manual radio \nsweep, and what made me try SS2 with the allophones.  I think our unconscious decisions \nabout how fast or slow to move the dial/slider, and when to change directions, can help \nimprove communication.  But that&#39;s just been my experience.  I know some others do not \nfeel the same.  \n\nI will say I find it&#39;s a little easier to listen realtime to the responses when I&#39;m not manually \nsweeping, as that can be a bit like jumping up and down on one foot while patting my \nhead with one hand and rubbing my tummy with the other!  LOL.  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s fascinating to me.  I was just sweeping randomly by feel, \n&gt; maybe the user has to be a part of the evp experience. \n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Steve,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How where you manipulating the slide bar in sound soap?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Was it progressive fom on end to the other, Was it jumping around \n&gt; &gt; randomly?\n&gt; &gt; Please explain, I want to test it out tomorrow.
