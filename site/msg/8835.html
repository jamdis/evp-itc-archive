<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I like AM on other radios, but on the 12-820 the FM works the best.  
I really get some good answers from it, the sweep rate is a little 
quick but they can work it nicely.  So, i would suggest using the FM 
on that one, but that&#x27;s just my preference.  Anyway, i appreciate 
your dedication to this research and everyday i feel i have to play 
catch up with the awesome communication you get.  Nah, just kidding.  
We all work together like family, aint that right sis?

Always a great job K,
-Steve H. (A Fan)

&gt; Thanks for your input Steve! It&#x27;s hard to get an ear for the 
allophones
&gt; because I am so used to zoning in that it now goes against my grain 
to zone
&gt; out.  But practice makes better!
&gt; 
&gt; And yes it beats the falling out.. I mean hanging out my window any 
day!  I
&gt; returned the badly hacked Hultay Hack and went directly to another 
RS and
&gt; bought one (don&#x27;t tell anyone).  This time I hacked correctly - But 
I swear
&gt; I almost screwed it up again..  Those dang wires..
&gt; 
&gt; But it works and I taped a session and a I&#x27;m going over it now.  
Reception
&gt; is much better on this but I find the Am sweeps much slower than 
the 470 or
&gt; 469.  Therefore I am hearing stations far longer than I want to.

&gt; The first one i hear &quot;Arthur---employee airhole&quot;. Maybe they are 
&gt; describing a situation while alive and we just aren&#x27;t understanding 
&gt; correctly. The second i hear &quot;You forget the evil eye&quot;. The last 
one 
&gt; i hear as you do. Hey, this format beats hanging out the window to 
get 
&gt; a signal from the shack hack and it&#x27;s clearer too. I think when we 
get 
&gt; familiar with the speech from this, it&#x27;s going to be fantastic. 
Others 
&gt; should try this method as well, who live in a bad radio signal 
location.

&gt; &gt; I just posted three MP3 files in my folder (Kristin&#x27;s Folder)from 
a
&gt; &gt; session I did today using EVP Maker and the Allophones. Please 
listen
&gt; &gt; to see if you hear as I do. I find this way much tougher to hear
&gt; &gt; live... so I hope I am doign better! Please let me know. THX!

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The first one actually coincides with Margaret&#x27;s.. ARTHUR EMPLOYS 
AIR
&gt; &gt; HOLES.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The second ones says: YOU ARE GETTING THE EVIL EYE
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Third one says: YOU ARE VALUABLE
