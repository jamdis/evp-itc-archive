I was really appreciative of you providing the videos on the boxes.  One reason for my excitement is because I wanted to see the new RS 125 that I have ordered.  The other reason was because I want to introduce a techie type friend to this whole phenomena and I thought your presentation would be a good starting point.   After watching your video you satisfied my first interest, but I chose not to refer my friend to the video.   I found the video to be very interesting and I was only a little disappointed that responses to your questions did not come across to my ear.  But I could only imagine how a newbie like my friend would react.  Even though he is a techie, I think he would have wanted to HEAR something from the other side.  I felt that someone who did not previously know about the successful sessions that so many researchers have had here, would have experienced a guy talking to himself or, worse yet, asking\n questions to a radio and then answering himself.  Again, I think someone who takes the time to see such a presentation also wants to see the results.  After all, getting a message from the other end is the purpose of what&#39;s being done.  Audience expectations should not be underestimated.   Hope this helps.   Thanks again for the videos.
