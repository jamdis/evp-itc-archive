<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hard to get a perfect sweep, because it&#x27;s constantly changing. A sweep may be
good here at say setting #6 with 30 stations. But your sweep may be better at
#8 with only 20 stations. Not to mention atmospheric conditions and whether you
are inside or outside.

If you think that would work well for you, just mark the spot with a dab of
white out. If the condition changes, you can always scratch it right off.

&gt; This morning I did some minimal testing of Chris&#x27;s Ghost Box 1 RS-12-589, and I must say I did get some good messages, that were so clear that I did not have to use Clear Voice at all on them. I actually tested it on a crime case.
&gt; 
&gt; I think I am going to really like this radio, but still have much more testing to do before I start using it with my clients.
&gt; 
&gt; I sent Chris a note as I am still trying to figure out what the toggle switch on top is for.
&gt; 
&gt; Chris if you see this note, please tell me what that toggle switch is, and I have a suggestion for your next radio.
&gt; 
&gt; Steve Hultay you may need what I suggest too.
&gt; 
&gt; The silver dial that controls the speed of the scan, if you can add a circle label underneath that displays 1/8 line increments in a circular pattern, so we can turn the dial to each increment. What this will allow the user to do is mark the line increment that works best for recording.
&gt; 
&gt; For me I need to be able to turn the device on and record for a client, and it will be hard for me to try and find that sweet spot every time I record.
&gt; 
&gt; I am going to see if I can find or make a sticker to place under the dial.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, so far I love it! Especially knowing I will likely not need to use Clear Voice or any other software to bring clarity.
&gt; 
&gt; I will keep you informed.
