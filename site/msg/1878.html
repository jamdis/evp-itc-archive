<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s interesting, and some validation too. I used to do more Native 
American type stuff, like pipe cermony and vision quest, but won&#x27;t do it now 
cuz the guys forbid me touch tobacco. Actually I&#x27;m forbidden to smoke, and 
doing the Pipe might be too tempting.

&gt;We got references to wolf there weeks ago. In fact it just before you 
&gt;posted about wolf possibly having something to do with a quake. One of the 
&gt;researchers present with us named Maxx is a Native American is referred by 
&gt;others in his tribe as Grey Wolf. You had not yet posted about wolf meaning 
&gt;quake so we thought perhaps the messages we were hearing were for Maxx. It 
&gt;warned of traveling and the wolf.

&gt;where or when, same as the voices. They try but they said August 11th-and
&gt;China.
