&gt; &gt; EVP itself defies categorization. Some folks think it is a modulated em
&gt; field in proximity to the microphone. There is evidence to support this, as
&gt; evp has been recorded in faraday cages and vacuum jars. It would then be
&gt; logical to assume that evp is independent of vibratory sound waves. Then
&gt; that is blown to hell when you consider that Waldemar Bogoras is credited
&gt; with the first reported evp capture while recording rituals of the Tchoutki
&gt; tribe in Siberia in 1901. The was with a mechanical gramaphone-like device,
&gt; no microphone, just a horn to amplify sound, mechanical &quot;write&quot; needle, and
&gt; wax cylinder. Electric gramaphones didn&#x27;t come about till almost the &#x27;20s.
&gt; In that case it would appear that evp exists as soundwaves and not em
&gt; fields.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Which one is right? Both probably, and that isn&#x27;t even taking into
&gt; account the mechanism involved in box-related evp.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Intent and desire to communicate. The rest works itself out.

&gt; And all of this supports the notion that the real underlying principle is
&gt; actually psychokinesis, most likely of the operator but possibly of some
&gt; external agent as well. This would not require any external &#x27;power&#x27; in the
&gt; sense we normally think of it, and would explain why such voices are
&gt; recorded in powered and non-powered devices all using various recording
&gt; media. It would also explain the presence of audio and video since PK
&gt; appears to be an ability to affect the environment with the mind, which
&gt; could extend to manipulating or creating video and audio signals.
&gt;
&gt; In this context, conducting (or perhaps more correctly replicating) tests
&gt; in Faraday cages makes sense; in that one could then rule out anything
&gt; electromagnetic as a potential source. It may or may not be the case that
&gt; the sweep signal is critical to voice production. This is actually a notion
&gt; that needs further clarification - the presence of noise seems beneficial,
&gt; but is it required? Finding voices inside a Faraday cage in a replicated
&gt; test would actually be a very helpful outcome to advancing the research.
