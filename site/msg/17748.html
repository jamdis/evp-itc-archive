<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>If the box and EVP was the only source of information for 2012, I wouldn&#x27;t give it another thought--but being that every culture in the world has &quot;foreseen&quot; that date, I doubt if it was nothing they would mention it. It is not just a Mayan thing. Try the bible code, the Hindu vedic thingy, the I-ching, the torah, Mother Shipton, Nostradomus, Edgar Cacye. Some odd balls, like Merlin, and various ancient european predictions. See the History Channel for videos. Ancient Sumerian text about Planet X--unwise to discount that. It&#x27;s not hopeless though, according the bible code, already someone here that--might save the planet, and may have already done so if it is to be believed that the real date for 2102 was in 2006. That&#x27;s in the bible code as well. Butttttt-- what do I know?

 Sometimes, but rarely a prediction from the box hits, and there has been a few. the main problem ios getitng properly documented. 

 Where I get flustered with box voices is when I try to ask questions, or even when something like this June 17th thing is mentioned over an over, it&#x27;s like they try to give false and/or misleading information. 

 Fortunately, I remain intrigued with EVP just because something talks that shouldn&#x27;t be there, I don&#x27;t really care what they say. 

 Then there&#x27;s the problem that nothing is written in stone, it is often changable, or maybe just a probability/possiblity.
