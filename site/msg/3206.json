I honestly appreciate your views and the\nobvious thought put into your reply. \n\nYou are right, there is no harmony meter, no dark-guy scale, no way to\neffectively measure anything. What we do know, is that the &quot;dark-guys&quot;\ndo come through. Something happens that enable them as well as the\n&quot;light-guys&quot; to speak to us in real time. As of yet, we are unable to\nclaim with any certainty the possible effects of either on our world.\n\nI also agree that it is possible that they communicate through classic\nEVP as well. However, the communication is not in real time and to the\nbest of my knowledge a give and take conversation rarely occurs. With\nthe communication capable of coming through the box, a relationship\nbegins to form. A trust that when one turns on the box, he/she will be\nspoken to and be able to speak back in return. It is common belief\nthat the &quot;dark-guys&quot; can be quite deceitful. Why is that? Why not just\nannounce that they are the bad guys? There is a motive and intention\nto disguise who they are. What are they capable of? We simply can not\nsay with any certainty.\n\nI also can not say with any certainty that a portal can be opened. No\none can say that one can not be opened. I for one am not comfortable\nwith the &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude. I definitely see the positive\npossibilities from any sort of EVP. However, I see the enormous\npotential for negative. Enormous. To not see that is, IMO, short-sighted. \n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; My thoughts:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: babiarz3@...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I ask you to consider the fact that many who purchase the mini-box\n&gt; &gt; will not be of the right frame of mind. Most will not be in harmony.\n&gt; &gt; Many will take &quot;the dark guys&quot; seriously. Yet, you feel it&#39;s a good\n&gt; &gt; idea to let anyone who wants a box have one? All in the name of\n&gt; &gt; sharing technology.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; There is no such thing as a Harmony meter. There is no such thing as  \n&gt; a Dark Guy meter, nor an authorized comparative scale for the effects  \n&gt; of &quot;Dark Guys&quot; on people who are not &quot;In Harmony.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Honestly, what does In Harmony actual mean? Okay to play in the club  \n&gt; as per Raudive and Technician? How about Edison or Tesla? Or how  \n&gt; about not barking mad? Slightly depressed? Having a bad hair day? Not  \n&gt; a practicing &quot;fill-in-the-blank?&quot; And who is a Dark Guy? A dead human  \n&gt; with a bad attitude, a hellspawn demon, an alien, or nothing at all  \n&gt; except the accidental radio broadcast fragment?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Realize that I\n&gt; &gt; am not being selfish- I do not own a box. EVP is my passion and has\n&gt; &gt; been from day one 6 years ago when I jumped fully into the field. I am\n&gt; &gt; successful in capturing EVP, always have been. I still do it the &quot;old\n&gt; &gt; fashioned way&quot; with open air techniques.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you have similar concerns about your recorder? Isn&#39;t it also  \n&gt; capable of allowing the Dark Guys to interface with living humans?  \n&gt; Shouldn&#39;t the technology that was and is freely available to do  \n&gt; classic EVP have been and be vetted by an august body that would  \n&gt; study potential tapers against EVP&#39;s potential side effects,  \n&gt; including measuring them on the scale of Dark guys/In Harmony?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Would I love to be able to\n&gt; &gt; hold real time 2 way communications with the other side? Of course.\n&gt; &gt; However, I do not think enough research into the possibilities has\n&gt; &gt; been done to warrant the approval let alone production of these boxes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again I have to ask: what kind of research and by who?\n&gt; \n&gt; There is nothing exotic about the electronics of the box itself. It  \n&gt; can&#39;t *physically* hurt a person more than an a portable radio can--  \n&gt; and yearly few people die or are injured at the hands of  their  \n&gt; portable radios. What&#39;s left, and what it seems you&#39;re fearful of, is  \n&gt; potential psychic injury by the box rather than plain old blunt-force  \n&gt; trauma. I would submit that diagnosing psychic injury is not anymore  \n&gt; possible than diagnosing Harmony. And what it comes down to is that  \n&gt; the only people who can make up the body that researches and judges  \n&gt; whether the box should be approved are the very people who are using  \n&gt; it right now.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Those of us who have been on countless investigations with many people\n&gt; &gt; will quickly admit that there are some people we&#39;d rather not\n&gt; &gt; investigate with. When they are present, negative things tend to\n&gt; &gt; happen. We all know one or two people who we can say &quot;felt dark&quot; from\n&gt; &gt; the first meeting.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, you move away from those people because you don&#39;t like their  \n&gt; vibe. You drop them from the investigation team or join a new team or  \n&gt; investigate on your own, don&#39;t you? But you don&#39;t stop investigating  \n&gt; all together. Because you have a subjective feeling about someone is  \n&gt; not evidence that they are &quot;dark&quot; and shouldn&#39;t be allowed to have a  \n&gt; simple piece of electronic equipment.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; We all admit that being mentally sound is an\n&gt; &gt; important quality in this field. If you have mental issues, this may\n&gt; &gt; not be the area of research for you.\n&gt; \n&gt; While I agree with out on this point, it is also wonderfully true of  \n&gt; all careers, avocations, and hobbies, not just EVP research. If you  \n&gt; are nuts, you are going to act nuts in whatever activity or process  \n&gt; you&#39;re involved in. Unless your behavior crosses the line to  \n&gt; criminal, the rest of us have to deal with you in the traditional  \n&gt; away--avoidance. The only way that an out-of-Harmony type person can  \n&gt; hurt anyone else with a box is to hit them over the head with it,  \n&gt; electrocute them with it, scare them with it, or attempt somehow to  \n&gt; gain sway over them with it. All that they can do to themselves by  \n&gt; using it is hit themselves over the head with it, electrocute  \n&gt; themselves with it, scare themselves with it, or use it to bolster  \n&gt; whatever neuroses or psychopathies they have. And while that is  \n&gt; unfortunate, it is also true of everything from revival meetings to  \n&gt; household appliances.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; We don&#39;t bring children on\n&gt; &gt; investigations for obvious reasons. BUT! If you want a box that could\n&gt; &gt; possibly open up a portal and bridge the gap between here and the\n&gt; &gt; dark, sure! Anyone who wants one should have it!\n&gt; \n&gt; Wait--how do you know that when you use the box it opens a  \n&gt; &quot;portal&quot; (implying that something can come through into the physical  \n&gt; space where you are located) versus simply communicate over an  \n&gt; electronic device that tunes into frequencies that other phones  \n&gt; can&#39;t? I&#39;ve seen absolutely no evidence that anything can slither  \n&gt; through open cassette, reel-to-reel, digital, or box-induced doorways  \n&gt; to torment us. The person on the other end of a phone conversation,  \n&gt; no matter how evil, cannot undulate his way through the fiber optics  \n&gt; to axe murder us. We know that and we simply hang up and cut off the  \n&gt; conversation. If he calls back, we hang up again. While sometimes we  \n&gt; get EVPs that are rude, nasty, or mean, I think that 30 years of  \n&gt; research has shown us that whoever said, &quot;Screw you,&quot; on your tape  \n&gt; recorder is not also capable of slashing your tires. All they can do  \n&gt; is frighten you. That may be unpleasant, but it is this internal  \n&gt; biochemical process of your own body that leaves most lingering  \n&gt; effects, HMO.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You might feel that I am over reacting or being overly dramatic.\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s fine. My concern is not what you think of me but that you\n&gt; &gt; consider the possibilities here. Many of which we do not know. Can you\n&gt; &gt; be 100% sure that this is a good idea or that it&#39;s worthy of saying\n&gt; &gt; &quot;well, we&#39;ll see what happens&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; The question that I have for you is have you considered the enormous  \n&gt; amount of good that comes from use of the box or any EVP technique?  \n&gt; For every person who scares herself silly there at least a dozen, in  \n&gt; my opinion, who lose their fear of death. For every person who goes  \n&gt; on a power trip because they can contact spirits, there are a dozen  \n&gt; who share messages of hope all comers. The subjective evidence for  \n&gt; positive outcome outweighs the subjective evidence for negative  \n&gt; outcomes.\n&gt; \n&gt; HMO and YMMV,\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt;"}
