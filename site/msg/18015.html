<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Okay, well, I am going to put my bid in on this prize. This is the first time I have ever tried to do an experiment like this, so I have no clue as to if I am even close or not.  I came up with &quot;a rock&quot;.  I will make a folder in my name and post it so, if by chance it is right, you can listen to it ahead of time.

This is really interesting, even if I came up totally wrong.

&gt; RJ, I did not ask spirit for evidence, they have nothing to prove to me,  
&gt; because it is as i said before, this is subject to the listener for the most  
&gt; part.  They are real people over there just like here, and for this type of 
&gt;  communication to be coming out now was a part of God&#x27;s plan.  Except it  
&gt; not.  The Wright Brother&#x27;s were laughed at too, people thought flying was  
&gt; nuts!  Yet here we are today flying all over the place, lol everything  
&gt; material in existence today was once first in the realm of spirit or a  thought 
&gt; like state, I believe Jung called the prototypes  of everything,  Archtypes,  
&gt; Some might think of the Archtype for the person a guardian  angel of each 
&gt; spirit.sf

&gt; Three days left on this first experiment.
&gt; 
&gt; For those who say  skeptical people won&#x27;t listen to any evidence, here is a 
&gt; great way to provide  some publicly and prove or disprove that statement.
&gt; 
&gt; And if your&#x27;re just  the type who maintains an open mind, and would like to 
&gt; try to see what works  and what doesn&#x27;t, here&#x27;s an opportunity to 
&gt; participate in a multi-person  test.

&gt; &gt; I have placed  a little something on top of my computer monitor, right in 
&gt; front of me. It is  now 7/10/2010. I will leave it there 4 days, and remove 
&gt; it Noon Denver time,  on Wednesday, 7/14/2010.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; All you have to do is ask your  boxes/spirits/aliens/etc, what it is.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have taken a picture  of it, and posted it to the files section here, 
&gt; so there is no way I can  squirm out of the results:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; _http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip_ 
&gt; (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip) 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Please do not try to open the file before noon Wednesday. But feel  free 
&gt; to download it to your computer beforehand, so you can be sure I won&#x27;t  
&gt; change it during, or after, the test.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Answers anyone reveals  after noon Wednesday don&#x27;t count. Partial answers 
&gt; (like just the color, or  shape, or some emotion vibe) don&#x27;t count. Just 
&gt; tell me what it is.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Best of Luck. I hope for this to be a regularly occurring experiment,  
&gt; and I hope we all can learn from the results.
