<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This would seem to illustrate the divergence between schools of
thought with traditional evp and itc/rtsc. While using a faraday cage
to to prevent spurious and unwanted RF signals from contaminating a
microphone would be helpful for traditional evp, would it not be
counterproductive for box type ITC/RTSC? I am not trying to be
sarcastic or anything, I am just wondering if the idea here is to
ensure that if anything did make it through that it would most likely
be genuine? I would be afraid that the RF shielding would be too
effective thus blocking communication with a linear sweep box. If you
did get communication from a box in a faraday cage, it would certainly
make the skeptics and cynics be forced to present new arguments.

thanks,
Andy

&gt; While reading a book about spirit communication, there was a chapter 
&gt; which referenced the Faraday Cage.  So... after reading it I decided to 
&gt; try out what the book suggested and placed my Radio Shack Hack 12-470 
&gt; Ghost Box into my microwave oven (in the OFF position) and ran a sweep 
&gt; in the AM and FM mode.
&gt; The AM mode did receive much less but a few audio snippets did make 
&gt; their way through.  The FM mode was a different story. No frequencies 
&gt; at all made it through... just white noise as each FM frequency was 
&gt; reached during the sweep.
&gt; As I always do... I made a short video of both modes being sweeped.
&gt; You can see it, here:
