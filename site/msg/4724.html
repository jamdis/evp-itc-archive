Happy New Year!

found this forum and the intelligent and contemplative people that
frequent it!

I've been listening to recordings I took at my first private home
investigation last week, and had my first bona fide EVP today. I've
heard things in person, but this is the first time I actually had it
recorded and I'm psyched -- I think this next year is going to be a
doozie!

I'll post it once I've had a chance to isolate it in Audacity and
listen a few times. Anyway ~ 

Happy New Year and much progress & success in this next year!
