AAEVP  This is a good group, they have members that also do photos of
crystals that show faces in them when illuminated with light. I
attended a conference a few years ago they hosted in Atlanta, and
learned a lot about the world community that researches EVP and ITC.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This is just a note to let you know that the AA-EVP in now on You  
&gt; Tube at http://youtube.com/aaevp.  There are two videos (part 1 and  
&gt; 2) with testimonials from a few members of the Big Circle, including  
&gt; examples. We think they offer hope to all of us that our loved ones  
&gt; are okay on the other side. Please consider including the link in  
&gt; your website and sharing it with friends.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; There is also a banner with an embedded link at http://aaevp.com,  
&gt; which you can copy and paste into emails on your website.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We know that many of you who are receiving important contacts from  
&gt; loved ones are not in the video. Those who are were at the last  
&gt; conference and Lisa Huston, the producer of the video, had  
&gt; interviewed them.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We apologize if you have heard from us about the new video via other  
&gt; emails. We are trying to make sure everyone knows about them.
