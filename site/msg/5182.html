<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I would also like to jump in and add a spin on this unlabeled 
practice session.  If anyone has any questions for any of us, please 
e-mail us privately and let us know.  If we can try and answer some 
questions that only you would know the answer to it would add an 
enormous amount of validity to this research.  I do believe that some 
of us have great communication and may be able to get some answers to 
the questions asked.  If not, it&#x27;s still another practice session 
that can benefit us.  I know Bruce and i both have had questions 
answered that we did not know the answer to ourselves from other 
people involved.  This could be a project to consider.

&gt; Hey guy&#x27;s 
&gt; 
&gt; The unlabeled files experiment was a resounding flop!
&gt; 
&gt; Only a hand full of members responded with what they did or did not 
&gt; hear.
&gt; 
&gt; This is how I heard them
&gt; #4_There are three circles
&gt; 
&gt; #8_David&#x27;s just their guard
&gt; 
&gt; The percentage of people that responded that they heard what I had 
heard
&gt; was about 40% the individuals that heard some of what I heard but 
not 
&gt; all was about 30% with the remaining 30% hearing something 
completely 
&gt; different.
&gt; 
&gt; This type of experiment needs to be done on a regular basis with a 
&gt; substantial ammount of participents, otherwise the averages can not 
be 
&gt; calculated and a general theory formed that is acceptable to most 
&gt; researchers in this field.
&gt; 
&gt; If there is anyone else that would like to have a go at it I will 
be 
&gt; glad to participate.
