<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sure RetroCom,

According to WORLDITC there are many different devices using different
aspects of the radio and white-noise spectrum. Constantine Raudive
used germanium diodes to capture EVPs. Siedle built his psychophone,
George Meeks had the Spiricom tone device. Now you have the diode for
white noise, radio wave HF static, and a tone device. I am attempting
to build an all in one audio recording and communication device. I am
doing this to see if by having a combined unit you can get contact
with either one or the other or perhaps multiple contacts at one time.

&gt; Can you define with some detail &quot;all ways&quot; ?

&gt; 
&gt; This is my first post. I was wondering if anyone had created an all in
&gt; one ITC EVP device. I know that researchers such as Seidle had created
&gt; the psychophone that seemed to cover many aspects of ITC but I have
&gt; yet to see all ways of communication in one device.
&gt; 
&gt; I have created an all in one design that covers most of the devices
&gt; used. If you wish I will share the design.
