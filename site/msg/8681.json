Simply a capacitor of let&#39;s say 1 ï¿½F\nbetween the VT pin and ground, and a resistor of let&#39;s say 10 k between\nthe VT cable and the VT pin? This would perhaps smoothen the tuning\nvoltage during the scanning process.\n\nIs it possible that you try this quickly? It shouldn&#39;t take much time,\nand would be of great advantage if it worked...\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n\n \n \n&gt; Yeah, I was playing with trying to get rid of the clicking sound, and\n&gt; saw the VT pin. I found I could manually tune the radio with a volume\n&gt; control, or pot, so I had to make a board for it with a sweep\n&gt; generator. Now I wish I would have bought the shortwave version!\n&gt; Ahhhhh Box 36! Of course, Olgra(old and grumpy wife) isn&#39;t too happy\n&gt; at paying for a $25 radio that has just been gutted!\n \n&gt;  BTW, external tuning gets rid of the clicking, and the audio is surprisingly clear. \n \n \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; In a rush?
