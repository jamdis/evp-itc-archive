Yeah-I wondered about that. But I believe Adobe does have a freeware versio=
n, or a trial version. That maybe is what he is giving out. Ebay is pretty =
good and catching pirated software.

I know first hand, I was selling softw=
are on eBay for a while. Evidently one time I had gotten a hold of some pir=
ated software from one of my vendors, who probably didn't know it was fake =
either. Anyway, completely unbeknownst to me, I was selling a batch of fake=
 software. They caught it and told me it was counterfeit and to cease selli=
ng it, which I promptly did of course. LOL!!!

After that, I no longer trus=
ted the software I was getting, and got out of the software business.

  Actually, I'd report them t=
o eBay for giving away pirated software! :)  He says he will give you a cop=
y of Adobe Audition free.  I'd think adobe might have something to say abou=
t that...

     It's not fraud, these hack boxes work, it's just th=
