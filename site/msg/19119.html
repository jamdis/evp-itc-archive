<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I hear &quot;You&#x27;re on to something........&quot;  Really hard to understand this one.

There was an article in Popular Science recently that talked about the idea
that all we see, our 3d world, is a holographic projection; a false reality
based upon spacetime distortion.  A physicist at MIT is building a
specialized machine which is basically the most accurate clock (measuring
time by splitting laser beams) which will allow the light of the laser beam
over microseconds to be blown up and analyzed to see if time distorts.  I
can&#x27;t wait to read the results!  So yeah, it is possible that &quot;life is but a
dream.&quot;
