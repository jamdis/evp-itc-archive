<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree, I do think you attract entities more because they know you are &quot;open for business.&quot;  However, along with some people I didn&#x27;t know, I also had communication from those I did, and who had clearly been with me all along:  my dad, etc.  Before using the ghost box, my mom and I would experience phenomena around the house such as the tv being turned on, the gps suddenly turning on by itself and talking, a bottle of my dad&#x27;s booze being knocked over and broken.  After the ghost box, all that stopped, and instead, every morning after a ghost box session, I would get an image like a still photograph put into my mind the very first thing upon waking up.  My grandparents, my dad, my uncle, even my distant ancestors I&#x27;d never met, all of them were shown to me like they were at the age they were the most vibrant (before I was born), and always in a pose wearing clothes that didn&#x27;t match any photos.  During the dry spells when I haven&#x27;t used the box for months, no photos in my head.  

So I would definitely say somehow the box can enhance psychic ability.  I just would like to know HOW!

&gt; Hello,
&gt; I have been listening in and watching some of your videos. My name is San. 
&gt; I think once the spirits know that you are open for business, that they 
&gt; begin to know who you are and come to you. I can see many spirits on the ghost 
&gt; shows before the TV folks do. I get headaches and pains where the bullets 
&gt; went in around the same time that the other mediums on the shows do. Its a 
&gt; matter of intent, spiritual intent. You are letting them know that you are one 
&gt; that will listen and then they begin to show up. But it takes awhile for them 
&gt; to tune to your mind frequently but once they get used to it I guess it 
&gt; will just happen.

&gt; The random sounds make it easier to hear spirit voices in your head. I 
&gt; discovered this effect VISUALLY staining at rsndom dots on a viewing screen. In 
&gt; the visual mode the spirit only has to suppress the light spots and enhance 
&gt; the dark spots that do not match the image it is sending----Light and dark 
&gt; spots on the screen that correspond to the image dont have to be modulated at 
&gt; all---the result is a SAVING of &quot;psychic energy&quot; on the observers part, 
&gt; perhaps not much, but enough to make the difference between seeing and NOT 
&gt; seeing, however. Random sound would work the same way only the frequencies that 
&gt; did not match the sounds being sent would have to be blocked or replaced, 
&gt; the frequencies already present would NOT have to be modulated--so SOME energy 
&gt; is saved and not as much effort is needed to hear the entity. Effectively 
&gt; enhancing one&#x27;s innate abilities. It a lot easier to hear a spirit sound if 
&gt; some of the waves are already in place, than it would be if you had to build 
&gt; the entire word from scratch.

&gt; &gt; That doesn&#x27;t surprise me at all. I wish someone could figure out why 
&gt; using the box enhances one&#x27;s abilities as a medium, but apparently this is so -- 
&gt; I know it was true for me. As much experience as you have, Frank, it would 
&gt; seem to follow you&#x27;d have built up some considerable ability.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Went to the medium development class last night and OMG! Suprised 
&gt; myselff,
&gt; &gt; &gt; had no idea I could get visions on demand like that. I am uncertain if 
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; was due to being in a group with those expectations though. I&#x27;ve never
&gt; &gt; &gt; attempted to read for anyone before, always seems kinda presumptuous to 
&gt; me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; They do a circle for exchanging messages the third Friday of the month.
