Depending on how willing I am to reveal my age, I admit to between 20 and 30 years&#39; active research in ghost-related fields.\n\nToday, most people seem to associate me with my research to analyze & predict locations where paranormal activity will spike.  (It&#39;s not just ley lines.)\n\nMy goal is to refine those predictions so people can be in the right places at the right times, to use devices that will prove (and/or analyze) that something paranormal is going on.  \n\nRight now, one of our big problems is not knowing where to investigate for the best and most consistent results, and when to have the equipment set up.  (It&#39;s like surfing: I keep hearing people say, &quot;You should have been here yesterday...&quot;)\n\nThough I&#39;ve generally dismissed most EVP in the past, seeing Chris Moon&#39;s work at a recent event... that got my attention in a hurry.  \n\nI&#39;m very interested in anything that provides a voice to whatever-it-is people (including me, for convenience sake) tend to call &quot;ghosts.&quot;  \n\nI&#39;ve seen several not-impressive demonstrations of the Shack Hack, and then one that was vastly better, but it didn&#39;t make me run out and buy (or make) one.  I may need to revisit that.\n\nI&#39;ve used an Ovilus, which seemed to work okay for me, but I haven&#39;t seen the same compelling results in others&#39; hands... even with the same Ovilus.  (Then again, I don&#39;t ask questions. I&#39;ll talk to whatever-it-is, conversationally, but that&#39;s my limit. To me -- at least at this point -- it feels rather rude to demand a performance on cue.)\n\nThe box that Chris Moon had... it impressed me, big time.  I&#39;d like to understand who (or what) are talking, where they&#39;re actually talking from, and why they think it&#39;s important to tell us whatever they&#39;re saying.\n\nMy background is art and writing, not electronics.  So, I&#39;m not quite sure where to go from here.  I can manage simple electronics tweaks, but diagrams are beyond me, at least for now.\n\nAnyway, that&#39;s who I am and where I am with this concept.  I&#39;m delighted to find this group, and I can see lots of hours ahead, reading the Archives, etc.\n\nCheerfully,\nFiona Broome"}
