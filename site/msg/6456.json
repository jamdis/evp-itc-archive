The owner of this home asked if I\n&gt; would bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed with the\n&gt; immediately 2 way communication). So upon respectfully asking my tec\n&gt; if it was alright to do a session outside the my home we did several\n&gt; box sessions along with conventional EVP. We wanted to see if we could\n&gt; discover some unanswered history about the residence, and the  \n&gt; otherside\n&gt; was more than willing to comply.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were and are the\n&gt; most boring data to review. Something I use to love so much has\n&gt; actually turned into a project given I am waiting for a response\n&gt; immediately! Too funny how things can change overnight!\n&gt;\n&gt; I will be uploading some files for these sessions if you are  \n&gt; interested.\n&gt;\n&gt; Juli\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
