<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>To tell you the truth I guessed! This Radio is simular to the old 12-
470 it has two boards. When you open up the radio there is only ONE 
screw holding the first board. When you take that board off there are 
wires connecting the two boards together. I cut the wire which was 
connected to the board that said &quot;MUTE&quot; which was the second wire from 
the top on my radio. Then I followed that wire over to the second 
board and clipped that end too. I think you really only need to clip 
the one end but I wanted to make sure since I had no instructions to 
do the hack.
