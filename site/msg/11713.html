<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I thought it was pretty neat that it repeated the word &quot;worry&quot; when
Ryan asked if it was worried they&#x27;d bring in a priest.
What are the odds of that just based on environmental readings? If I

&gt; and
&gt; where they came up with this. To me, it sounds kind of like Frank&#x27;s Box, but
&gt; not the same.
&gt; Frank, please take a look at this, and tell us what  you think.
&gt; I don&#x27;t understand how it works......
