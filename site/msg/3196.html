<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello everyone, I thought I would introduce myself, my name is Lee 
and I own and host Pulse Talk Radio this is a show that is partly 
entertainment and partly informative. 

 Just lately we have been covering &quot;the Box&quot; mainly Joes box but 
always with reference to Franks, I have always been fascinated by 
EVP and progressive paranormal research equipment so I caught on to 
this subject rather quickly and it now has captured my imagination.

I&#x27;m not electronically minded but know what a capacitor and Micro 
chip look like and  I&#x27;m very good with theory&#x27;s and hope I can help 
with input into this amazing piece of equipment/subject, you may ask 
why should he be amazed by something he has only heard of and does 
not own, well I have been on a live box session over Skype and this 
box clearly said Hello Lee in response to a direct question,  now to 
a open minded sceptic like myself this was a revelation and now I&#x27;m 
hooked on the whole concept, not to say I&#x27;m a believer but very much 
in to researching the idea further

I would also like to say great job on Frank&#x27;s part for inventing the 
box, when you get to know me you will see what a mile stone it is to 
get me to sit up and take note such is my scepticism on the whole 
paranormal subject. I respect those that strive to make new 
equipment for us the paranormal investigation world, keep up the 
good work I will be watching closely for up dates and try and pitch 
my ten cents in when I thinks it&#x27;s warranted</pre>
