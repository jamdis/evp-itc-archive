<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello,

I have watched the forum here and not really participated a whole lot until now. The boxes have always been an interest to me, especially after a demonstration by Steve Hultay. I have been using a Shack Hack he gave me with some good success but I want to go the next level and build a box. I have an electrical engineer who is going to work with me and I was wondering where the best place to start would be. I have run across the schematics for box #1 on-line but know that there have been numerous upgrades and changes since then - not certain what number you&#x27;re at now Frank but was wondering where the best place to start would be and are there any schematics available of the later generations of the box available for us to expand upon?
