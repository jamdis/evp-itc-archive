<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>&quot;Today is not a day to become Little Miss Advice Giver, Kiera. If people ask
for your counsel, feel free to give it. However, if it is not specifically
requested, you are much better off keeping your opinions to yourself. This
is a much better day to loosen up about a current situation that may be
causing you stress. Do things that let you release and relax. Make sure you
are getting plenty of sleep.&quot;

 Wish they would send this stuiff in the morning!
