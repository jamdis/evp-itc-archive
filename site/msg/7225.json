I did a 10 min. session this morning and only went over \nthe first 1 min. so far, but wanted to share a couple.  The &quot;Seven&quot; \nfile may be pertaining to the &quot;seven&#39; we are all getting.  2 good \nmessages so far and i haven&#39;t asked a question yet....Maybe Frank is \nright?  If we listen, maybe they will tell us what we need to know and \ncould it be possible that our questions are sidetracking them from \ngetting their point across.  Just something to think about.\n\n-Steve H."}
