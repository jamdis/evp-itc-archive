&gt; Sounding good so far, Frank. You are right, the audio quality in these
&gt; prefabbed boomboxes is superior.
&gt;
&gt; In the AM boost clip I hear:
&gt;
&gt; .03 hultay
&gt; .07 find Tim
&gt;
&gt; The rest I believe is radio noise, especially Shanahan at the end. I am not
&gt; sure what the first word said in this clip is though, it may be a message of
&gt; sorts.
&gt;
&gt; In the first FM clip I hear:
&gt;
&gt; .03 alright
&gt; .04 Fay
&gt; .11 I don&#x27;t tape record the one (not very clear, but this is what it sounds
&gt; like to my ears)
&gt;
&gt; In the last FM clip I hear:
&gt;
&gt; .01 Getting called from me -or- Getting call from Dee
&gt; .06 Help people
&gt; .11 Right this hand (not very clear, but this is what it sounds like to my
&gt; ears)
&gt;
&gt; Nice work as usual!
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Just need a switch for the AM antenna amp. FM kinda noisy. &quot;PLL&quot;==phase
&gt; &gt; locked loop. This one has a delay when fiorst turned on, or when the band
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; changed, it has to wait for the sweep to bottom out before the sound
&gt; comes
&gt; &gt; on.
