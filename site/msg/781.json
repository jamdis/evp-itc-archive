Hopefully - he&#39;ll be sending me both the interim report and \nfinal report so I can put them in the &quot;Files&quot; area.\n\nGuy Jackson\nHuntington Beach, CA\nAudio Data Coordinator, Paranormal Research Investigations, Anaheim, \nCA\nMember AAEVP\nBSEE, 1980, University of Illinois at Champaign"}
