It is kind of like clearing\n&gt; your throat in the morning.  After this, for my boxes it takes about\n&gt; 20 seconds, I get a clear signal that lets me know communication is\n&gt; about to start.\n&gt; \n&gt; I almost always get this voice.  He comes across loud during an audio\n&gt; pause and yells the word &quot;NOW.&quot; Once I hear this, I know communication\n&gt; is about to start.  I have asked repeatedly who says &quot;Now&quot; but I never\n&gt; get an answer.  It is the same voice every time though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone else experience this?\n&gt; \n&gt; I ask this in particular because I was reading Raudive&#39;s book again\n&gt; and I noted that on page 23 (the section on radio recording) he wrote\n&gt; that when trying to find an interfrequency to record on (via direct\n&gt; radio voice) one &quot;listens carefully for a voice that will hiss &quot;Now,&quot;\n&gt; or &quot;Make Recording,&quot; or some such hint.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I find it interesting that the same clues are left for us 40 years\n&gt; after Raudive with a whole new technology (sweeping frequency radio).\n&gt; \n&gt; If you do not experience the same &quot;now&quot; as I do, are there any other\n&gt; consistent signals you receive from the other side?\n&gt; \n&gt; Tim\n&gt;"}
