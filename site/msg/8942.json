I ask if he will be there to help \nnew people and he answer &quot;let them help themselves&quot; then uses the \ncomputer term LOL for laugh out loud, then says they like us.\n\nIt just gets better and better. I am getting many more long sentences \nfrom our friends using this method. I will post more later.\n\nBruce"}
