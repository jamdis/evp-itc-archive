I listened to most of them and \nthought that &quot;Yes I&#39;ll be your guest&quot; from Frank&#39;s box came through \nvery clearly.\n\nI&#39;m just speaking for myself, but if one can upload some files without \ngiving away what one thinks it&#39;s saying (that is, don&#39;t type it out in \nthe title), then it might be more validating if people hear the same \nresponse independent of any suggestion on the part of the author.  I&#39;m \nsure this has been discussed before, but I&#39;d like to bring it up again \nfor comments.\n\nThanks,\nSharon\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Guy&#39;s \n&gt; \n&gt; posted some new files to the files section from Frank&#39;s box and the \nRS \n&gt; 470.
