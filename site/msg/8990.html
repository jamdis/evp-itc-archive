<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Jeremy.  If everyone knew about these support boards and that other resources are 
available to them, that would be one thing.  Obviously everyone here is aware of that.  But 
not everyone knows this place exists.  

And even if they do know about the boards here, how many would have the nerve to ask 
for help from strangers?  As Bruce recently shared, he gives people invitations to contact 
him privately in case they are too shy just ask a question publicly.  Which means, by the 
way, to some degree they have overcome some of that shyness in order to post whatever it 
was to begin with, which inspired him to make this offer.  What if they don&#x27;t even have the 
gumption to be anything more than be a look-i-loo?

I&#x27;m guessing many people are just surfing the net, checking out paranormal stuff, and run 
across the hacked boxes for sale.  

Again, I ask people who are taking the position you and Bruce are regarding profits ... do 
you have this same harsh sentiment toward Ron Ricketts, who makes and sells the 
MiniBoxes?  I realize he is passionate about this research and helping others.  Does that 
give him amnesty for making a profit?  

Personally I think we need to not be so judgmental.  At what point does &quot;profitable gain in 
the paranormal field&quot; become &quot;sickening?&quot;  I have a friend who is a medium.  I mean THE 
REAL DEAL.  He charges for his services.   The fee is reasonable compared to many in his 
field.  Does he do this because he&#x27;s a terrible person looking to take advantage of people?  
NO, he does so because he has been given a gift that changes people&#x27;s lives for the better.  
But he has to make a living... has to support himself in some way.  And because he has 
chosen to provide this service full time (and is not a trust fund baby), he makes a profit.  
This allows him to help far more people than he could if working some other kind of job 
and providing his services at no cost on the side.  

I realize this is not exactly the same thing as gouging people on the price for a 
commercially available product, but making such blanket statements about profitability in 
the paranormal field being sickening is rather short-sighted, in my opinion.  

I have a southern friend who likes to say, &quot;It&#x27;s a mighty thin plank that ain&#x27;t got two sides.&quot;  
I just don&#x27;t think we have the right to claim that simply because someone is offering a 
good and or service for profit to consumers in the paranormal market, that this 
automatically means they are taking advantage of other&#x27;s vulnerabilities.  

For Pete&#x27;s sake, no one is twisting the people&#x27;s arms to buy those units on eBay.  They are 
perfectly free to buy from whatever source they choose.  Since the units do work as 
claimed, we can argue that people have overpaid, shopped unwisely, or whatever.  I assure 
you this happens every single day throughout the retail market place with all types of 
products and services.    

I will say I have a fairly heathy dose of distain for charlatans/scam artists (of any flavor in 
any field) but that is not what we are talking about here.  We are talking about people who 
are offering legitimate products to consumers.  I&#x27;d rather see people doing this for profit, 
even when obscene, than running scams that damage people&#x27;s physical, mental, and/or 
financial well-being.

&gt; Very well put, Bruce.  Profitable gain in the paranormal field is sickening..  Unfortunately, 
there are those who continue to support the ones profiting, so it will continue.  It makes 
me sick that people take advantage of others vulnerabilities, especially when it comes to 
spiritual matters, but that&#x27;s a rant for another time and place.
&gt; 
&gt; If someone is afraid to try hacking a radio or lacks the proper tools, they are more than 
welcome to send them to me and I&#x27;ll do it for them and ship it back.  As Bruce said, it&#x27;s not 
for recognition, but it&#x27;s to help further the research.  I wouldn&#x27;t be doing this research if it 
wasn&#x27;t for Frank, Bruce, Steve and the others who put in their time and effort.  The 
possibilities are only limited by our willingness to work together.  The more we work 
together, the better the communication will get.

&gt;  
&gt; Do not give in to these demons that are trying to make a buck from the research we love 
and the equipment we use.
&gt;  
&gt; I have given away including the shipping 5 RS boxes for free, 4, 470&#x27;s and 1 469 all 
hacked by me.
&gt; I did not do it to gain popularity or even wanted a thank you. my sole motivation was to 
bring new people into the research and 
&gt; in turn change someones life and perpetuate the idea of strength in numbers, in this 
case strength of communication.
&gt;  
&gt; To all new people on this board, do not patronise these wolves that prey on the needs 
and wants of others. 
&gt; The RS 20 -125 is everything the 470 &amp; 469 are and a little more. do not let the size or 
complicated button arrangement scare you off.
&gt; the hack is as simple as the others. 
&gt;  
&gt; Do not buy any RS hacks from ebay, they are sold with the wrong energy attached to 
them, spirit wise.
&gt; That is why I and all other researchers should follow the example of a great man to 
whom we owe all of this research.
&gt; Mr. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to make a substantial amount of 
money from his boxes and
&gt; was offered the opportunity on a silver platter. But chose to follow what had been asked 
of him by higher entities.
&gt; And that was to keep the research pure for research sake. And that at no time was this 
equipment or knowledge there of
&gt; to be for monetary gain.
&gt;  
&gt; I adhere to this promise made by Frank to our friends on the other side and feel that 
there is no need to give in to these box 
&gt; extortionists. If a box is not attainable for a new person yet, the right way. Then it 
probably is not their time yet.
&gt;  
&gt; I have coined a phrase and believe in it. &quot;The researcher does not choose the box, the 
box chooses the researcher&quot;
&gt; Be patient, those that do not yet have a box. We will do all we can to help you obtain 
one.

&gt; No bodies at fault, but I would do the hack just to help more people get in this field.  As 
Bruce sayes the more people the better comunication we will have.

&gt; I just took a look at eBay and these are the NEW 12-469&#x27;s. 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, all I can say is the market is driven by BUYERS. If people are willing to pay, you 
can&#x27;t 
&gt; fault the person selling for taking advantage of what the market will bear. Perhaps the 
&gt; people who do not have the tools, or the skills, to do their own hack, feel this price is 
&gt; reasonable?

&gt; &gt; posted a 12-469

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the Raudive method with a germanium

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Radio shack only carries silicon, so I&#x27;ll have to order the 
&gt; &gt; germanium
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and give it a shot.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; You could also try a schottky diode which is more sensitive than a
&gt; &gt; &gt; german diode. See: http://en.wikipedia german diogerman digerma
