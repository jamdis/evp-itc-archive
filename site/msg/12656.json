Heckuva deal, anyone thinking of using\none of these coupons, you can print them off at radioshack dot com. I\ndidn&#39;t have one but got them to give me the discount anyway. Might\nprint off one and pickup a spare 12-469. Thanks Aaron for the heads up :)\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kolrone&quot; &lt;a.cronk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Good news for anyone looking to get new equipment. I went into\n&gt; Radioshack today and they handed me a coupon for 30% off Radioshack\n&gt; products and 10% off additional products. I bought the 20-125 for\n&gt; about $30. So that is a nice discount. I almost wanted to by other\n&gt; stuff but I decided to wait off on it. The coupons expire on 11/2 so\n&gt; try to get to your local Radioshack. I don&#39;t know if they are giving\n&gt; away the coupons everywhere, but I also got an email about the\n&gt; discounts, so there is a good chance they are. Good luck.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Aaron\n&gt;"}
