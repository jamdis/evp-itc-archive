But\n&gt; everything else I have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; heard so far in the files here is not\n&gt; striking me as the voice of any\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; apparition, due to the weakness of quality.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If you&#39;re still reading this, I have to\n&gt; tell you I have had striking\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; results in my own home, simply letting a\n&gt; recording device roll, and if\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you&#39;re not yet interested in hearing\n&gt; these samples, I guess you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more into the box than the afterlife and\n&gt; that&#39;s YOU, not me! :)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; LOVE,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Katherine.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Checked by AVG - http://www.avg. com\n&gt; &lt;http://www.avg. com&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Version: 8.0.169 / Virus Database:\n&gt; 270.6.21/1671 - Release Date: \n&gt; &gt;&gt; 9/14/2008 7:16 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ____________ _________ _________ _________ _________\n&gt; _________ ___ \n&gt; Click here for free search of religious schools located\n&gt; near you.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; ____________________________________________________________\n&gt; Boost your productivity with new office software.
