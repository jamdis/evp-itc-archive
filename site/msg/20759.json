This is a file I got on my RS 20-125 over the holidays.  It is similar to the last file I just posted.  At one point I have to have the courage to go out on a limb even if I&#39;m wrong: I think it might be talking about soul judgements. \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Adriana%27s%20Files/weholdthespiritinnocent.mp3 \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html\nRegards,\n\nadrianamjones &lt;adrianamjones@...&gt;"}
