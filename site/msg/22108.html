Wow so much for unity and research for the common good of all. I really don=
t give a rat's ass what anything is called as long as people keep researchi=
ng,experimenting and building things. If one doesnt work, oh well we just t=
ake it back to the bench and build a new one, to hell with what is it calle=
d or who built it. I have hacked over=C2=A025 different=C2=A0radio brands a=
nd/or models=C2=A0and by hack I dont mean just snipping a wire, some I=C2=
=A0 turn it into little pieces and start over with a whole new 2,3 or even =
a 4 brand hybrid. And by then the name of it ,or even who I am, is irreleve=
nt the only thing that matters is "does it work or not?" Not trying to piss=
 on any shoes but this just got really weird, really quick and we (the buil=
ders)dont matter the only thing that should is the equipment and what it ca=
n do. Sorry if I offended anyone.

1-Calling an Ed=
ison box is sham and scam. A way of trying to lend credbility to it, and re=
move me from box history, and it does look suspicioulsy like what I make. I=
t is also ignoring all EVI-ITC history of the last one hundred years. How m=
any here realize the ghost box, or radio sweep method used to be called Dir=
ect Radio Voice, and has long history? I have never heard any stories of Ed=
ison getting radio contacts wioht spirit.
How many have even done five minu=
tes of research on the history of EVP. I can tell ya, none! No, y'all want =
to sit in the dark and ask what color your shirt is then claim to be great =
researchers and experts. 

2-I doubt that it truely random, I'd like to see=
 a scope vid of the sweep modes. 

I wouldn't have problem, but these peopl=
e like the one putting on this video belittle and insult me in public. For =
what? For their own fame and fortune. Then try to copy Chirs Moon, and blam=
e the concept on Edison--freaking
 clueless, all of you!
