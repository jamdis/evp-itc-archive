<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My sympathies! That story seems all too common in this society. It 
may take some time, first the spirit has to realize where they are, 
and then learn how to communicate. They seem to hear our thoughts, so 
I&#x27;m sure your mother knows what was going on and how you feel.

&gt; My mom just passed away on the 21st of Feb and I wasnt able to see 
her for the past year or so mostly due to the fact that my sister was 
selfish and wouldnt tell me what nursing home she put my mom in.  She 
sold my mom&#x27;s house and property and gave her stuff to goodwill...and 
she had the nerve to tell me via informal and rather rude email that 
my mom passed and what a burden it was to her the past few months 
taking care of her.  I know my mom knows that I loved her and will 
always...but I dont know if she knows what my sister did to keep me 
from her and I feel like a horrible daughter...not getting to see her 
before she passed.  I finally got her address and phone number in a 
christmas card she sent me and I was able to call her for like 10 
mins before she had to go eat...and when I tried calling back that 
night and several times after I only got her machine.  I wanted to go 
see her but didnt have a way to get all the way to where she 
was...not even the public buses run to
&gt;  where the nursing home was.
&gt;    
&gt;   Ive tried doing some EVPs to see if there was a chance of 
contacting her...I know ya dont usully get what ur looking for...but 
Ive gotten nothing at all.  So Im wondering....is there anyone who 
has done a skype session for this type of situation and gotten any 
success?  And would you be willing to do a skype session with me?(Tho 
I have no idea how that would even work, Id be willing to try...heck 
just to be able to listen to a session would be awesome)  
&gt;    
&gt;   Thanks,
&gt;   Rhonda
