<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>For Some, i guess it would be an option.

I change the design almost daily now to try new things.  As you wrote me in an e-mail:

&quot;get a f&amp;@%ing life and stop using other peoples ideas&quot;

I took what you said to heart, so i&#x27;m always trying new things now.  

Thanks for the push,
-Steve

&gt; Even though the 12-589 radio is a piece of crap, i still try and work on it to make it better.  I finally got all the voltages to match using the TS924IN op amp, but it still sucks.
&gt;  
&gt; I love this chip though, really blows away the LM324 that i had been using.  Thanks Jeff for letting me know about it.  If it wasn&#x27;t for Jeff guiding my path, i&#x27;m not sure i&#x27;d be doing anything worthwhile.
&gt;  
&gt; I think 2011 is the year i start understanding more, some stuff is actually making sense to me lately.  I&#x27;ve attached 2 videos with the new set up in this radio.
