    April yo=
u might be interested in researching some others who are/were involved in E=
VP-ITC communication. Marcello Bacci, Hans Otto Koenig, George Meek, Ernst =
Senkowski, Adolph Holmes, Sonia Rinaldi, just to name a few. Researchers ac=
ross the world explore this in great detail.

  Many experiments are done w=
ith that idea in mind such as the spiricom experiemnts past and present, di=
rect voice communications, Frank's box, and various other methods.

  Frank=
 R just pointed out a great video that was posted interviewing Dr. Ernst Se=
nkowski in which he gives an interesting viewpoint and some what he says mi=
rrors my own point of view as well as info being given via EVP on many topi=
cs. He also speaks about some of the various researchers he knew.

  http:/=
/vimeo.com/5637666

  There is so much going on in the world that most peop=
le in the USA have very little knowledge of simply because they do not spea=
k the language that the info is being presented in. There are some videos o=
f other researchers on the web as well and if you can get past the language=
 differences you may find some of their work to be very fascinating.
