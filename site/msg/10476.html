 So humbling to try to talk to this group with so many years experience, a=
nd the intellects! Very humbling! 
 
 If I may be so bold as the to suggest=
 this voice is Raudive, as he has a very distinctive tonal quality. Secondl=
y, there was concerns that little technical advice is received, just my sma=
ll minded opinion, but we have the electronics, and the boxes in various fo=
rms work. There is little more to this type of device, except as in this vo=
ice, some minor tweaking of components.
 
 "A copper box" go to Radio Shack=
, buy copper clad circuit board, cut to desired size, solder togother with =
gun type soldering iron (I think it's 120 and 300 watts). Drill holes for m=
ic and speaker. Of course, that's just the way I would do it. There has to =
be a much simpler, cheaper, and better way. 
 
 Thank your for you time, so=
rry for the intrusion.
