Auto tuning would produce the same results and is less fatiguing on the operator. Any method that can produce clean audio samples at this rate should work, I have tried a few different ways, the radio tuning being the best so far. As with any method &#39;intention&#39; seems to be a factor in getting any results. The linear tuning of a radio is a true random method. The content of each broadcast channel is always changing, so the audio samples are always different sweeping back and forth across the spectrum. Heres a couple more from the 7/8/07 session.\n\n&quot;This level, costing us netlink&quot; (I have heard this term &#39;netlink&#39; a few times before)\n\n&quot;You can have children with the lightning....I knew that&quot;\n\nDave\n\nRe: Question for all &quot;Frank&#39;s ghostbox&quot; owners \n\n\nThat&#39;s pretty impressive, this is all manually tuned? Do you have\nany other files. Granted a box is easier to just turn on and go,\nbut it&#39;s amazing that you can get similar results manually.\n\nGood job\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Not using a formal box, manual linear FM sweep with an optical\ninterface to the recorder.
