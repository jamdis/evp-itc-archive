<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all,

A friend of mine and fellow researcher, Keith Clark (who many of you 
know from ITCBridge.com or elsewhere)has begun a new project which 
broadcasts live 24/7 online. Keiths methods differ from my own but I 
have been recording with him for a couple years and am happy to see 
he took his idea and made it a reality. 

His project has had some great results for me personally and I 
thought I would share it with you all so you may partake of this and 
help to further the research. I have had both image and audio results 
which I have posted a few here:

http://www.esnips.com/web/ITCBridge

Check those out first to get an idea of what I mean. 

After that heres some links to get you started for those who want to 
join us and help make a difference. The first two (*) have chat 
enabled so you can chat with whoevers watching with you as well as 
Keith when he is on. This broadcast is simulcast to the following 
website pages:

*Ustream.tv: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/itc-bridge-radio-project

*Best Psychic and Spiritual 
Network:http://www.bestpsychicnetwork.info/group/itcbridgeradiocollabo
