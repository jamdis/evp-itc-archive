I have\nlisted box 6 on ebay.  I will use ALL the money from the sale to buy\nSpeakjet Chips.  They cost $30.00 each!  I have all the parts for 10\nmore boxes and just need the chips.  I was going to put one a month\nout but I really want to get them out faster than that.  So if all\ngoes well I will send out many boxes in the next couple weeks.  The\nlisting is under Speakjet Box EVP Ghost box Paranormal.\n\nThanks Rob."}
