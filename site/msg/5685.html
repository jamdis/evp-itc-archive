&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   Robin:
&gt; 
&gt;   From my perspective your first sentence is key in summing up the 
&gt;   various viewpoints from people...the word &quot;believe&quot; stands out. 
You 
&gt;   posted, &quot;I&#x27;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I 
&gt;   absolutely BELIEVE in the power of prayer, the power of 
positivity, 
&gt;   and the power of ritual.&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt;   Belief... I think whatever works to keep a person from fear is 
the 
&gt;   ticket. Fear is when we hand power over to something else and 
become 
&gt;   its slave. Your post states that you &quot;absolutely believe&quot; - that 
is 
&gt;   your power, mentally used by you to not succumb to fear, and thus 
&gt;   remain in control. ;)
&gt; 
&gt;   I might further point out that there is something more powerful 
than 
&gt;   belief in my opinion, and that has been the reason behind my 
&gt;   pursuits. I suggest that what a person KNOWS as truth is even 
better 
&gt;   than belief. Truth is eternal and has no opposite.

&gt;   &gt; I&#x27;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I 
absolutely 
&gt;   believe in the power of prayer, the power of positivity, and the 
&gt;   power of ritual. When I first started recording EVP a couple of 
&gt;   years ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when it 
&gt;   happened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or 
distressed. I 
&gt;   will ask again: What physical or psychic harm is a disembodied 
&gt;   entity capable of doing? Please listen to the one EVP I&#x27;ve posted 
on 
&gt;   this board and tell me what, if anything, you hear. I know what I 
&gt;   hear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is the 
&gt;   response that has created the determination in me to continue 
&gt;   researching the unknown. 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings. I only want to learn as 
&gt;   much as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on 
this 
&gt;   board. It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in the 
&gt;   past, and that&#x27;s about all I can say. I will probably use one 
from 
&gt;   this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract 
&gt;   goodness. 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; So, thank you for this contribution. I think the debate has 
been 
&gt;   an excellent one, and I&#x27;ve appreciated the opportunity to be 
&gt;   enlightened.

&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; I swore I would not get wraped up in this debate
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; BUT!
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; The reason I came up with this whole protection ritual was that 
&gt;   some 
&gt;   &gt; of the new researchers where
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; expressing a rational concern for negative responces that they 
&gt;   were 
&gt;   &gt; recieving through thier boxes.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; The short protection ritual that I posted is not meant to quell 
&gt;   &gt; irrational histerical fear, and I agree
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; with rosemary that anyone suffering from such fear should 
rethink 
&gt;   &gt; thier involment in the paranormal research field.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; that being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal 
&gt;   comfort 
&gt;   &gt; to those new individuals that had never 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; expperienced spiritual negativity. And to help ease them into 
&gt;   &gt; aproaching a session eventually with confidence
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; and determination as well as full curiousity for all types of 
the 
&gt;   &gt; communication we recieve.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; My initial post of the ritual file was done with the best of 
&gt;   &gt; intentions and meant to be another tool available for those who 
&gt;   felt 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; they needed or wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent 
&gt;   prayer 
&gt;   &gt; ritual, I don&#x27;t think it is really worthy of all this debate.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; Use it, don&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s there if you want it. Also I must 
say 
&gt;   &gt; there are two kinds of fear the kind that is natural and a god 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; given emotion for self preservation, ie the fright and flight 
&gt;   reflex 
&gt;   &gt; that is an instinctive trait in all of us. Then you have the 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; irrational dibilitating phobic fear that can turn an individual 
&gt;   into 
&gt;   &gt; a frozen statue. That type of fear I believe is unhealthy
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; and should be addressed and dealt with and learned how to 
&gt;   harness. I 
&gt;   &gt; also believe that anyone that harbors that type of fear 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a case of 
such 
&gt;   &gt; fear it would already be present and doing a small protection 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take it for what 
it 
&gt;   is, 
&gt;   &gt; something to utilize in our box of tools like an emf meter.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the bottom of 
your 
&gt;   tool 
&gt;   &gt; box at home that you inherited from your grandfather and have 
&gt;   never 
&gt;   &gt; used
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; but if you come across that odd nut that needs tightening 
somedsy 
&gt;   you 
&gt;   &gt; will be glad you have it.
