<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve gotten &quot;7&quot; numerous times with FB#21 but not with the Shack Hack
469. Also, with FB we were getting the voice of someone we know who
currently has a mysterious nerve disorder. All of the suggested causes
have been ruled out although the symptoms remain but are treatable. We
were surprised to hear his voice which was later joined by another
person we know who is also living. The person with the nerve disorder
said &quot;Tuesday&quot; several times. I called the gentleman on the phone to
tell him about our Box session and he told me they had decided several
days prior that they were going to hold ITC experiments on the first
Tuesday of every month. He runs a small paranormal team and I&#x27;ve had
Box sessions with them already. -Bill

&gt; I just got my Joe&#x27;s Box #2 back, which is what i started with and had 
&gt; much success.  I did a 10 min. session this morning and only went over 
&gt; the first 1 min. so far, but wanted to share a couple.  The &quot;Seven&quot; 
&gt; file may be pertaining to the &quot;seven&#x27; we are all getting.  2 good 
&gt; messages so far and i haven&#x27;t asked a question yet....Maybe Frank is 
&gt; right?  If we listen, maybe they will tell us what we need to know and 
&gt; could it be possible that our questions are sidetracking them from 
&gt; getting their point across.  Just something to think about.
