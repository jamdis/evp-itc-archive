<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Lol! Gender has little to do with it. 90% of everything I do, I have 
no idea why, it&#x27;s all intuition based, I live moment to moment, there 
is no plan. I can only make just so many of these things, I&#x27;m not a 
company, I can&#x27;t just whip them out, especailly since I refuse to go 
down that slippery road of making money off spirit. I have already 
past the point where I dread working on them. 

 There&#x27;s nothing special about the box, it simply provides the raw 
audio sprits/entities use to form voices. There are a number of 
methods that result in much clearer, much more coherent messages. So 
far, in my opinion, the box is piss poor at best. It works, but it 
could be a hell of alot better. The Mini Box is better, and I think I 
prefer that direct mode of operation, and have incorporated it into 
two boxes as experiments in development. I get much more consistent 
contacts from EVPmaker, which was invented long before the box. 

 The only thing most know about the box is what&#x27;s put out in public 
shows, and 90% of that is crapola.
