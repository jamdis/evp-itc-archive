If everyone knew about these support boards and that other resources are \navailable to them, that would be one thing.  Obviously everyone here is aware of that.  But \nnot everyone knows this place exists.  \n\nAnd even if they do know about the boards here, how many would have the nerve to ask \nfor help from strangers?  As Bruce recently shared, he gives people invitations to contact \nhim privately in case they are too shy just ask a question publicly.  Which means, by the \nway, to some degree they have overcome some of that shyness in order to post whatever it \nwas to begin with, which inspired him to make this offer.  What if they don&#39;t even have the \ngumption to be anything more than be a look-i-loo?\n\nI&#39;m guessing many people are just surfing the net, checking out paranormal stuff, and run \nacross the hacked boxes for sale.  \n\nAgain, I ask people who are taking the position you and Bruce are regarding profits ... do \nyou have this same harsh sentiment toward Ron Ricketts, who makes and sells the \nMiniBoxes?  I realize he is passionate about this research and helping others.  Does that \ngive him amnesty for making a profit?  \n\nPersonally I think we need to not be so judgmental.  At what point does &quot;profitable gain in \nthe paranormal field&quot; become &quot;sickening?&quot;  I have a friend who is a medium.  I mean THE \nREAL DEAL.  He charges for his services.   The fee is reasonable compared to many in his \nfield.  Does he do this because he&#39;s a terrible person looking to take advantage of people?  \nNO, he does so because he has been given a gift that changes people&#39;s lives for the better.  \nBut he has to make a living... has to support himself in some way.  And because he has \nchosen to provide this service full time (and is not a trust fund baby), he makes a profit.  \nThis allows him to help far more people than he could if working some other kind of job \nand providing his services at no cost on the side.  \n\nI realize this is not exactly the same thing as gouging people on the price for a \ncommercially available product, but making such blanket statements about profitability in \nthe paranormal field being sickening is rather short-sighted, in my opinion.  \n\nI have a southern friend who likes to say, &quot;It&#39;s a mighty thin plank that ain&#39;t got two sides.&quot;  \nI just don&#39;t think we have the right to claim that simply because someone is offering a \ngood and or service for profit to consumers in the paranormal market, that this \nautomatically means they are taking advantage of other&#39;s vulnerabilities.  \n\nFor Pete&#39;s sake, no one is twisting the people&#39;s arms to buy those units on eBay.  They are \nperfectly free to buy from whatever source they choose.  Since the units do work as \nclaimed, we can argue that people have overpaid, shopped unwisely, or whatever.  I assure \nyou this happens every single day throughout the retail market place with all types of \nproducts and services.    \n\nI will say I have a fairly heathy dose of distain for charlatans/scam artists (of any flavor in \nany field) but that is not what we are talking about here.  We are talking about people who \nare offering legitimate products to consumers.  I&#39;d rather see people doing this for profit, \neven when obscene, than running scams that damage people&#39;s physical, mental, and/or \nfinancial well-being.  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Early Cuyler &lt;ecuyler@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Very well put, Bruce.  Profitable gain in the paranormal field is sickening..  Unfortunately, \nthere are those who continue to support the ones profiting, so it will continue.  It makes \nme sick that people take advantage of others vulnerabilities, especially when it comes to \nspiritual matters, but that&#39;s a rant for another time and place.\n&gt; \n&gt; If someone is afraid to try hacking a radio or lacks the proper tools, they are more than \nwelcome to send them to me and I&#39;ll do it for them and ship it back.  As Bruce said, it&#39;s not \nfor recognition, but it&#39;s to help further the research.  I wouldn&#39;t be doing this research if it \nwasn&#39;t for Frank, Bruce, Steve and the others who put in their time and effort.  The \npossibilities are only limited by our willingness to work together.  The more we work \ntogether, the better the communication will get.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: bruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;\n&gt; To: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, April 5, 2008 11:15:21 AM\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] boxes on ebay\n&gt; \n&gt;                 Guy&#39;s\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do not give in to these demons that are trying to make a buck from the research we love \nand the equipment we use.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have given away including the shipping 5 RS boxes for free, 4, 470&#39;s and 1 469 all \nhacked by me.\n&gt; I did not do it to gain popularity or even wanted a thank you. my sole motivation was to \nbring new people into the research and \n&gt; in turn change someones life and perpetuate the idea of strength in numbers, in this \ncase strength of communication.\n&gt;  \n&gt; To all new people on this board, do not patronise these wolves that prey on the needs \nand wants of others. \n&gt; The RS 20 -125 is everything the 470 & 469 are and a little more. do not let the size or \ncomplicated button arrangement scare you off.\n&gt; the hack is as simple as the others. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Do not buy any RS hacks from ebay, they are sold with the wrong energy attached to \nthem, spirit wise.\n&gt; That is why I and all other researchers should follow the example of a great man to \nwhom we owe all of this research.\n&gt; Mr. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to make a substantial amount of \nmoney from his boxes and\n&gt; was offered the opportunity on a silver platter. But chose to follow what had been asked \nof him by higher entities.\n&gt; And that was to keep the research pure for research sake. And that at no time was this \nequipment or knowledge there of\n&gt; to be for monetary gain.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I adhere to this promise made by Frank to our friends on the other side and feel that \nthere is no need to give in to these box \n&gt; extortionists. If a box is not attainable for a new person yet, the right way. Then it \nprobably is not their time yet.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have coined a phrase and believe in it. &quot;The researcher does not choose the box, the \nbox chooses the researcher&quot;\n&gt; Be patient, those that do not yet have a box.
