He specializes \nin implants and the such.  When I met him I attempted to talk with him \nabout one of the shows I saw him on where he was using a certain meter \nnear the implant he had removed.\nHe was receiving frequencies, but they appeared to be coming, not from \nthe implant, but from the entire area he was measuring.\nHe really didn&#39;t want to listen to me... I guess some of those guys \nhave their agendas or strong opinions and want to stick to them.\nMost of those implants look like splinters to me... :-)\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, black bear hollow &lt;blackbearhollow@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; History Channel has a show on UFOs and implants that emit FM and \nother  \n&gt; radio frequencies. You might be interested in seeing this.\n&gt;"}
