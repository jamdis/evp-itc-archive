Hello, all.

My name is Michelle. I'm a certified medium =
with a Spiritualist church. This was a two year process which involved prov=
ing I can communicate with spirits to a congregation (not bragging - just t=
rying to explain my background and why I know what I do). I'm also one of t=
he biggest skeptics you'll ever meet (It was one of two reasons I became a =
medium. I wanted to see how they were "faking" it. Surprise! They weren't).=
 I'd like to contribute what I've learned about spirits. As Jill wrote, "I(=
t) really takes personal experience to believe this stuff exists".


As to =
her main question of "Why do spirits lie", I don't think we can always assu=
me they're lying. If the information comes through a medium, one of the fir=
st items to address is whether or not the medium received the message corre=
ctly and then whether or not he/she interepreted it correctly and phrased i=
t in a way that allowed the recipient to understand the spirit's meaning. T=
here are a variety of ways spirits communicate with mediums; some are easie=
r than others to understand and pass on. For the harder methods, it would b=
e possible for a medium to inadvertently misinterept the message based on h=
is/her past experiences. 


When we look at the question from the connectio=
n to EVP's and ghost boxes, we have to examine a few items. Was the spirit =
able to use the devices correctly to form the words he/she actually intende=
d? This is a two step process. It can be difficult for them to not only pul=
l the available energy into a useable form, but to also form the correct wo=
rds (think it as a foreigner learning English and saying "car" when they me=
an "star". They sound similar, but have very different meanings). 


Did we=
 understand the words they said? It's fairly easy to get them wrong, especi=
ally in instances where you aren't the first person to listen to the record=
ing and someone else says, "Here listen to this. I think they're saying (fi=
ll in the blank)". Our brains are going to tell us (fill in the blank) simp=
ly because that thought is now prevalent. If we're the only person listenin=
g to the recordings, the same mistake can be made. The only conclusive way =
is to use equipment that can amplify and break down the recordings to make =
them clear enough to be agreed upon by a number of people who don't know wh=
at conclusions the other listeners have drawn. 


The idea of a spirit dist=
orting the facts must also be considered. Not lying, per se, but rather get=
ting the facts within their reality confused. This is where you have the ri=
ght to have the facts validated by the spirit. Ask them to prove it to you.=
 They can tell you some corresponding items that back up their claims, dire=
ct you to old newspaper stories or to a person they used to affiliate with =
or bring the validation into your focus (meaning the same thing comes into =
your life while you're driving/working/ at home/talking to someone/reading =
and etc.) at least three times. A spirit who is being truthful will not min=
d trying to make this happen. 


Once these have been considered and elimin=
ated, then we should be willing to entertain the idea the spirit may be a l=
ower energy being (a bully/swindler/ con-man or woman/narcissist and etc) i=
n their past life and this is the only way they know how to achieve what th=
ey want. And yes, those spirits do exist. "As in life, so in death", meanin=
g our personalities don't change when our bodies die.


Al, maybe he wasn't=
 trying to prove anything. Is it possible the spirit voice didn't mean he W=
AS (typed larger for emphasis) Steve Tate, but rather wanted to talk ABOUT =
Steve Tate or get a message TO Steve Tate? Did he mean to say "Still fate"?=
 Could he have meant "paratrooper" ? See where I'm going with this? 


And =
finally, in regards to the "end of the world stuff", it has been taught to =
me by mediums and teachers who were all very honest and excellent at what t=
hey do, and it has been relayed to me by spirits I've encountered in my med=
iumship service that we don't have a free glimpse of the future once our bo=
dies die and we move into spirit form. I mean no offense and I'm not impyin=
g that wasn't what was heard. That said (or rather 'typed'), I'd be VERY he=
sitant to believe this communication. There are beings that are privvy to t=
he potential (underscore "potential") future in our lives, but it isn't the=
ir nature to join us for EVP sessions. 


I hope I haven't taken liberty wi=
th this forum by posting such a long reply. I thank you for your time and a=
ttention. If you have other questions or would like me to clarify something=
, please ask. I'd be honored to share what I know and track down what I don=
't. :)
