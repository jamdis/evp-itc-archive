This makes this stuff look complicated too, and I wish I could avoid \nthat. I don&#39;t want it to look like exotic technogolgy, it&#39;s just radio! This \nis amy first attemp[t at trying th use the stereo outputs of a tuner, I used \nto just mix them together, but every once in awhile I get voices that have \nreally weird phase thing, where they sound like they speak in front of the \nspeaker, especially on the computer speakers. I&#39;m using only one pick up mic \nmounted opposite, but between the two speakers. I didn&#39;t have enough board \nspace to add another mic channel with a limiter citrcuit that I like to use.\n\nThe micro board is from last spring, I sued one side for th RVG, the ohter \nwas all the audio, all I had to do was connect this to a tuner.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN is giving away a trip to Vegas to see Elton John.ï¿½ Enter to win today. \nhttp://msnconcertcontest.com?icid-nceltontagline\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_450e_1272_16f1\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;Here&#39;sLookin&#39;,AtUKid.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;Here&#39;sLookin&#39;,AtUKid.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_450e_1272_16f1\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;Stereo-Box.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;Stereo-Box.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_450e_1272_16f1\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;Corner.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;Corner.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_450e_1272_16f1\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;MicroBroad-RVG.JPG&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;MicroBroad-RVG.JPG&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_450e_1272_16f1--"}
