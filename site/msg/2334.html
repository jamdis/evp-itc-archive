It would be intriguing and awesome to witness someone in their native tongue having a discussion with them. One of my major interests are evps in other languages. Say in Thailand, do they come across in Thai, or in English?

        Frank,
  When native americans come across, or when people of other ethnic regions come across, do they speak in their native tongue?
