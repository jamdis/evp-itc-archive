<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just bought a 12-150 for 34.99. Heckuva deal, anyone thinking of using
one of these coupons, you can print them off at radioshack dot com. I
didn&#x27;t have one but got them to give me the discount anyway. Might
print off one and pickup a spare 12-469. Thanks Aaron for the heads up :)

&gt; Good news for anyone looking to get new equipment. I went into
&gt; Radioshack today and they handed me a coupon for 30% off Radioshack
&gt; products and 10% off additional products. I bought the 20-125 for
&gt; about $30. So that is a nice discount. I almost wanted to by other
&gt; stuff but I decided to wait off on it. The coupons expire on 11/2 so
&gt; try to get to your local Radioshack. I don&#x27;t know if they are giving
&gt; away the coupons everywhere, but I also got an email about the
&gt; discounts, so there is a good chance they are. Good luck.
