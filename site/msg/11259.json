I did not expect that.

I think that&#39;s part of it, and I think the rest is the operator. I&#39;m =\r\nnot saying it has to be random, cuz linear clearly works, but I think there=\r\n&#39;s conditions, or levels on the other side where the random mode is require=\r\nd. I have made progress with the audio, making it louder, but the trade off=\r\n is shorter battery life. \n \n I forget the model number, but the little RS =\r\nround AM/FM radio is hackable, and usable on external sweep. Just checked r=\r\nadioshack.com, it&#39;s the 12-820 arm band radio, it has the VT pin, and that =\r\nis an analog voltage. Thanks to Steve for that!\n \n  I re-checked the 12-470=\r\n, and it does use digital pulses on the VT pin, but it&#39;s converted to an an=\r\nalog voltage on the radio board, but---it uses 4 to 8 volts for FM, and 0 t=\r\no 8 volts for AM tuning, so I&#39;d have to do some level shifting to use AM an=\r\nd FM, as well as slowing the sweep to half speed on FM, since it&#39;s converin=\r\ng half the range--I think. I think the older 12-470 is usable as is, since =\r\nit does not have the annoying clicking. \n \n Frank-S\n_______________________=\r\n__________________________________________\nIt=92s easy to add contacts from=\r\n Facebook and other social sites through Windows Live=99 Messenger.
