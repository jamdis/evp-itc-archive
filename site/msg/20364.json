Some claim we just hear snippets of radio broadcasts along with CB radio. You can get harmonics, espcially if someone in the area is running an illegal amplifier. There can also be some mixing of signals under certain conditions, mixing combines combines signals, resulting in different frequency products. I am not saying that is what this radio jargon is, it might be an indication &quot;they&quot; are using some form of transmission, and trying to indicate it. \n\n When I do those test vidoes, the cellphone announces &quot;Look here&quot; when it starts, and the radios pick that up. I&#39;d listen for content, and personal messages, and ignore anything that seems unrelated to questions, or spirit contact. It can get really confusing. Some take every word as meanigful, even the ones that are clearly a sports annoucer, or car salesman. The Jesus broascasts that are so common in this country can add a layer of confusion.\n\n F-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Adriana Jones&quot; &lt;adrianamjones@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard 10-4 across my ghost box a couple of times. I&#39;m going to start using\n&gt; radio code to see if they respond. If anyone else wants to do this, please let\n&gt; me know what results you get.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Adriana.\n&gt;"}
