<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Richard,

I see Misty already informed you were my Youtube videos can be 
located (Thanks, Misty).  That&#x27;s where I have all my videos showing 
the different projects and research I&#x27;m involved with.  
http://www.youtube.com/ufogeek

The video I&#x27;m working on now will also be placed on my Youtube page.
I am saving those video files into HD format too (fuller screen).

I don&#x27;t sell items, or books, or movies.  I&#x27;m not into the theatrics 
of the paranormal as some are who produce those &quot;hear a sound then 
run away and scream&quot; type videos and TV shows.
I&#x27;m more into the research side, wondering what works and why.  
That&#x27;s why I come up with some crazy looking devices sometimes.  You 
never know what might just be the right combination.  You have to try 
all you can.

I like to take what is captured in the environment and let it speak 
for itself, so to speak.  The energy imprinted objects I&#x27;m 
researching now (subject of the new video) uses a capture file / 
process file system that takes environmental energy (captured with 
numerous non-microphone devices and attempts to get audio from the 
files captured using frequencies to be stimulated by the energy 
captured.
It&#x27;s a four step process that I&#x27;ll explain in detail in part 2 of the 
video.

Happy Holidays

&gt; Hi Mike, Is this going to be something you sell or something that 
can
&gt; be seen on youtube or some other place?
&gt; 
&gt; What Youtube videos of yours can i see now? 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Richard, Misty, and all other fellow researchers,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is a fasinating topic, one that I am currently most 
interested 
&gt; &gt; with as my latest experiment/research project is all about.
&gt; &gt; The crash debris that was sent to 8 researchers, I believe, does 
hold 
&gt; &gt; imprints from a violent past.
&gt; &gt; As does the area where the original crash happened, since there 
are 
&gt; &gt; still amounts of debris scattered around the immediate area, as 
well 
&gt; &gt; as beneath the surface where now stands a memorial.  Not to 
mention 
&gt; &gt; it is the last place where living humans were quickly lost.  Just 
&gt; &gt; imagine the amount of energy that must be imprinted on that exact 
&gt; &gt; spot.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That is where I hoped to gain a better understanding of that 
energy 
&gt; &gt; which is imprinted... and I must say, I think I have done just 
that.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Today I processed a number of the files I captured from the 
impact 
&gt; &gt; point using numerous devices of the non-microphone type.  After I 
put 
&gt; &gt; each of these files through a four step process (which I&#x27;ll 
explain 
&gt; &gt; in great detail in my video), I was able to listen to some 
amazing, 
&gt; &gt; and very relivent sounds.
&gt; &gt; My wife was so upset after I told her what I had heard, she 
refused 
&gt; &gt; to listen to the audio.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Let me just say... the combination I used was able to capture a 
very 
&gt; &gt; chilling scene.  One I just have to believe were the last moments 
of 
&gt; &gt; those who perished.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Once I publish the final results, I hope others will be able to 
&gt; &gt; verify what I am hearing...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m figuring to put a multi-part video on my Youtube page.  One 
part 
&gt; &gt; explaining what will be seen an heard, as well as describing the 
&gt; &gt; events of that day.  Another part with my sessions at the various 
&gt; &gt; locations, using various methods.  And a final part with the 
audio of 
&gt; &gt; the researchers who assisted with this experiment using the 
debris I 
&gt; &gt; sent each of them.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Bottom line... I really do believe that energy is imprinted in 
&gt; &gt; objects, and at locations where energy was strong at a time of 
&gt; &gt; imprint.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Happy Holidays to all.... have a safe and fun Holiday Season!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Richard,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thats a great example and a good way to look at things. the old 
&gt; &gt; idea 
&gt; &gt; &gt; that energy doesnt die its just transformed holds true with 
that 
&gt; &gt; too. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen the same thing done with missing appendages, tho a 
&gt; &gt; finger 
&gt; &gt; &gt; may have been removed it still registers under kirlian 
photography 
&gt; &gt; as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; its energy being present.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just because we dont see something or hear a thing doesnt mean 
it 
&gt; &gt; is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; nonexistant =) Perhaps it just means we are deaf and blind to 
its 
&gt; &gt; &gt; existence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for replying to my message.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Years ago I watched a slide show featuring several photo&#x27;s 
taken 
&gt; &gt; via
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kirlian photography. It seems kirlian photography captures 
certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; types of energy on film. In the demonstration a picture of a 
&gt; &gt; house 
&gt; &gt; &gt; was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shown. Later that same house had a fire and part of the house 
had 
&gt; &gt; &gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; burned to the ground but the photo taken with kirlian 
photography
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later showed that part of the house still there.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m no expert but maybe energy we can&#x27;t see leaves an imprint 
in 
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; non physical universe and can be viewed or demonstrated using 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right instruments and technique. Of course I really have no 
clue 
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; am fascinated by the evp and itc phenomena.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Enjoyed visiting your site, thanks for the link.
