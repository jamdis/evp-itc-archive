In other words, there was\nsome time slippage that resulted in an evp being made an hour before\nthe actual words were spoken by the investigator.\n\nI thing this phenomena is not the way the Box works however. \n\n-Bill\n\np.s. the famous case of thoughtography (an image appearing on film\nthat may originate in someones mind) is the subject of study of a man\nnamed Ted Serios.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Tracy &lt;loneshewolf999@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I think it&#39;s very possible.
