Tell me where=
 the seperation on the spectrum takes place between 300Hz and 300KHz. Yes, =
soundwaves cause pressure waves that our ears read as vibration and our min=

=A0
A mistake that a lot of people make is thinking that there a=
re two different types of energy at work when it comes to sound waves and e=
lectromagnetic waves. The only thing that seperates them is frequency and p=
ower. Radio waves are radio waves because they occupy a certain block of th=
e electromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same spectrum just f=
arther down with much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can penet=
rate almost anything because of their wavelengths. The shorter the waveleng=
th the more ways we can shield against them.
=A0
Think of microwaves. These=
 are also a type of radio and telemetry transmitting wave but the waves als=
o have a physical effect on our environment by causing molecules to speed u=
p, which creates heat. A little lower than this is IR or infrared it too ca=
n cause physical objects to heat up but usually it just causes molecules to=
 rotate in place. All physical things give off IR light. Its a way the tota=
l system conserves energy by spontaneously emitting IR radiation.

It was me and another girl teammate=A0present in the room. I picked up a 3r=

This instance with =
the recorders may back that theory up. That other recorder should have pick=

I am attach=

I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an u=
ntrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It w=
orks off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that dif=
fer one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them together you =
get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sen=
ding a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an u=
ntrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference=
=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This=
 was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic sig=
nals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were =
generated within a few inches of the recorder.

We are able to reproduce=
