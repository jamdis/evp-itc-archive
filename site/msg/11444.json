The files are too large to be uploaded to the forum here, but a\n&gt; short video with the audio clips has been posted on You Tube by Joey\n&gt; Tito, a Chicago researcher who filmed the investigation.  The audio\n&gt; clips are at the end, and Joey matched them to a transcript of what I\n&gt; picked up.  I sent the clips to Frank, and he picked up even more.\n&gt;\n&gt; The You Tube link is www.youtube.com/xflexx1  Joey has a short version\n&gt; and a long version; pick the short one.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a report on the investigation posted on my blog on MySpace at\n&gt; www.myspace.com/rosemaryellenguiley  and Joey&#39;s video is on my home\n&gt; page there as well.  The blog also has my report on a similar\n&gt; investigation at Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield; the clips from\n&gt; that are posted on this forum in my folder.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Rosemary\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
