All three napping around me at the moment.  \nAhhhh.... very quiet.  LOL.\n\nI&#39;ll be darned if I can find that video.  I&#39;m still combing through YouTube.  I wonder if I saw \nit somewhere else and am misremembering where.  \n\nThat&#39;s weird about the Luminator and the wall.  eeek!  Fun stuff!!\n\nOK, gonna look a little more.  \n\nMargaret\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jeremy Robert Huber&quot; &lt;JeremyRobertHuber@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Margaret,\n&gt; \n&gt; How are you today? :) And how are your babies. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; No, I haven&#39;t seen that video, although I would LOVE to see it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mark Macy was near NYC last summer in CONN. with his Luminator at a\n&gt; Spiritualist Church. I so wanted to go see him, but we had a family\n&gt; emergency and I wasn&#39;t able to attend.\n&gt; \n&gt; I read that the man that invented the Luminator had a couple going in\n&gt; a room. He sat down to meditate and when he put his head against the\n&gt; wall, his head went through the wall like it wasn&#39;t there. The\n&gt; Luminator must change the energy big time. I would be very interested\n&gt; in EVP capture when in the presence of a Luminator. Talk about Class A\n&gt;  EVP&#39;s.

Did you ever see the video on YouTube?  I&#39;m not finding\n&gt; it at the moment, but \n&gt; &gt; they video&#39;d one of the sessions.  It was quite interesting, but I\n&gt; don&#39;t remember which \n&gt; &gt; researcher (it was a man) that was conducting the session.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Margaret  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jeremy Robert Huber&quot;\n&gt; &lt;JeremyRobertHuber@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The communication was done not via radio, but telephone directly to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the researchers homes. There were numerous telephone calls made to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maggy Harsch-Fishbach, Mark Macy and even to Sarah Estep. These phone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; calls were made by members of the group on the Other Side working with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ITC researchers during the 1990&#39;s. The group working with the ITC\n&gt; &gt; &gt; researchers were guided by seven Ethereal beings on the Other Side\n&gt; &gt; &gt; called The Seven. Contact was not only made via telephone, but also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fax and files placed in Maggy Fishbach&#39;s computer. :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I highly recommend Mr. Macy&#39;s book, Miracles In The Storm. He has much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of this information on his website. http://worlditc.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many Blessings All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy Robert Huber\n&gt; &gt; &gt; New York, New York\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And were using Hacked Radios to talk to the dead!
