Those suckers have 25 pins on a side, for 100 \npins total.

In radios that use all digital tuning, the chips usually are four sided, and smaller.\n&gt;\n&gt; The solder sucker is my preferred method of component removal, some like solder wick instead. I suck out the solder, then re-heat each pin while gently wiggling the module till any remaining solder coools, leaving the pin loose, so I can gently work the module out of the main board. I save the carcas for parts, like capacitors and just incase I have to go back a re-measure a voltage. Then, my grandson takes the old stuff home for his &quot;transporter&quot; he&#39;s going to build.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S"}
