I have had very little luck with most that try to use \nthese things. They don&#39;t seem to work for everyone, although OI very \nmuch doubt that&#39;s due to some limited access, more likely it&#39;s the \nconstruction. \n\n Everything you&#39;ve seen and heard about the box is from one source, \nand I don&#39;t consider that source accurate, nor representative of what \neveryone can expect. \n\n Frank-S\n\n   --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank doesnt sell his boxes but there are plenty of alternatives \nout there. You can use manual sweep (free to try) or pick up one of \nthe radio shack radios to modify so that it does a linear scan \nemulating some of Franks boxes. Those cost about 25 bucks and quite \neasy to follow the instructions. I just posted the links to Mikes \nvideos on youtube about how to modify those. Check recent posts. For \nthose to squeamish to follow the videos instructions, there is also \nother versions that have been produced that generally do same thing \nwhich are being sold like the minibox . \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;    \n&gt;   \n&gt; djc351 &lt;djc351@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           I&#39;m interested in getting a Frank&#39;s Box for our group, \nthe Kentucky \n&gt; Shadow Chasers.
