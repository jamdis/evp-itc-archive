<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ron,

what file did you use as the sound source for EVPmaker? I hear beeps in
your recording that aren&#x27;t part of the original allophones file I made.
The recording is also very loud and sounds distorted, and you didn&#x27;t
seem to have used the internal cue list of the file (if it was the
original SJ-Allophones.wav file).

&gt; To Bruce, Stefan and others using EVPM. I have posted a file of my
&gt; test with EVPM allaphones under ronriko files. I forward this for two
&gt; reasons: the first as a request from Bruce to determine recurring
&gt; words and second because I wanted to have experienced ears hear my
&gt; recording for comments. Regarding the test, this is just 30 secs or so
&gt; of a 7 minute recording. Recorded at 90% using EVPmaker with xcross. I
&gt; was able to hear &quot;art and arthor&quot; a number of times within the 7
&gt; minutes. This is after requesting no names be spoken.
   
&gt; Regarding my experiences with evpmaker and the allaphone file sent by
&gt; Stefan, I must say my results have been underwhelming. I hear nothing
&gt; but evp gibberish. I ask that anyone with an ear for this to give a
&gt; listen and tell me if you hear anything intelligent. I am in a
&gt; terrible radio zone here in Mexico so I have high hopes on EVP maker
&gt; and the file Stefan provided. Also excited about the fact that so many
&gt; others are getting excellent communications. Thank you to anyone who
&gt; takes the time to listen to and confirm my recordings. I am beginning
&gt; to feel like I am being blocked out like William had thought. Maybe I
&gt; am in a true dead zone, no pun intended, or &quot;they&quot; don&#x27;t want me in
&gt; the loop for some reason. Ron L</pre>
