Bill,
   
  Yeah Sonia Rinaldi sent me some info including some of the pics of the Bennetts work. She told me I should join that group. O dodnt join yet but it is what made me go hmmmm maybe thats what "they" were saying with all that crystal talk before. I thought they meant use a crystal to improve my audio communication and it just wasnt making a difference. I realized perhaps I misunderstood so I got the webcam out and my first attempt was a success.
   
  But now its starting to take on its own appeal for me. I dont do it the way they did that was never my intention but It does work when I put it straight into my own setup. I loved thier results and I think perhaps if I get a higher resolution cam it will make all the difference in detail.
   
  They were mostly getting very detailed partial faces, alot of thier work reminds me of some of my own. But I see resemblances in many researchers work. It's an echo or a bridge effect. I have seen alot of "coincidences" and interaction amongst active group members. Those who stay to themselves and post nothing I cant speak for because I have no idea if they are even doing any work on this for themselves. However those who are and who are brave enough to interact with others in the field seem to be making progress.
   
   
  Theres alot of interesting stuff out there.

            Misty, The Bennetts (of The Scole Experiment) have been doing some intriguing work with crystals illuminated with light reflected off of various metals. They've posted some of the more facinating pics on the www.aaevp.com website. A few of the pics seem to have some scenery that the faces are in, check it out. I haven't quite made up my mind about this particular research just yet, but if a rapport is developed with the individuals that are coming through, perhaps some messages will follow, just like they did while the Bennetts were participating in the The Scole Experiment.
