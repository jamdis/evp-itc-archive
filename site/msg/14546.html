What I've noticed, is that some will hear,  a swear word   C...T, is what 
they thought that spirit said,  where, I heard two words, that is, "cut in" 
and it was a man's voice  telling someone to jump in at any time, I guess he 
meant into the conversation,  but someone I guess thought he was expressing 
a filthy term.  It's all in  what we perceive I guess, even though no one 
could hear my mother talk on  Steve's first show that I heard, she did verify 
herself, and yes, Pink was her  favorite color, but I also heard her voice, 
when no one else did.  Even in  real life, people will disagree on what the 
hear and see, so it will be  difficult to develop this further. Just my 
take,  sf
