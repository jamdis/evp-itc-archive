<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Caution from what?  You&#x27;ve been burned in the past by people and 
you&#x27;re taking it out on me.  My intentions are good and have nothing 
but positive things to say about this, but if you are going to 
compare me with others for making a simple observation of my own than 
so be it.  Linear works too, i just currently prefer the random 
mode...that&#x27;s all.  It hasn&#x27;t worked in 2 months and i&#x27;m excited that 
it does.  I guess i will no longer use it because you don&#x27;t like it 
anymore and since you built it i will have to do as you say.

&gt;  I would recommend extreme caution. Ego is a path to the dark side, 
and difficult to discern it is. If the RVG was that important, it 
would be illogical for them not to &quot;make it work&quot; for me, since I 
make the boxes.  I find linear much more consistent, easier to build, 
causes less noise problems, and easier to understand. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I have found &quot;the path&quot; usually leads to a bed of quicksand.

tonight&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank, i&#x27;m telling you it didn&#x27;t work at all until 
recently. They are &gt; making it work for a reason, they want me to 
bring your box and show &gt; others. Your box is the best communication 
i have right now and they &gt; told me that they want me to only be 
using your box. The answers are &gt; clear and they answer right away. 
This is my new path and they have &gt; specified i am here to teach 
others, so that&#x27;s what i will do.&gt; &gt; -Steve H.&gt; &gt; &gt;
