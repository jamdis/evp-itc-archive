<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have found it is effective to let participants hear their own
message even if it&#x27;s a group setting. I wouldn&#x27;t dream of interpreting
Box communication for other people. However, we have had sessions
where everyone quietly scribed what they heard and compared notes with
each other after closing the session. We also agreed before hand what
questions would be asked and have had sessions where no questions are
asked. -Bill

&gt; Al   I totally agree with you and Frank for that matter.  I will
repeat what I said in another message that there obviously is an
interest and need for people who wanting to learn about EVP to get
together with others who have experience in the field.  Newbies are in
fact doing just that with the folks mentioned here.  And certainly our
yahoo groups are helping to get the word out about the ease of doing
EVP research on own on.  But, you then have someone go on Coast 2
Coast and capture 1,000 names of people who are interested in
following &quot;the expert.&quot;  And, wah-la, they&#x27;re in business.   I hope
others in our groups will pursue the idea of getting together formally
and informally.  I think there is value in doing so and I think some
of the &quot;expert&quot; followers will also come over.  Not that that really
matters to me.    One last thought I have here is that I believe there
is much to be discovered by having three or more meet for the same
purpose.  I think it is more of a religious adage that says something
about &quot;when three or more meet together...&quot;   ron

&gt; They ruin this field of research. It&#x27;s too bad so many are willing
to pay and follow such egomaniacs when, as Frank S. said, anyone can
spend a few bucks at Radio Shack and record with no prior experience.  
&gt; Perhaps people should start boycotting these self proclaimed
experts. If no one shows up or gives them money, they&#x27;ll just
disappear eventually. They will eventually disappear anyway as once
people actually start researching on their own, they&#x27;ll see right
through these people. 
&gt; Anyone can record. It&#x27;s easy. No training required. As for the
boxes, Franks sent me maybe 2 emails of maybe 3 sentences of how to
fiddle with the knobs. I figured the rest out and my goodness, NO CHARGE!
