<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I dont record to my pc. I have reception problems so I have my radio 
hooked up to a set of computer speakers. I use a recorder which I set 
between the speakers I hold the radio in my hand have to move around 
to find a good spot which is something away from the speaker!!! So 
sometimes you can hear me,

Thanks for listening

&gt; I heard Mike loud and clear but can hardly hear you.  What is your 
recording setup like?
&gt;    
&gt;   For me, since I dont have a working digi recorder right now, I 
use the mic on my headphones and just set it on my desk with the 470 
facing it and i crank the mic volume almost all the way up....it took 
me a while to get it where I could hear both me and the radio when I 
played my recording back.
&gt;    
&gt;   Anyways...good job gal =)
