I heard a couple and \nthey&#39;re very interesting.\n\nI&#39;ve gotten several EVP&#39;s on my DVR that were at about twice the speed of \nnormal voice.  It fascinates me that any entity could do that.  I&#39;ve heard \nthat others have gotten slowed voices on EVP, too, but I haven&#39;t gotten \nany of those yet.\n\nZack\n\nOn Wed, 20 Jun 2007, Steve Hultay wrote:\n\n&gt; Welcome Zack, look forward to your take on the box and other ideas\n&gt; given your engineering background.  Read past posts to get an idea of\n&gt; what the group is about, i did and learned a lot of information about\n&gt; this whole topic.\n&gt;\n&gt; Listen to the Uploaded Mp3 files in the FILES section and let us know\n&gt; what you think of them.  I&#39;m in there under Simple FM Sweep radio\n&gt; design and would like to get some feedback.  I got some, but would\n&gt; like more.  My radio is a slightly different design than frank&#39;s and\n&gt; want to know what people think.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanx,\n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
