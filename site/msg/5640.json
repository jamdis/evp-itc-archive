I&#39;ll \ntry and listen to your files first.\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jules&quot; &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; For the last day or so I have been having activity at my home.  \nThis is \n&gt; really not uncommon, for it seems I have some spirits who like to \nvisit \n&gt; every now and again.  I decided to ask some questions during my \nsession \n&gt; why this spirit was here and if in fact the tec&#39;s could bring him \nhome \n&gt; or send &quot;Collectors&quot; to cross them into the light.\n&gt; \n&gt; The questions and responses are posted in the file &quot;Earth Bound \n&gt; Spirits&quot;.  Some of the the files may be long in lenght, but I \nwanted \n&gt; you to hear the conversation back and forth where several spirits \nare \n&gt; talking and responding all together.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Steve H. had a previous experience and had an opportunity to assist \nin \n&gt; crossing a so called Earth Bound Spirit over.  If in fact this is \n&gt; actually possible, this could be huge regarding our research as \nwell as \n&gt; service an additional purpose behind our gifts to communicate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Juli\n&gt;"}
