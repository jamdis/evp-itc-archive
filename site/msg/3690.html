A Open Response to Recent Discussions on The Box

By way of introduction, my name is Rick Moran and I am the 
Coordinator of the Association for the Study of Unexplained 
Phenomenon, a 35 year old research and educational organization that 
by our own corporate charter is dedicated to seeking proof of the 
survival of the human spirit after death. We are a 501 (c)(3) non-
profit corporation that is now based in Texas, and was originally 
founded in New York City. We have been involved in dozens of major 
cases, from Amityville and Mothman to our present day work on cases 
like the Skinwalker Ranch, not to mention a few hundred more that 
never got any media coverage. In the past I have counted folks like 
Scott Rogo, Peter Jordan and Paul Hoffman old friends. I continue to 
write for Fortean Times, Fate, and yes, Haunted Times on a regular 
basis. I am pleased to say that the ASUP is a very serious group with 
serious aims.

Two years ago a member of our group came to me with a report he 
prepared on ITC or more commonly known as Spirit Comm. I was 
intrigued and began to look a little deeper, which led me to the work 
of Frank Sumption and his creation, Frank&#x27;s Box.  I reached out to 
friends in our field for the purpose of securing a Box for testing 
and then I waited and waited.  Finally I found the flow chart for 
Frank&#x27;s Box on the Internet.  I have been a ham radio operator for 
longer than I have been researching the paranormal, so the layout was 
easy to interpret. Later I came into the possession of a schematic 
diagram, courtesy of Frank Sumption and became even more intrigued 
but still even more puzzled about how this device could possibly 
communicate. 

The ASUP has several divisions, all of which rely on each other to 
operate as a team.  The smallest of these groups is the Research and 
Development team, headed by an electrical engineer and fellow ham, 
Ron Ricketts, a no-nonsense kind of guy who I would categorize as a 
skeptical, show-me kind of person.  The purpose of R&amp;D is simple; 
they take common tools and make modifications to them, based on 
feedback from the field investigators.  When a device like the K-II 
is found to be too broad, or lacking a simple on-off switch, the R&amp;D 
team would modify and test the devices to make them better.  It might 
be noteworthy here to explain that all of our directors and many of 
your ranking members are all licensed amateur radio operators, so it 
can be assumed that when they ask for the R&amp;D teams help, they fully 
understand the technical aspects of what they are requesting. This 
approach has always worked well for us, be it in creating new 
lighting systems for night vision or as mentioned before the 
modification of the K-II meters.

I went to Ron to ask if we could not create a similar device to 
Frank&#x27;s Box, based on the schematics I had secured. Ron was, as 
always skeptical about the outcome, but set the team in motion to 
create a Box. The first design was noisy and lacked discrimination, 
as Ron expected, but over the next several weeks, with a lot of 
pushing and cajoling from myself, Ron worked on a succession of new 
devices, each building on the prior.  The final design was decided 
upon when Ron was sitting at a lab bench, contemplating what else he 
could conjure up, when the device, at that point a mass of wires, a 
speaker and bread-boarded components with a new battery attached 
snapped his attention with a single word, &quot;Ricketts!&quot; The word came 
across loud and clear, no noise, no static, unlike any recordings of 
other Box communications we had heard.  Ron asked the rhetorical 
question, &quot;What?&quot; and the Box repeated, &quot;Ricketts!&quot; The Box 
repeated the word one more time, when I was in the room to witness it!

We built our little box and made further enhancements, a better 
antenna, a new printed circuit board made to our specifications, 
several better, but more expensive components. The final device was 
created and was set out before a group of ASUP members.  Both Ron and 
I gave the Box to our Director of Research with some very short 
instruction on how to tune it and then moved to a neutral corner, 
about 20 feet away.  The remaining members of the team circled the 
Box and began to ask questions. One member asked, &quot;Who built you?&quot; 
and the Box responded &quot;Ron Rick.&quot;  The member attempted to correct 
the Box, &quot;You mean Ron Ricketts?&quot; to which the Box 
answered, &quot;NO!&quot; in a loud, clear tone.  The group worked with the 
Box for about 40 minutes. Some questions were clearly answered, 
others totally ignored. Then the Box said loudly, &quot;Go Home!&quot;  When 
another member began to formulate another question, the Box said 
again, more loudly, &quot;GO HOME!&quot; Followed by &quot;Get Rick&quot;  I walked 
over to the group and the box again said, &quot;Go Home!&quot; and so I ended 
the session.

Similar results were found when the Box was sent to the Stanley Hotel 
that weekend, where Frank Sumption finally got to see and work with 
the Box and gave it a rave review.  Frank had been in contact with 
both myself and Ron Ricketts and had helped us along, but he was 
amazed at what parts we had eliminated and what circuitry we had 
added. He told those in the room, &quot;This device works better than any 
Box I have ever built.&quot;  He also admitted that he had hopes that the 
pressure would now be removed from himself. 

This of course, brings us up to the point at hand.  How does the 
device work.  Well it simply scans the AM broadcast band, cutting 
little slivers from all the broadcast signals. You can change the 
tone, the cycle rate, and volume as you wish, you can use a speaker 
(the larger the better we find) or a headphone, hook up a mic so that 
you can record your questions as well as the answers and of course 
plug in a recorder. The unit uses a rechargeable power source, which 
you can plug in to recharge and will last about 40 hours on a charge. 
It is totally portable.

The larger question is WHY it works, and I do not have an answer for 
you on that.  The Box does communicate, it answers some questions and 
seems to project an intelligence. The answers are rational, but I 
have no idea how they are being generated or by whom. Remember, the 
reason that the ASUP built this device was for research to answer 
just those questions and an in depth study will begin in January with 
the help of a university grant. No one in the ASUP is making any 
claims of the paranormal at this point.  Remember, when Marconi first 
sent radio signals from one side of the Atlantic to the other, there 
were those who pronounced his accomplishment as magic and obviously 
that was not the case. Our hope is that other serious researchers 
will join in this study and gain some insight to how it works, but I 
will go on record to say that those who can successfully operate the 
device are certainly not limited to a select few nor are they someone 
blessed, anymore than when a person turns on the TV set.

I have read dozens of pop-theories about what is being heard from the 
Box and I have a long list of things that it is not.  It is not 
interference from ham radio, CB or FRMS radio signals, we have 
checked diligently for that, it is not simply noise or static, there 
is none from our box. It could be matrixing, but some of what I have 
personally heard seems to rule this out, although we will be doing 
more testing in that area shortly. I simply can&#x27;t offer a good 
explanation for what is being reported from the Box at this time.

There was of course one other problem.  How do we get these devices 
into the hands of those who want to study them?  A non-profit 
corporation can&#x27;t go into the business of marketing, so the ASUP 
gave Ron Ricketts the full rights to the device and he in turn gave 
it to an electronics producer for mass production.  This is not a 
cheap device to build, there are no Radio Shack parts inside, we 
demanded only top components and our design has been strictly adhered 
to in every way; the circuit board is our own design.  The device is 
now available through www.paranormalsystems.com and you have my word 
it is being sold at as close to cost as it can possibly be.  If in 
the future we find a less expensive way to do it, we will, but for 
now the device is at least available to everyone, without the need to 
gain Thomas Edison&#x27;s permission, or pay an hourly fee.  What the 
device says is now open to your own interpretation.

The Mini-Box, as it is now called, is now available and those who are 
interested can go to the paranormal systems site to hear some audio 
clips, see the device itself and if they want one, can order it. This 
is not a fund raiser for ASUP. We are not getting anything out of 
this, except for the Boxes we need to do the research. We have always 
attempted to support our fellow researchers and will continue to do 
so. We have also spent a lot of time trying to debunk the snake oil 
salesmen of our field and will continue to pursue them as well.  I 
hope this answers some of the questions you have and hopefully clears 
the air of the smoke and mirrors that seem to be popping up since we 
announced our device. If you have any questions, I&#x27;d love to have 
the opportunity to try and answer them.
