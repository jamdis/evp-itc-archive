I aslo see them in other media as well, smoke, fire,\nsteam, clouds, and I do not accept the suggestion that it is stupid brain\ntricks.  I used to record endless hours of dark video while recording school\nboard meetings, the digital recorder used a hard drive to store the video\nwiht a seperate sound track, no video=no sound. We were just after the\nsound When I viewed the black video, it would appear to be kind of an alien\nlanguage, symbols and/or letters.

It was really compelling to see letters and numbers, not images or\n&gt; pictures, but partial words appear in the graph. At first it was I thought\n&gt; it was a software glitch but it is a repeatable event. It was on LiveSciFi\n&gt; which is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was some kind of code error\n&gt; but it happened on more than one webcast.\n&gt;\n&gt; So if anyone has Audition, just feed Box output right in your computer and\n&gt; see what happens. I wanted to try it tonight but I have Audacity and the\n&gt; spectragraph feature doesn&#39;t have that shaded appearance that Audition does\n&gt; so it&#39;s not able to render images or characters, at least as far as I see\n&gt; using the various settings.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Tim Woolworth\n&gt; &lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have tried numerous EVP files and short box clips and so far\n&gt; &gt; nothing discernible has appeared on either program.
