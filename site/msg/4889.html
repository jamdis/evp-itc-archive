Deb,
   
            When I first started the research with the 12-469 I hated it!  I could not get past the ticking, it was driving me crazy and only would listen to the FM (which does not tick).   I focused on just listening for the words and voices that came through.  There is so many channels to scan on the FM and is so busy it's hard to pick out radio vs spirit communication.  Your ear will come to tune and decipher which is which.  After working with it on a daily bases, I switched to the AM and being able to recognize the difference, you can learn to tune out the ticking.  I know its hard, but if your determine after a while you do not even know its there anymore.  The communication will just flow.

Deb,

The new model 469's have the inherent clicking after using it for a 
while you will learn to ignore it. Juli Velazquez has both 469 and 
old model 470 and she prefers the 469 and gets very good results with 
it.

My suggestion is make your local radio shack manager aware that you 
are searching for these particular radios and can he please try to 
locate one for you. I'm sure that there is one or two sitting on a 
shelf in some radio shack somewhere.

If you can get an older model 469 that does not have the clicking, It 
looks exactly like the older model 470 and comes in the cardboard box 
nox the plastic see through rapper.

hang in there something will turn up. And if not don't let that 
discourage you from your research just do your best and what you have 
will work for you.
