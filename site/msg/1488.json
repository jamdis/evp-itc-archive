Seems \nto work well for me.  Maybe cheap and simple is the answer.  The \nanswers and sentences they form come with time using the box and not \nhow fantastic the sweep is.  They can use anything, but i&#39;m trying \nrandom tuning next to compare to my linear.  There is a picture of \nmy box in the Photos section here.  Nothing fancy, as a matter of \nfact, it&#39;s pretty flimsy but works and that&#39;s important.  Cost was \nunder $100 with radio shack parts, you just need someone to build it \nthat knows what they are doing.\n\n-Steve\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks. It&#39;s not so much evolution, it&#39;s using what I have, like \nthe scrap \n&gt; piece of aluminum for the panel. The next &quot;evolution&quot; will be the \nprinted \n&gt; circuit board. Of course I keep adding functions, which means more \nboard \n&gt; real estate, which raises costs. I really want the linear sweep, \nand tone \n&gt; injection to be standard functions. It would be interesting to use \nall \n&gt; stereo speakers, and mics in the echo boxes, but that almost \ndoubles the \n&gt; components again. I&#39;ve thought about a stripped down version, like \njust the \n&gt; tuner and sweep generator, then use something like a boom box for \nthe all \n&gt; the audio and recording functions. If it was only linear sweep, \nthe system \n&gt; could be made on a small board===cheap.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Another &quot;boring&quot; weekend.\n&gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 09 Jul 2007 16:16:23 -0000\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The evolution continues.... nice cabinet face design Frank. -Bill\n&gt; &gt;--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The boards aren&#39;t wired in yet, but it&#39;s getting there!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n_________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://newlivehotmail.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; http://im.live.com/messenger/im/home/?source=hmtextlinkjuly07\n&gt;"}
