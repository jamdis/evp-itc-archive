Thanks Suzanne...

Interesting your comment about the sentences, and you=
 are correct they do occur.
=A0
With my process each question is one .wav f=
ile, but I am finding that I still at times need to break up a .wav file in=
to three or more files, just so I can hear the messages more clearly. it ap=
pears at times the messages are compressed as in a zip file into one .wav f=
ile.

I am very happy that you are using EVP to help find the missing.

Each of us in this field of study have two barriers that hinder the suc=

1. getting law enforcement to listen to us and take us se=
riously
2. keeping other spirits in our recording space quiet whil we talk =
to our victim. When they have side conversations, their messages get picked=
 up thus corrupting the data.
=A0
For number 1, I think we and perhaps even=
 some mediums having the same issue, keep trying to get law enforcement to =
look at our leads, but I think we need to think backwards. Meaning, lets ge=
t law enforcement to start using the device themselves, and once they see t=

tting us help them.

For those of us, like you, me and others that volun=

Hi everyone, I have recorded a video of my EV=
P-Radio Crime recording 
process, where I get leads from deceased victims a=
nd hand over to law 
enforcement or missing person advocates to run the lea=
ds.

http://uk.youtube. com/watch? v=3DWhGKXBp6Lg0

I went out to Mike Coll=
etta's site to see if there was any guidance, 
but none on how to sync up m=
y voice in the video.

I used a web cam to do the recording.

Does anyone k=
now how to do this?

Mike Edwards
