Thanks for the confirmation Bruce.  This is actually the first EVP message that I received and that I actually heard the message.   One word.  It's a start.  The other messages you and others helped me with don't count for me because I don't hear anything...yet.  I still will work with those recordings to process slower...when I can figure out how to do that.
   
  Regarding HELEN being without the RS box sweep.  I discovered the next day that I had the volume turned way down, so the sweep was happening but the segment with HELEN the sweep clicks cannot be heard.   Don't know what a Class A EVP is but it is better than a NO CLASS.  Right?     Did you have a chance to confirm my other one word message which I think was my wife's name DINO for Dinorah.  Possibly someone wants to talk with her, which would make sense over here in her hometown in Campeche, Mexico.  Quite a few relatives passed over...they have lived in the area for 200 years or so.  Second thought, it's a guys voice and I probably don't want to start a triangle thing.  Thanks again   Ron L

          Ron,
 
That file most definately says "Helen"
 
from what I can hear of the RS box running, 
you are recieving no signal or radio sweep at all.
 
If the RS box where working correctly you would hear it scanning through radio channels
and therefore hear all bits of radio transmission, 
what I believe you have captured is a traditional unfortunately but not unfortunate.
class A evp and not a box message.
 
That in of itself is like finding a needle in a hay stack.
 
if you have any questions, let me know.
 
Bruce

Subject: [EVP-ITC] rs 469 post

        I am posting two short sessions for hopefully others to comment on.  This is completed with a RS 469 going directly into my handheld digital recorder.  Coincidentally, I am outside in a light rain so maybe it is ideal for me here in Mexico where I get few signals.
  At first I thought I heard the word BUENO (hello in Spanish) but I now hear DINO with is my wife's name...short for Dinorah.  She is normally not with me for sessions and was not with me for this session so I doubt what I am hearing.  Any comments would be appreciated.  
  The other recording I hear the name HELEN.  I don't know anyone with that name.  Ron L
