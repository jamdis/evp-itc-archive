<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Kinda. I had a video box years ago, it was a VCR tuner that I swept just like I do with the radio in a box, got some intersting images, too bad don&#x27;t work anymore because of the change in TV formats recently.

&gt; does any one know if this is possible or has tried it: visual equivalent of the ghost box, like  a bunch of movie frames and scramble them and scroll through them quickly, could that produce anything?????  Is that something that could be accomplished with video editing software?  is that what evpmaker is?  pre-fed raw audio (rather than live transmitted audio like the ghost box) ?
&gt; 
&gt; I dunno, maybe sounds farfetched, but thought I&#x27;d ask... was thinking about it last night....
