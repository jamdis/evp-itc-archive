 Is there anybody out there?

Hiya Jill. yep everyone had a busy weeke=
nd. Many out of town at the various events or dealing with family and work.=
 Some are recovering from having too much fun.

A tech in reference to evp =
usually represents what some others call a guide. A helper of sorts whether=
 its just to get information or to help resolve an issue. They often appear=
 over and over and act as a "lead" for the group of speakers.

As for how l=
ong you record personally I have to say short is better. I find that spirit=
s speak in bursts of energy and if I record for long periods of time I get =
very little but if I record for a short period of time they make much bette=
r use of that time. Also it is much easier to analyze short recordings in d=
epth.

The only time Ive recorded long sessions is if I am in a group or ci=
rcle and want to record whats being said by us as well as spirit. Being out=
 on investigations one might choose to record there longer as you document =
your investigation but for straight evp work i usually do between 30 second=
s and 3 minutes and no longer. They use the time wisely. And the voices are=
 much louder. When doing the group or circle such as with a medium they als=
o have been loud as we were but again its much more energy in the room when=
 doing those things.

Again its just my viewpoint and others may think diff=
erently or have different experiences. Hope that helps!
