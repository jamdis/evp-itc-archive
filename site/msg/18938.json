I don&#39;t how it works, but it stops them cold. They don&#39;t come\n&gt; &gt; back and keep harassing. I tolerate some cussing an name calling, I can out\n&gt; &gt; cuss any of them!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  They probably find other ways to pull tricks, which is why I don&#39;t any\n&gt; &gt; information as gospel from the boxes, and I laugh at the experts that think\n&gt; &gt; they have it all figured out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  There&#39;s a thing from India--I think--the spirits throw pebbles at people\n&gt; &gt; walking along  the paths at night to put a little fear in the people. With\n&gt; &gt; boxes, they also throw pebbles--and &quot;they&quot; tell me they throw pebbles. It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; like a game or something.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  F-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   On Fri, Oct 8, 2010 at 3:28 PM, Adriana Jones &lt;adrianamjones@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks guys for the advice, I was a little bit distressed at first upon\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hearing those things, but I feel a little bit better now... and armed with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; advice on how to handle it next time... I also found someone say the f-word\n&gt; &gt;&gt; now too, but I&#39;ll know how to handle it better now. Should I post the vulgar\n&gt; &gt;&gt; files up on here, as proof, or should I leave them off this group, for being\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vulgar? Frank? Anyone? Please let me know.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Adriana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jones&quot; &lt;adrianamjones@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I know that there are many spirits who are vulgar, malicious, liars,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; troublemakers, etc. Last night I did my first ghost box session alone, (my\n&gt; &gt;&gt; second session overall - or third if I count the synth voice box session).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; During the session, I was feeling a little bit self-conscious and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; discouraged, not sure if it would work for me alone, etc. so my mood was a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; little down, maybe negative.... also I&#39;m a relatively young female (28). I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wondering if its due to those two factors that I received - upon going back\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to listen to the recorded session (I&#39;ll try to post files up later for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; confirmation)... a series of unwelcoming and vulgar messages... toward the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; beginning of the session someone said &quot;you&#39;re too young&quot; and then a while\n&gt; &gt;&gt; into it I got &quot;h* cheats, hit me hit me hit me hit me&quot;... and then toward\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the end of the session I got &quot;a**hole&quot;. (Frank, please let me know if I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt;&gt; crossed the line as far as posting up vulgar words on this group - not sure\n&gt; &gt;&gt; how else to discuss my session, lol... and I do apologize)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So here&#39;s the thing, I can alter my attitude, to be more positive, but I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; can&#39;t alter my age and gender... so any other females get vulgar messages\n&gt; &gt;&gt; like this? And what can I do about it? What should I say? I really have no\n&gt; &gt;&gt; desire to continue with these sessions if this is how I get treated... I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; guess I was an easy target, just starting out with the ghost box, and not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; being a confident type, I&#39;m a shy, timid, walk-all-over-me type too\n&gt; &gt;&gt; often.... how do I &quot;administer discipline&quot; in this situation? Does it work\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to just tell them to please stop it, or that you&#39;re not welcome if you don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;&gt; behave, etc? Or does that only egg them on further? Help!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
