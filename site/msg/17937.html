<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, it&#x27;s that stuff that proves EVP, except to the skeptic, they accept
no evidence whatsoever. No matter what is present it&#x27;s ignored. Recall
Lizzie Boring, who just attacked,
attacked, attacked and would not even acknowledge anyone&#x27;s claims.

 I think maybe ignore the skeptics, their comments and negative attitude is
irrelavant.

&gt; Hi Frank, so you remember back last year in spring of 2009 when that
&gt; Chinese student, Annie Le  who was going to be married within the following
&gt;  week was murdered?  I was really new to this but, from the first day she
&gt; came up missing, and the police thought she would be found ok, I did a
&gt; session on that first day, and I posted what I got on a couple of lists.  I
&gt; still have those files, and date on them on the pc here, I played them to
&gt; police over the phone, and they took the report, in the end every thing
&gt; spirit said was true.  Everything, right down to the place they found her
&gt; body, I think Bruce might recall this, it was his list I think where they
&gt; were posted, everyone was hoping she&#x27;d be ok, but as it turns out she was
&gt; killed, spirit said, &quot;code blue&quot;, gave his occupation, &quot;the tech&quot; and his
&gt; full name &quot;Raymond Clark&quot; and hers &quot;Annie Le&quot; they said &quot;he buried her body
&gt; in the wall&quot; and that her body would be found.  The girl herself even came
&gt; through crying, and had an older Chinese woman (the accent) I can locate
&gt; these files, if you like I will post them again.  I know this stuff is true,
&gt; I let the police hear the files over the phone when they were taking
&gt; reports, the files were clear enough, that the guy heard them, he thought it
&gt; was people in a bar talking about the what happened, sf

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t waste anyone&#x27;s time  by posting a bunch of radio snippets that
&gt;&gt; &quot;Sound like something&quot;.  I would post one if it ever actually seemed proof
&gt;&gt; of intelligent communication to me: for example, a bunch of consistent
&gt;&gt; predictions, posted before the event, read by all, then confirmed
&gt;&gt; afterwards.  That would be the only worthwhile thing to post that I can
&gt;&gt; think of.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Since I have never gotten anything like that, I have not posted it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And I notice neither have you.

&gt;&gt; &quot;I think your instinct to stop posting this stuff might have been a good
&gt;&gt; one. I suspect you are feeling a bit overwhelmed with this field right now,
&gt;&gt; and it may be something is nagging at you inside someplace, saying it is a
&gt;&gt; waste of your time or a burden on your life and health, or that you just
&gt;&gt; need a little more space for a while.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  It&#x27;s a knowing we all have, that there&#x27;s something to this, that it&#x27;s
&gt;&gt; amazing, yet remains unprovable to others.

&gt;&gt;&gt; *Actually, it&#x27;s more interesting than that.  Not only do you not control
&gt;&gt;&gt; what the &#x27;spirits&#x27; say, you also don&#x27;t control what broadcast radio says,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and to a large extent you don&#x27;t control what your brain finds and interprets
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the noise you are hearing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I listened to these (trying not to look at the labels, since once a
&gt;&gt;&gt; person looks at the labels, they prime their brains to interpret the sounds
&gt;&gt;&gt; in YOUR way, not their own way).  To me, they were either just a mess of
&gt;&gt;&gt; random radio snippets, exactly what you&#x27;d expect if a 3 year old were
&gt;&gt;&gt; randomly twisting the radio dial, or they were just noise.  Nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt; paranormal in the least.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; In any case, I&#x27;d recommend a break: take a nice month off.  See how you
&gt;&gt;&gt; feel being away from all this for a while.  Come back fresh if you feel ok
&gt;&gt;&gt; after that.  But if you feel obsessed when away, it might be good to ask
&gt;&gt;&gt; your friends and loved ones for some opinions on what they see in you.  Your
&gt;&gt;&gt; health is more important than anything here anyways, and you can&#x27;t really do
&gt;&gt;&gt; a job with interpretation of your results, much less your other
&gt;&gt;&gt; responsibilities in life, unless you put your health first.

&gt;&gt;&gt; *Well, got no response out of the other list, let&#x27;s see if any of you
&gt;&gt;&gt; folks on these lists can hear these at all. They may be too fast, but I did
&gt;&gt;&gt; try to slow them a bit,  I know, these are very hard to hear, got them last
&gt;&gt;&gt; night in response to Steve&#x27;s letter about all the &quot;religious&quot;  crap I&#x27;ve
&gt;&gt;&gt; been sending,  such weird files I sometimes send in lately.  I do not
&gt;&gt;&gt; control what spirits say though, after all they are just people too.  Got
&gt;&gt;&gt; one on here that&#x27;s really funny, I think it has a little demon on it too, he
&gt;&gt;&gt; seems very angry, and wants someone to &quot;Let me out!  Let me out!&quot; is what he
&gt;&gt;&gt; is saying, I think he is wanting to come after some folks, because, even
&gt;&gt;&gt; demon&#x27;s believe in God.  He really sounds mad at some people and wants
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;.....out,&quot; just going to let you hear it, may need to play it several times
&gt;&gt;&gt; to hear, but I think its kinda cute. I told them what some on the lists
&gt;&gt;&gt; were saying, and this was the response.  btw  Is someone going to Florida ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; The last one says something about FL Hope you all enjoy them. sf*
