I could not get past the ticking, it was driving me crazy and only would listen to the FM (which does not tick).   I focused on just listening for the words and voices that came through.  There is so many channels to scan on the FM and is so busy it&#39;s hard to pick out radio vs spirit communication.  Your ear will come to tune and decipher which is which.  After working with it on a daily bases, I switched to the AM and being able to recognize the difference, you can learn to tune out the ticking.  I know its hard, but if your determine after a while you do not even know its there anymore.  The communication will just flow.  \n   \n  Juli\n\nbhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n          \nDeb,\n\nThe new model 469&#39;s have the inherent clicking after using it for a \nwhile you will learn to ignore it.
