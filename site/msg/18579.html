s bark for sure.  I'd know that bark anywhere.  Sorry, that I can=
't make it any clearer, I need to get one of those better ghost boxes I gue=
ss.  RJ, spirits are just like us, they are not omnipresent like =
God,  probably why David doesn't want to play the guessing game, =
he has better things to do over there, and has said, they have thousands of=
 people standing in this long line waiting to get into the Heavens, and He =
can't just drop His job and go to your house to see what you have over ther=
e, He did tell me that first time what it was, and i sent it to you, but it=
 was too late.  It's hard for me to understand them sometimes, He was =
also right about that little boy, Syler being
 killed, and where his body w=
ould be found, I don't know what they did about it though. sf</DIV></FONT>
