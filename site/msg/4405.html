<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ursula,

There is a certain urgency to Box messages - sort of like they need 
to convey quickly. The same thing happens in video ITC, it&#x27;s like 
there is but a moment and we all better pay attention. -Bill

&gt; Willy, Really interested in listening to the new files.  I&#x27;ll let 
you know after.
&gt;   Just to throw in regarding EVP maker and everything else but the 
boxes.  I used EVP maker and the water method AND foreign language 
broadcast method and radio static and box fan, etc etc etc before I 
got my shack hack and my Joe&#x27;s box, and I must admit that I have put 
everything else aside even though I got good results with ALL of 
those other methods.  There&#x27;s just something very exciting about the 
boxes, I think, that makes us forsake all others.  When I started 
using a hack, which Jeff Rezman made for me before I got the Joe&#x27;s 
Box, I felt it was a nervous sort of experimentation--that is to say, 
the loud, short, fast sound clips had me on edge, as I was used to 
quiet static and water, but I think now I&#x27;m addicted to the sound and 
the frenzy of it!  Does anyone else feel this way?

&gt;           Ursula and Misty  thank you very much for your feedback. 
I 
&gt; really appreciate you taking the time to listen, and for the 
&gt; comments, especially noting the dual layers of speech. Interesting. 
&gt; Frank S. - Thanks for the recent files from EVPmaker - nice! 
&gt; There hasn&#x27;t been much discussion regarding EVPmaker lately, so I 
&gt; wasn&#x27;t&#x27; sure if it was a viable tool to use. I haven&#x27;t read many 
&gt; older posts, but hope to get caught up during the holidays. Have 
you 
&gt; or others considered modifying speech synthesis software to 
generate 
&gt; random sounds? I wonder how something like that would work
&gt; On the 16th I did three 3minute recordings and got 9 clips from 
&gt; them. In this session, I was asking questions regarding a knocking 
&gt; sound I heard while going to sleep or waking up about 12 years ago. 
&gt; My life situation wasn&#x27;t the best at that time. It was always three 
&gt; knocks, and once a doorbell, but not the doorbell for where I was 
&gt; then living. Started the Knocking session by telling &quot;Rick&quot; that I 
&gt; got messages from previous session, got &quot;Well, he&#x27;s got patience!&quot; 
&gt; for response. Then was told, &quot;Aye, it smells in here.&quot; Next asked 
&gt; them what sound did I hear back then, and got &quot;it was knocking 
(maybe 
&gt; nothing?)&quot; The best one so far is; &quot;Our earthbound forefathers are 
&gt; video programs.&quot; A second voice keeps repeating &quot;Ent&quot; syllable 
&gt; during this one. I have put these files in a new folder called 
&gt; Knocking, which is under Laptop MP3s. More comments there. 
&gt; I&#x27;m making progress on getting the software needed to do 
&gt; linear scanning with the Radio Shark 2 USB am/fm radio and hope to 
&gt; have it up and running within the next week or two. 
&gt; Thanks again to all
&gt; Willy
