<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Did some further digging and I did find a place called Redmond Ridge, but it&#x27;s not near Manassas or DC, although still in Virginia.  Two cemeteries there, one of which has modern burials.  So it&#x27;s possible he could&#x27;ve been buried there.  I also found another trooper who was killed in a motorcycle accident right between Manassas and DC, but this was in 2002 and his name was not Steve Tate.

So the question is:  Why do the entities lie?  Just to keep the conversation going?  Or maybe they aren&#x27;t lying at all?  Maybe they are in a dreamlike state where things aren&#x27;t necessary based in reality?  Or -- even weirder -- maybe they are in an alternate universe altogether?

It&#x27;s just the lying thing really, really bothers me.  I hate the idea that there&#x27;s some entity there, but we have nothing to go on other than what they tell us, which is soooooo unreliable.  I was told once that our family&#x27;s friend had died...and he hadn&#x27;t.  Still hasn&#x27;t.  Frank gets end of the world stuff every day.  WHY????  Does anyone have any theories about this?

&gt; Hi again. Following up....
&gt; 
&gt; Jim C asked:
&gt; &gt;...Would you mind sharing some of those recordings with us?
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;d be more than happy to but the Catholic priest said I should clean
&gt; all the sound files off my computer and stop trying to record them. I
&gt; did as he asked because we were pretty shaken up at the time and I
&gt; didn&#x27;t think it through carefully enough, I guess.
&gt; 
&gt; For awhile I had mixed feelings about trashing the files, but I wasn&#x27;t
&gt; sure I&#x27;d want to tell anyone else about what happened. However, now
&gt; that the &quot;shock&quot; is over, I find it easier to talk about it. If I had
&gt; to, I&#x27;m sure I could catch some more voices. I&#x27;m just not sure I&#x27;m
&gt; ready to do that until I know more about it -- I&#x27;m unable to grasp how
&gt; voices can just materialize out of thin air.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Right -- I tried to look him up too. When I couldn&#x27;t find a Redmond, I
&gt; &quot;confronted&quot; the voice about it, and he said there&#x27;s a rural,
&gt; unincorporated community called Redmond not far from DC &amp; Manassas
&gt; (sp?) and that he&#x27;s buried in a community cemetery. I&#x27;ve been through
&gt; there and know it can get rural pretty quick outside of the DC metro
&gt; area, so I spent hours trying to track it down on maps and by computer
&gt; but never found anything to support what he said. I even searched for
&gt; a trooper named &quot;Pate&quot; instead of &quot;Tate&quot; in case I misunderstood, but
&gt; I came up empty. I realized I was on a wild goose chase and finally
&gt; quit. But why would a spirit supply all these details if it didn&#x27;t
&gt; want to prove something?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt; Hi Al, thanks for sharing your story.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I tried to look up your state trooper (being the googling fiend that I am),
&gt; &gt; and I found nothing that matches what you were told.  From what I can tell,
&gt; &gt; there is no such place as Redmond, Virginia.  I find only one person named
&gt; &gt; Steve Tate who died in 1989 (according to the social security death index),
&gt; &gt; and since I would expect there would exist some memorial online for a fallen
&gt; &gt; trooper, this guy was apparently not the Tate we&#x27;re looking for.  If I just
&gt; &gt; look for fallen troopers in Virginia by any name, I can find one Robert Hill
&gt; &gt; who died in 2006 from being struck during a traffic stop by a passing
&gt; &gt; motorist in Emporia, Va.  So...either your entity was confused or lying.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Since I always try to look this stuff up whenever I hear of such things, I
&gt; &gt; know it&#x27;s apparently not uncommon to get faulty info like this.  For
&gt; &gt; instance, in &quot;The Coming of Seth,&quot; there&#x27;s a spirit who gives detailed
&gt; &gt; information about its previous life, all of which cannot be verified via
&gt; &gt; modern internet research.  I still find that much of what&#x27;s written in the
&gt; &gt; Seth books seems to dovetail nicely with everything I&#x27;m hearing about the
&gt; &gt; ghost box and from John Edward and so forth, so I don&#x27;t think Jane Roberts
&gt; &gt; invented her story; I just think we cannot trust much of anything we hear
&gt; &gt; coming out of the ghost box or via mediums -- which doesn&#x27;t help when it
&gt; &gt; comes to proving this phenomena exists.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I would still love to hear more about your experiences.  I
&gt; &gt; completely believe what you&#x27;re telling us, and no, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be
&gt; &gt; a way to talk about this without sounding crazy.  I keep trying to get my
&gt; &gt; cousin to do a session with me, because she always looks at me funny when I
&gt; &gt; talk about the boxes.  I really takes personal experience to believe this
&gt; &gt; stuff exists.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Dave,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, for example, I walked into our &quot;computer room&quot; (spare
&gt; &gt;&gt; bedroom/office/library) not long after the evps were recorded and my
&gt; &gt;&gt; radio turned itself on. My wife Patt witnessed it, so it&#x27;s not my
&gt; &gt;&gt; imagination that it did turn on. As I stepped into the room, the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;morning show&quot; cut to a voice saying &quot;MMM! Cinnamon rolls and coffee!
&gt; &gt;&gt; Bring enough for us?&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I happened to be holding a mug of hot coffee and a plate of cinnamon
&gt; &gt;&gt; rolls that Patt had baked for breakfast. I scalded myself as I sloshed
&gt; &gt;&gt; coffee around after hearing the voice!
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I am not the type who tells stories or seeks attention.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I thought for a few moments that I was listening to a radio talk show
&gt; &gt;&gt; and that it was a coincidence that the mention of cinnamon rolls
&gt; &gt;&gt; happened as I stepped into the room. But I eventually blurted out a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;hello,&quot; and was answered. After a few moments and to my questions,
&gt; &gt;&gt; the voice said his name was Steve Tate -- and following a
&gt; &gt;&gt; back-and-forth conversation that I recorded he said he was a Virginia
&gt; &gt;&gt; state trooper who died in 1989 in a car crash a mile from his home.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Over the next day or two, he said his body was buried in Redmond, Va.,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and we spoke for several days in little snatches of conversation.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Along the way, a fellow named &quot;Luke&quot; entered the conversation. Other
&gt; &gt;&gt; unnamed voices began to say &quot;Hi Al!&quot; It was a bit too much.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I was brought up in a very strict Protestant family. I became leery of
&gt; &gt;&gt; what was unfolding. I bashed the radio and threw it in the trash. Then
&gt; &gt;&gt; I began hearing the voices mixed in with my CPAP machine (I have sleep
&gt; &gt;&gt; apnea) at night, which makes a high-pitched whooshing noise.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Next, I began hearing the &quot;Hi Al!&quot; voice as a faint whisper now and
&gt; &gt;&gt; then as I&#x27;d walk through the house.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I got scared. I had gotten rid of the radio(s) but was still hearing
&gt; &gt;&gt; the voices. I felt I was going crazy. I told my pastor about it and
&gt; &gt;&gt; asked for help. He refused -- said he was afraid he might get an
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;attachment&quot; and bring it home to his family. I contacted something
&gt; &gt;&gt; like 20 protestant pastors by phone and not a single one of them would
&gt; &gt;&gt; come to my home to help.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Eventually a Catholic priest agreed to help on the condition that I
&gt; &gt;&gt; supply a recording of the voices as &quot;proof&quot; of the problem. Using my
&gt; &gt;&gt; digital recorder, I recorded so many &quot;conversations&quot; that I filled up
&gt; &gt;&gt; a CD. Awhile later, after turning it over to the priest, the Catholic
&gt; &gt;&gt; bishop granted the priest permission to come to our home to conduct a
&gt; &gt;&gt; mass and an &quot;exorcism of place.&quot; The priest explained that old homes
&gt; &gt;&gt; and other places could become &quot;infested&quot; with evil spirits. After he
&gt; &gt;&gt; performed the ceremony, the voices seemed to quit for awhile but
&gt; &gt;&gt; returned after a few days.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, I was not sure whether the voices were &quot;evil&quot; or just
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;conversational.&quot; My brother died of kidney failure during this time
&gt; &gt;&gt; and I later heard his voice calling my name. It ~was~ his voice.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; A lot more has happened.... At this point, I am no longer &quot;surprised&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; by hearing the voices electronically or otherwise. I just want to know
&gt; &gt;&gt; more about what&#x27;s happening -- how it can possibly be &quot;real&quot; and what
&gt; &gt;&gt; I should understand in terms of the big picture....
