<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>April,

I wrote back to Rosemary about a few more things concerning the Radio 
Shack hacks, and here is what she wrote back...

&quot;It&#x27;s certainly an affordable alternative! I think it works pretty 
well. But I LOVE the Mini-Box!&quot;

Just thought I&#x27;d share.

&gt; I am very excited for this! I think it will be a good, informative
&gt; show. I was able to deliver the very first of the production
&gt; mini-boxes to Rosemary this past Sunday while on the Queen Mary. 
&gt; 
&gt; We spent time with all the different devices. The RadioShack Hack was
&gt; very surprising!! 
&gt; 
&gt; All of this technology is fantastic. So glad to see so many minds
&gt; working out there to combine and create ideas.
&gt; 
&gt; Have a great show Rosemary!!! :)
