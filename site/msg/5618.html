Listened to all your files Bruce.  To tell the truth it is like eavesdropping on a telephone conversation.  Don't have to guess too much about what is being said by either party.  Pretty unbelievable really.  But I do believe.  Hope someday I can get even one word from the other party.  
   
  So, who was bored and did you do anything to amuse them?  Ron L
