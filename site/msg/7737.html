Or if it was about the humming, I am running the humming through 
EVPMaker and some other electronic devices.  I'm definitely aware of the 
need for the electronic energy for them to play off of as well.  =)

Although I will follow up on your suggestion about learning some basic 
electronics, too.  I want to get my head wrapped around all this as much 
as possible.  Thanks for the tip about square waves.
