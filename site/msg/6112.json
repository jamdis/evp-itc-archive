Our group would be interested in seeing if we can \nhelp them. Also with any help from people in this group. Just wanted \nto see what you think about it. Our group pays strict attention to all\nprivacy. I have learned alot from a Podcast on Ghost to Ghost PM with \nMike Coletta and his guest Bruce Halliday about the Ghost Box and \nopening a portal with the thing that I emailed about. The shadowy \nfigure that followed me home that I think came through the Box. Oh \nwell Ann have a great day and everyone on here too.\n\nRegards,\n\nRalph Smith\nSpirit Paranormal Investigation Team of Central PA"}
