<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>One of the skepdorks wanted to put one of my boxes ina faraday cage for
testing. My response was Well Dah, of course it won&#x27;t work if you block out
the radio signals. I told him to bite me.

As far as EVP, I thought someone tried that and you can get &quot;normal&quot; EVP.

&gt; I just had a thought go thru my head ( Oh shit ).What would happen if you
&gt; put a voice recorder in a
&gt; Faraday Cage, and have a session with a ghost box.... The Faraday Cage
&gt; isn&#x27;t supposed to pick up radio
&gt; interference right ? Would it pick up the other voices or not ? I know the
&gt; entities are talking thru the radio
&gt; but has anyone ever tried it ? Stupid question huh ?????
