The ghosts who are producing the EVP&#39;s certainly don&#39;t\n&gt; have brains. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; I have no doubt that there may be a few people around who could create EVP\n&gt; phenomena in an electrronic device, but it would be an extremely small\n&gt; number. I think most of the EVP we get are from disembodied beings who\n&gt; have figured out how to do it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Zack\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, 17 Sep 2007, Frank Sumption wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s not brain! We are all spirit, of course we can create our own EVPs. You don&#39;t suddenly become spirit when you die, you just wake up. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t ask questions, I don&#39;t want to create the answers I&#39;m looking for.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
