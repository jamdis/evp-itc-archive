            I use Adobe as well.  Just try the scientific filter, then clip and pop reduction and amplify using 3 to 6 boost.  Don't do too much more otherwise it will hurt your audio clip.  In addition, always save the original.
   
            If you want to go through a clip together a few times, please feel free to email me under separate cover and I will be more than happy to assist you.
   
            Looking forward to hearing your research!

advice for cleaning up that radio static?
