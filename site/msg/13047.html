<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>weve been doing some work with the radio shack box and this one in 
particular is important. my husbands father died when he was young and  
his uncle was murdered a few years ago. in many box sessions he has 
heard the two of them saying certain key things. in this session he 
asks for comfirmation that it is him. and askes how he died. at 0:22 
and 0:30 you hear something. i was wondering if anyone else heard the 
same thing. like i said in a previous post him and i sometimes hear 
different words.like at 0:22. it may be a gender thing or not but at 
0:30 we deffinately hear the same thing. i have put the file in 
my &quot;folder&quot; for anyone to hear. it is under norther il ghost hunting 
team. thanks everone for your time.
