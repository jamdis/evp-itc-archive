&gt; Angela,
&gt; 
&gt; If you are looking to get started with a simple ghost box,
&gt; i would 
&gt; suggest a 20-125 model by radio shack.  It incorporates a
&gt; speaker and 
&gt; is able to sweep AM, FM and shortwave.  The simple
&gt; procedure is on my 
&gt; site.
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.keyportparanormal.com/simpleghostboxhack.html
&gt; 
&gt; Other models that are available for the hack are as
&gt; follows:
&gt; 
&gt; 12-469 (New Model White)---Pull the Mute pin off the board
&gt; once 
&gt; opened.
&gt; 
&gt; 20-125 --- Cut wire on ribbon going to the &quot;Mute&quot;
&gt; markings on the 
&gt; board.
&gt; 
&gt; 12-820 --- Cut wire going to &quot;Mute&quot; on the board
&gt; 
&gt; 12-150 --- Cut Wire going to &quot;Mute&quot; on the board.
&gt;  This is my latest 
&gt; find and is a bit harder to get at the wiring, but can be
&gt; done.  It 
&gt; also incorporates a built in speaker.
&gt; 
&gt; 12-469 and 12-820 will need an external speaker, but they
&gt; come with 
&gt; earbuds.  I use a 21-549 speaker from radio shack, it works
&gt; well and 
&gt; is fairly inexpensive.

&gt; &gt; Hi Angela
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; LOL! Why dont they just give the winning lotto numbers
&gt; that would 
&gt; be 
&gt; &gt; easier to aquire =)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Personally I never seek to prove this to anyone, they
&gt; should 
&gt; &gt; prove/disprove it themselves. Even amongst those who
&gt; arent 
&gt; skeptics, 
&gt; &gt; hearing varies. Sometimes everyones hears the same
&gt; sometimes they 
&gt; &gt; dont. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I also dont ask about lotto numbers LOL I dont play
&gt; it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As for building one yourself, most are trying out the
&gt; radio 
&gt; &gt; modifications like the 12-470 or the 12-469 (horrible
&gt; clicking on 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; 469 model but a few have gotten around it. Theres a
&gt; few others 
&gt; Frank 
&gt; &gt; and Steve have messed with. I think ones the 12-125
&gt; but I am a bit 
&gt; &gt; tired so all the model numbers arent popping in my
&gt; head at the 
&gt; moment.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; A few &quot;how to&quot; videos have been posted on
&gt; youtube. You can type in 
&gt; &gt; the model numbers to access a few of Mike
&gt; Colletta&#x27;s (ufogeek)
&gt; &gt; available posts as well as several others who have
&gt; made thier video 
&gt; &gt; instructions available online. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I did try out a fan test session the other day. Tho
&gt; they werent as 
&gt; &gt; loud as with water, I could still discern a few
&gt; statements. They 
&gt; were 
&gt; &gt; so &quot;bass&quot; in tone that its almost out of my
&gt; hearing range on a few 
&gt; so 
&gt; &gt; I didnt post them all. As for the ones I did they can
&gt; be found on 
&gt; my 
&gt; &gt; esnips 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; http://www.esnips.com/web/MiscellaneousMethodsofEVP
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That should take ya to the right folder

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi everyone, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m sure lots of you know who James Randi is,
&gt; the skeptic who 
&gt; &gt; offers $1 
&gt; &gt; &gt; million for proof of the paranormal. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am wondering why there hasn&#x27;t been an EVP
&gt; demonstration good 
&gt; &gt; enough 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to win the prize. I have never captured an EVP,
&gt; but many people 
&gt; &gt; have 
&gt; &gt; &gt; including those in this group. I cannot say (like
&gt; James Randi 
&gt; &gt; &gt; apparently and others like him) that I think
&gt; every person who 
&gt; &gt; captured 
&gt; &gt; &gt; an EVP is a fraud or captured a fluke or
&gt; something like that. I 
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; &gt; think that at all, it appears to me that many of
&gt; them are the 
&gt; real 
&gt; &gt; &gt; deal, of that I am almost 100% certain and will
&gt; be 100% certain 
&gt; if 
&gt; &gt; I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; can ever capture my own. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know a lot about James Randi or EVP
&gt; for that matter, but 
&gt; it 
&gt; &gt; is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; a question that came up. Can anyone enlighten me?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I tried a few sessions last night but came up
&gt; empty handed. I am 
&gt; &gt; &gt; starting to think my white noise isn&#x27;t loud
&gt; enough. I&#x27;m going to 
&gt; &gt; keep 
&gt; &gt; &gt; trying. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also I hope to experiment with ITC images. And
&gt; soon I want to 
&gt; build 
&gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;box&quot; which I keep hearing so much
&gt; about. I don&#x27;t know the 
&gt; first 
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing about these ghost/spirit boxes as I&#x27;ve
&gt; heard them called, 
&gt; all 
&gt; &gt; I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; know is I want to learn to build one and use it
&gt; as I&#x27;ve heard 
&gt; some 
&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting audio files here. But that&#x27;s
&gt; probably a good subject 
&gt; &gt; for a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; separate post unless anyone can give me an
&gt; informative how-to 
&gt; link 
&gt; &gt; or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!
