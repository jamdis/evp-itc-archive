              I have posted a log sheet if you want to use it in the file section. This may also help in aiding you with your sessions.  Just remember once your rock n rolling your questions along with their responses just may lead you in a direction you may never intended.  Be quick on your feet, but try to preplan if you can.
   
             Also, I always try and ask them if they have any questions for me or if I can deliver a message of any kind.  I never want them to think that its all about me and getting the information I WANT!  You would never have a conversation with a live friend always taking over the topic.  For if that was the case I would not have any friends, LOL.  
   
            You may also get communication for only you to hear, in which case you may discover that your recorder has been turned off.  I have attached a clip where I tell them to stop shutting up my recorder and their response is sarcastic as if they had no clue to what I was talking about.  I love their sense of humor!

quickly (I often times write them down prior to a session). The
reason being I have noticed that many people drag the questions or ask
more than one question prior to getting a response. Please note that
in my research I have on occasion spoken over them and get not the
immediate response because I was too busy talking. I have even gotten
from my tec David to ("I'm Talking) which was funny cause anyone that
knows me, knows I love to gab, lol. I have attached to clips so you
can see what I am talking about. The first one David tells me that
basicly I needed to listen and not speak, for he was not done. The
second, Joel is asking a questions and the question seems to go on and
on, only to have David say "Joel Speak Up".
