I am sorry I missed your posts and I can understand how anyone would see th=
at as insulting.

My hands have been very full for the past two weeks and=
=C2=A0I am sorry for that.=C2=A0 Death and all the things that come with it=

Ummmmmmmmmmm lets see.=C2=A0 OH!=C2=A0 you asked me what I am?=C2=A0 I a=
m a Deist, with strong leanings in the directions of Pantheism and Humanita=
rianism.=C2=A0 I am an active member of the Democrat party and a very proud=
 American.=C2=A0 I have nothing to hide and love people for who they are.=
=C2=A0 I just ask for the same back.

I am a Paranormal Investigator and ha=
ve been for several years.=C2=A0 Prior to that I was an Investigator here i=
n the Beautiful State of Tennessee for approximately ten years.

I have not=
 been able to be that active with any field research in a while because I w=
as=C2=A0the primary Caregiver for a termly ill person for the past six year=
s.=C2=A0 But I did and still do research work.

Is there anything else you =
would like to know?=C2=A0 Oh, and who the hell are you? LOL
