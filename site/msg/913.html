&gt; I very much dislike the concept, and activity of &quot;ghost huning&quot;,  
&gt; there too
&gt; many egos, associated wiht it, to many that think they are the  
&gt; worlds only
&gt; paranoramal experts, and way too much focus on the negative, and  
&gt; &quot;scary&quot;
&gt; aspects.  My systems are not designed for that ....stuff, and I can&#x27;t
&gt; support those activities, even it means that I don&#x27;t personaly put  
&gt; any more
&gt; of my boxes out there in the public. The information for making  
&gt; this stuff
&gt; is out there, and others can build this stuff, and do whatever they  
&gt; want
&gt; with it. I doubt if there will be many &quot;Frank&#x27;s Box&quot; clones out  
&gt; there, while
&gt; the circuits are straight forward, it takes the &quot;certain  
&gt; understanding&quot; to
&gt; get it to work.
