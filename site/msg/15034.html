=A0
A mistake that a =
lot of people make is thinking that there are two different types of energy=
 at work when it comes to sound waves and electromagnetic waves. The only t=
hing that seperates them is frequency and power. Radio waves are radio wave=
s because they occupy a certain block of the electromagnietic spectrum. Sou=
nd waves exist on that same spectrum just farther down with much longer wav=
es. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can penetrate almost anything because of =
their wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength the more ways we can shield a=
gainst them.
=A0
Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and te=
lemetry transmitting wave but the waves also have a physical effect on our =
environment by causing molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A little =
lower than this is IR or infrared it too can cause physical objects to heat=
 up but usually it just causes molecules to rotate in place. All physical t=
hings give off IR light. Its a way the total system conserves energy by spo=
ntaneously emitting IR radiation.

Here is some food for thought. I am currently reviewing my =
audio from our May 30th investigation.
=A0
It was me and another girl teamm=
ate=A0present in the room. I picked up a 3rd female voice on my digital voi=
ce recorder that I carry with me. We were standing right next to another di=
gital video recorder that I leave beside my night vision camera. That recor=
der did not pick up this 3rd voice. I have asked the girl that was with me =
to check her recording to see if she picked it up.
=A0
I have long felt the=
 true EVP does not come from sound waves in the environment, or then it wou=
ldn't be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are appearing directly=
 on the recordings.
=A0
This instance with the recorders may back that theo=
ry up. That other recorder should have picked that voice up if it were soun=
d waves in the environment.
=A0
I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. =
The=A0file that is named=A0"01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip.=A0You will hea=
r my voice as I say "Yeah", and then another comes in right after that. I t=
hink I know what it says.
=A0
Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but st=
ill did not hear this until playback. It isn't clear, so I am not as excite=
d about it as my one's from the last investigation.

I have a=
 running theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated e=
xactly where they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principl=
e. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequency the=
n if you add or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or alternat=
e frequency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you h=
ave an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz the=
n you will have a intermediate difference=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within =
human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all elec=
tronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From=
 this theory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few inches of t=
he recorder.
=A0
We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radio wit=
h superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some pass=
ive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Jos=
eph Pompeii.
