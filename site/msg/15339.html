<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The voltage and electronic reference got me thinking it might be a weapon and so I did a search on google news and came up with a news report from South Korea on June 22nd and 23rd about Red Shark. Red Shark is an anti-sub missle guided torpedo. With the tensions in Korea who knows.. Just a thought, but interesting..

&gt; What if its simpler then that and the voice was talking about itself? Referring to itself as the shark or a predator? Just a thought! ;)

&gt; I had a voice earlier in the latest tape &quot;here comes the shark&quot;, then this morning I pushed play on the tape deck and heard &quot;Jaws has the voltage&quot;. It has to be a metaphor, but for what? Shark is a big nasty fish that eats people, is a shark with a voltage a big nasty monster - what if they mean a comet? Comets have some electrical activity according to McCanny(?)
