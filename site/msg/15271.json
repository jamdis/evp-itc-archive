See I told ya you&#39;d make it to the 60&#39;s soon LOL At this rate you will be there sooner than I thought!\n\nMisty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  I got #51 fired up and working last night--yeah i never finished it before\n&gt; starting the quest for a better tuner--Anyway, I used the 469 radio in 51\n&gt; and it sounds like crap compared to 54--the MK484 box. I used the Arm Band\n&gt; radio in #50, and it sounds good, but with those being discontinued I would\n&gt; be reluctant to give that away. I&#39;ve had that problem with the 469&#39;s, half\n&gt; of them are poor.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
