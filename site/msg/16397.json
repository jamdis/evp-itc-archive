I&#39;m a certified medium with a Spiritualist church. Thi=\r\ns was a two year process which involved proving I can communicate with spir=\r\nits to a congregation (not bragging - just trying to explain my background =\r\nand why I know what I do). I&#39;m also one of the biggest skeptics you&#39;ll ever=\r\n meet (It was one of two reasons I became a medium. I wanted to see how the=\r\ny were &quot;faking&quot; it. Surprise! They weren&#39;t). I&#39;d like to contribute what I&#39;=\r\nve learned about spirits. As Jill wrote, &quot;I(t) really takes personal experi=\r\nence to believe this stuff exists&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;As to her main question of &quot;Why do=\r\n spirits lie&quot;, I don&#39;t think we can always assume they&#39;re lying. If the inf=\r\normation comes through a medium, one of the first items to address is wheth=\r\ner or not the medium received the message correctly and then whether or not=\r\n he/she interepreted it correctly and phrased it in a way that allowed the =\r\nrecipient to understand the spirit&#39;s meaning. There are a variety of ways s=\r\npirits communicate with mediums; some are easier than others to understand =\r\nand pass on. For the harder methods, it would be possible for a medium to i=\r\nnadvertently misinterept the message based on his/her past experiences. \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;When we look at the question from the connection to EVP&#39;s and ghost boxe=\r\ns, we have to examine a few items. Was the spirit able to use the devices c=\r\norrectly to form the words he/she actually intended? This is a two step pro=\r\ncess. It can be difficult for them to not only pull the available energy in=\r\nto a useable form, but to also form the correct words (think it as a foreig=\r\nner learning English and saying &quot;car&quot; when they mean &quot;star&quot;. They sound sim=\r\nilar, but have very different meanings). \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Did we understand the words =\r\nthey said? It&#39;s fairly easy to get them wrong, especially in instances wher=\r\ne you aren&#39;t the first person to listen to the recording and someone else s=\r\nays, &quot;Here listen to this. I think they&#39;re saying (fill in the blank)&quot;. Our=\r\n brains are going to tell us (fill in the blank) simply because that though=\r\nt is now prevalent. If we&#39;re the only person listening to the recordings, t=\r\nhe same mistake can be made. The only conclusive way is to use equipment th=\r\nat can amplify and break down the recordings to make them clear enough to b=\r\ne agreed upon by a number of people who don&#39;t know what conclusions the oth=\r\ner listeners have drawn. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The idea of a spirit distorting the facts mu=\r\nst also be considered. Not lying, per se, but rather getting the facts with=\r\nin their reality confused. This is where you have the right to have the fac=\r\nts validated by the spirit. Ask them to prove it to you. They can tell you =\r\nsome corresponding items that back up their claims, direct you to old newsp=\r\naper stories or to a person they used to affiliate with or bring the valida=\r\ntion into your focus (meaning the same thing comes into your life while you=\r\n&#39;re driving/working/ at home/talking to someone/reading and etc.) at least =\r\nthree times. A spirit who is being truthful will not mind trying to make th=\r\nis happen. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Once these have been considered and eliminated, then we sh=\r\nould be willing to entertain the idea the spirit may be a lower energy bein=\r\ng (a bully/swindler/ con-man or woman/narcissist and etc) in their past lif=\r\ne and this is the only way they know how to achieve what they want. And yes=\r\n, those spirits do exist. &quot;As in life, so in death&quot;, meaning our personalit=\r\nies don&#39;t change when our bodies die.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Al, maybe he wasn&#39;t trying to pr=\r\nove anything. Is it possible the spirit voice didn&#39;t mean he WAS (typed lar=\r\nger for emphasis) Steve Tate, but rather wanted to talk ABOUT Steve Tate or=\r\n get a message TO Steve Tate? Did he mean to say &quot;Still fate&quot;? Could he hav=\r\ne meant &quot;paratrooper&quot;? See where I&#39;m going with this? \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;And finally, in=\r\n regards to the &quot;end of the world stuff&quot;, it has been taught to me by mediu=\r\nms and teachers who were all very honest and excellent at what they do, and=\r\n it has been relayed to me by spirits I&#39;ve encountered in my mediumship ser=\r\nvice that we don&#39;t have a free glimpse of the future once our bodies die an=\r\nd we move into spirit form. I mean no offense and I&#39;m not impying that wasn=\r\n&#39;t what was heard. That said (or rather &#39;typed&#39;), I&#39;d be VERY hesitant to b=\r\nelieve this communication. There are beings that are privvy to the potentia=\r\nl (underscore &quot;potential&quot;) future in our lives, but it isn&#39;t their nature t=\r\no join us for EVP sessions. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I hope I haven&#39;t taken liberty with this =\r\nforum by posting such a long reply. I thank you for your time and attention=\r\n. If you have other questions or would like me to clarify something, please=\r\n ask.

See where I&#39;m going with this? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And finally=\r\n, in regards to the &quot;end of the world stuff&quot;, it has been taught to\n me by =\r\nmediums and teachers who were all very honest and excellent at what they do=\r\n, and it has been relayed to me by spirits I&#39;ve encountered in my mediumshi=\r\np service that we don&#39;t have a free glimpse of the future once our bodies d=\r\nie and we move into spirit form. I mean no offense and I&#39;m not impying that=\r\n wasn&#39;t what was heard. That said (or rather &#39;typed&#39;), I&#39;d be VERY hesitant=\r\n to believe this communication. There are beings that are privvy to the pot=\r\nential (underscore &quot;potential&quot;) future in our lives, but it isn&#39;t their nat=\r\nure to join us for EVP sessions. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I hope I haven&#39;t taken liberty wit=\r\nh this forum by posting such a long reply. I thank you for your time and at=\r\ntention. If you have other questions or would like me to clarify something,=\r\n please ask. I&#39;d be honored to share what I know and track down what I don&#39;=\r\nt. :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Michelle&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- cg26.c1.mail.mud.ya=\r\nhoo.com compressed/chunked Wed Dec  9 14:28:12 PST 2009 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n  =\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-673016809-1260412737=:97724--"}
