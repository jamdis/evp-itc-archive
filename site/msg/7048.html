Pretty cool summation Ann...a scene out of Westworld...!
   
  The time I spend watching TV Novellas (soap operas) here in Mexico has gone down since I joined this Club.  Actually, it's more like reality email.  Dynamic group.   
   
  If this series is now over, when can the principal come back to the show?...soon, I hope...after all, he may have the kill switch for next series.  Oh yes, I apologize to everyone for anything.  LOL Ron L

          Steve,

I certainly respect and support the idea that none of us is a messiah
and none of us has all the answers, but that is not germane to the
issue here. This is about how to correctly and fairly moderate a list.

If this was the wild west, things would have transpired something like
this:

Bruce stood in the public street and offered a completely legitimate
exchange with the townsfolk.

Laura walked out of the saloon and took a shot at Bruce and at the
window of Frank S's telegraph office.

Bruce shot back at Laura.

Johnny Marlboro stepped out onto the balcony of the Imperial hotel and
took a shot a Bruce.

Bruce shot back.

Laura pulled out a deputy's badge, stuck it to her lapel, and shot
Bruce dead.

Ann ran out into the street and said, "Don't you think there's a
problem here? Maybe the sheriff needs to step in," to which Laura,
acting under the color of law, replied that if Ann didn't like it she
could leave town and if she stayed she better not question authority
again. 

That's what happened here. That's the issue.

I'm still standing here saying something is wrong. Shoot me.

Ann
