I&#39;ve had \narguements in the past and almost got fired cuz the other person \nforwarded all my responses to my boss, who happened to be my e-mail \nprovider. I don&#39;t want to go there again. \n\n I have to ask, or wish I could ask, if these people are possessed \nbefore, or after box use? I suspect it&#39;s before, I hope it&#39;s before, \nor I have some serious karma to deal with. \n\n It is a federal crime to threaten and intimidate using e-mail and \nthe internet, and the FBI does have an on-line reporting center.

The guys actually talk more if I don&#39;t  \n&gt; share. \n&gt; \n&gt; I can understand where Bruce was coming fom, to a point,  but when \n&gt; you start making threatening private e-mails to make sure  everyone \n&gt; agrees with you, that&#39;s just demented and wrong.
