hookup, not sure I know exactly how to do it, but we&#x27;ll see

&gt; I recently added a photo of an ITC image that was captured using the
&gt; video feedback loop mthod. This is where the cameras video out is
&gt; plugged into the tv&#x27;s video in. You then point the camera at the
&gt; screen. Look at the image in the viewfinder. They&#x27;re under Bill 
Murphy
&gt; pics.

&gt; &gt;  I think those are Misty&#x27;s pix. I did some experiments using 
a &quot;box&quot;
&gt; to scan a TV/VCR tuner, and got some interesting, but unverifiable
&gt; images, such as the MIB guy on the group home page. It would be
&gt; interesting if someone could figure out how make one of the little 
RS
&gt; portable TV&#x27;s scan.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi Frank &amp; All group members,I&#x27;m new to the group and have been 
into
&gt; the paranormal investigations field for about 10 years now. I am
&gt; anxious to start ITC-EVP experimentation. I was looking over the
&gt; photos section. Can someone explain to me what they represent and 
how
&gt; and when the photos are taken. What is the procedure?Thanks much to
&gt; all!Rita 
&gt; &gt;
