After tearing it apart, cutting, desoldering, etc...to \nlocate\n&gt; the mute wire/pin/solder pad, I found out that it can be one of the\n&gt; easiest hacks out there. \n&gt; \n&gt; Rather than disassembling and such, simply cut the trace on each \nside\n&gt; of the mute pin solder pad. Takes about 30 seconds with a hobby \nknife.\n&gt; I felt really stupid after 4 hours taking everything apart and\n&gt; desoldering wires, etc...\n&gt; \n&gt; instructions with photos can be found on my blog if interested. \n&gt; \n&gt; http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?\nfuseaction=blog.view&friendID=405441717&blogID=445524854\n&gt; \n&gt; The sound quality of this thing really rocks, and I love the \nexternal\n&gt; antenna options...\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks \n&gt; Andy\n&gt;"}
