In my own experience with the one group, and what  \nother spirits have told me about them, I tend to think, there are 2  \ngroups.\n\nThe group that Sandra talks about is very helpful, but she doesn&#39;t  \nhave enough info. on her site for me to actually examine the group she  \ndealt with. Mr. Smith (AAEVP) refers to them as demons. I&#39;m not sure  \nI&#39;d go that far, but yeah, ok - my experience was fairly nasty. Was  \nthat because they are so called &quot;demons&quot; which I think is a ridiculous  \nterm btw, or just immature, yet very clever spirits who get a kick out  \nof causing trouble - or trying to? I just don&#39;t know.\n\n From hearing both descriptions, I&#39;d say there may be 2 groups or  \nmaybe only one &quot;real&quot; Fish Group and another band of roving nasty  \nspiritual beasties who want you to think they&#39;re the Fish Group to  \ngive them an &quot;in&quot; to talk to you - invade your world so to speak.\n\nIf they said they were a band of crazy demons, would you talk to them?  \nlol! :D\nBut if they said they&#39;re the Fish Group, I&#39;d be like OH! Ok, let&#39;s see  \nwhat they say...\n\nw.\nOn Aug 18, 2008, at 2:22 PM, Lisby wrote:\n\n&gt; Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s more likely that they&#39;re both? I always try to  \n&gt; follow the crime investigation maxim that the simplest explanation  \n&gt; is the most likely. Why should there be two groups? Why not just one  \n&gt; full of anarchists, loyal neither to black or white? Most everything  \n&gt; in this world falls into the area of gray. I think it&#39;s therefore  \n&gt; likely that this is true of the next.\n\n\nWhy 2 g oups... because he 2 desc ip ions o each g oup a e so adically di e en .
