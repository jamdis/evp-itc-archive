Welcome to the group Ben =) Its a mix and match group. Some are researchers, some are ghosthunters, some just are here out of curiousity or to investigate the things going on around them. 

  We look forward to your input. 
   
  Ya know I think I still have some of your evp's you guys recorded for the Ashleys investigation ages ago. I should run them thru my p1 filter to see if we missed out on anything. LOL
   
  I did that to some of my early recordings and was surprised at the results.
