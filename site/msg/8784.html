&gt; Cool Debbie. Sending all 1.5 million of them to him now hehehe. 
Just 
&gt; kiddin. I wouldnt know where to start/end. 
&gt; 
&gt; I did get one evp last night I am excited about tho. Was a nice 
gift. A 
&gt; repeat of my very first evp from my mother, saying exactly what she 
&gt; said how she said it all those years ago. A bit off on her soft 
tone 
&gt; voice but the message was the same. It is loud and clear and was 
using 
&gt; ST method which she doesnt like to use usually.
&gt; 
&gt; I was always a bit disheartened that I didnt know what I was doing 
when 
&gt; I got that first message and screwed up on saving it before my pc 
&gt; crashed. I didnt think it would ever be recovered completely to how 
I 
&gt; heard it that night. But for this one I saved it right, no pc 
crashin 
&gt; goin on, and now I am left with a nice repeat today to hold onto.
&gt; 
&gt; I may post that to the files area in a bit.
