I got it at Radio Shack.  They had \ntheir own brand there too, but theirs was about $12 more.  I think \nthey just started carrying the &quot;ListenUp&quot; brand.  I like the blue \nlight effect too...\nThe earbuds came with the mic, but they are not amplifeid, just the \nmic is.\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike, one more question for you:\n&gt; \n&gt; What&#39;s the brand of amplified mic you are using and does Radio \nSHack \n&gt; have it, too?  It seems to be a bit better than the amplified lapel \n&gt; mic I am using inside my echo chamber.  I am experimenting with two \n&gt; mics, as when I added the splitter I couldn&#39;t get any audio out of \nit \n&gt; like you do.  It must either be the mic you are using is better, or \n&gt; the headphones/earbuds you use are amplified (??).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have produced another video, this one of my completed portable \n&gt; Ghost \n&gt; &gt; Box System (Mike&#39;s Box 12.470)\n&gt; &gt; This video, in three parts on YouTube walks you through how the \n&gt; chamber \n&gt; &gt; system works, while describing the components and going through \nthe \n&gt; &gt; description of how to control the devices with the chamber closed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Video - Portable Ghost Box System Part 1 of 3\n&gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUOkWGrz94s\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Video - Portable Ghost Box System Part 2 of 3\n&gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirOLjEf1bQ\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Video - Portable Ghost Box System Part 3 of 3\n&gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs7ep7-G7Aw\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
