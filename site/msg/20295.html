<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think these skeptics purpose is to keep main stream science from looking
at certain taboo subjects, almost like a religion trying to keep itself
pure. It aslmost has to be the universities that fund these people,
otehrwise why would they waste their time, unless they are so lame this is
the only way they can make a name for themselves. Science in this country is
mostly out dated dogma that they pass off a absolute irrefutable gospel
truth that must not be questioned, as if all is known, and all has been
discovered.
