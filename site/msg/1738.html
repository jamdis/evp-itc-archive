<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This stuff can get kinda weird. I had another box request recieved a via 
snail mail, asking for a &quot;digital box&quot;, I don&#x27;t know where they got idea. 
They also sent along a series of CDs that were excepts of channeled material 
talking about &quot;the telephone to the dead&quot;. I thought I would at least see 
what was on it, so started listening to the first CD, the dog went totally 
bonkers, running around the house barking and howling! I stpped the play 
back, and put the stuff back in it&#x27;s box to ship back.

The little that I did hear, as I kinda scanned through the first track, was 
pretty religious sounding, with some guy talking in a very deep mono tone. I 
don&#x27;t have time to try to sort that BS out, and I am not impressed with 
supposed spiritual revelations.  Ya reach a point after 40 years of reading, 
and other sources, that you develope pretty good BS detectors. I got 
interested in paranormal stuff when I was 13.

I also get the flickering lights, and thumps in the walls, but nothing ever 
burns up, or stops working, except from normal failure.
