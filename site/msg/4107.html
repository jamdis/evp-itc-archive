<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi All,

First I should take a moment to say hi to all the new members.

Hi =) 

Welcome to the group. The files and links sections as well as archive 
message search should answer most of your questions (if you have any) 
or feel free to post and ask. Everyone is usually more than willing 
to help out.

Last but not least.

Messages not going through right away sometimes? Believe me I know it 
can be aggravating. I assure you it is nothing we (owners/moderators) 
are doing. For those of you that it marks as spam we have no idea why 
it does that. It&#x27;s done it to both of the Franks. It&#x27;s not like your 
new here or anything weird is in the posts LOL.

Frank S set the group up as unmoderated so I dont know why it picks 
on a few of you now and then and holds your messages until one of us 
approves them (which we always do when we get online). 

The YaNOhoo software has its faults as well as its advantages. So 
thanks for your patience when it occasionally kicks into spamcop mode.

Misty</pre>
