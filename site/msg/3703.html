Thanks. Spiricom did use 13 tone generators as away of produce something l=
ike that raw audio. Then transmitted the tones a short distance so they cou=
ld modulated by the spirits. What I think we've found is you don't have to =
transmit raw audio, the entities can manipuilate it in the electronics, it =
would seem. These days you can make four tone generators on a chip much sma=
ller then a dime. So you could have multiple tones in a small space, then w=
ith newer digital switching techniques, combine the tones in a way that wou=
ld similate speech bits. The goal as with all of this stuff is clear commun=
cation. I think it is way too soon, and not enough work has been done for a=
nyone to try to create theory of how this stuff work.   I used radio becasu=
e it's a convienient source of raw audio, but becasue of noise, and the var=
iations in the number of stations in different areas, it makes it an unreli=
able method. It works great here in Denver, it's not so good up in Cheyenne=
, Wyo, or Grand Junction, Co.    Frank-S

I have read about tone generators myself but th=

oscope/tone generator? I know it was considered for a while to be the most =
successful, but it was very electronic or synthetic in sound and required q=
uite an operational budget and space.I think with your invention we have re=
ached the cusp of being able to create the walkman of EVP/ITC - we're almos=
t there. And with the discovery of the Radioshack mod and the experience we=
 and others have had since your box first debuted I think we're almost to t=
he point where it will be very inexpensive to make a reliable box and/or so=
mething that the average person could make following instructions.Of course=
 the holy grail is something that reliably generates clear voices every tim=
e with little or no white noise. I know I read that someone was trying to c=
reate a device that did that, created the white noise and then cancelled it=
 out, hopefully leaving you with just the voice.Oh, and a reliable televisi=
on ITC device would be quite the find too. I plan on creating a RS mod box =
that will be self contained and portable...and my thought was if it works r=
eliably I wonder if I could integrate a simply video ITC generator into it =
as well. It would be great to be able to capture both audio and video.Anywa=
ys, carry on Frank. I know you're doing good work. IF you search the intern=

 I've been into all my life without knowing what it was (I'm 30 now, I firs=

 by seemingly coherant sounds that would come out of random noise on my clo=
ck radio in my bedroom as a kid, from what sounded like voices (thought I w=
as crazy for a while) to even morse code - for a long time one of my radios=
 would produce random clicks or pops even when the speaker was off. My dad =
jokingly suggested it was morse code, so I studied morse code and discovere=
d that at least some of it could be morse letters...usually they would spel=
l one word and then gibberish.Anyways, once I learned what EVP was I began =
messing around with recorders etc. My first clear recording came from using=
 EVP maker and was someone saying 'we have been waiting for you.' A few day=
s later, after a frustrating lack of communication they just told me 'build=
 a box.(this happened to be after I learned of frank.)' I've been looking a=
t all the boxes and their positives and negatives and this is what I'm seei=

 thought for a cost-effective, low-tech alternative is to combine the two i=
n that you create a radio shack mod like the UFOGeek one (multiple radios, =
a mixer, etc) and run it through an echo box.Personally I believe that anal=
og is giving the best results overall, and I think it has to do with ease o=
f manipulating the signal. Therefore my thought is taking a digital white n=
oise signal like that produced by the radio shack mods and then essentially=
 broadcasting it into the echo chamber and having a mic pick it up gives yo=
u the analog aspect.My question is has anyone tried this? And I was hoping =
