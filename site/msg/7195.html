Hi Frank,
 
Hmmm, how would the 12 step program start for you?
 
1.  PUT DOWN THE BOX.......
2. STEP AWAY FROM YOUR WORKBENCH
3.  GO UPSTAIRS AND HUG AND KISS YOUR WIFE
4.  SIT DOWN AT THE KITCHEN TABLE WITH A SMOKE AND A CUP OF  COFFEE
5-12 ???????
 
On second thought I think it should be called the (5) step program for you  
and even then it may only last a few hours or maybe even a day.  Even in  your 
sleep I bet you still hear voice calling "if you build it we will  come".  
Kind of hard to resist the calling.
 
Good luck,
 
Jeff

I think I need the 12 step program for board builders! I have the  
LA1135 radio wired---already, and ready to start testing Friday 
night.  There has to be a reason I didn't use that chip, but the 
breadboarded  version seemed to work ok, but that was a couple years 
ago. The goal is to  make sure I have the best possible radio, and 
audio output, then make more  printed circuit boards.
