The other side is the scientific aspect of\nthis research. In my view, both sides are equally important.\n\nEspecially in the field of borderland sciences, transparency is most\nimportant to maintain credibility. It&#39;s not about convincing skeptics\nbut to be taken serious by really interested people. We shouldn&#39;t give\nthem unnecessary reasons for doubt in this important research if it can\nbe avoided easily.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Hi all,\n\n&gt; just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I would\n&gt; suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, in\n&gt; order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can for\n&gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including\n&gt; the experimenter&#39;s voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, but\n&gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP match\n&gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should always\n&gt; be provided along with the edited version.\n\n&gt; But that&#39;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to express, as\n&gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical public.\n\n&gt; Stefan"}
