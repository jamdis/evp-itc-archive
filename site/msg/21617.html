Since the 70s, huh? I'm sorry, but I have to disagree. Well, maybe I've
bee=
n imagining things for the past ten years, but there have been a host
of re=
searchers inventing real-time communication devices that produce
some prett=
y convincing intelligent responses, or "EVP."

No disrespect intended, but =
do you really think that this scientist is
an expert in EVP because he wrot=
e a book that wasn't even picked up by a
real publisher? That doesn't fly w=
ith people who have been doing this
for ages and who have been producing ex=
ceptional results. A person can't
just saunter into a field such as this wi=
th a Ph.D. and flash a book
around claiming to know it all. In my humble op=
inion, this isn't a field
that can be targeted for scientific research. The=
re are too many
variables to consider, most of which we know nothing about.=
 It's nearly
impossible to prove that EVP is real, scientifically or not, b=
ecause
there are always skeptics who will claim it's all fake. (And of cour=
se,
everyone else knows better, right?)  I've read several journal articles=

and papers written by university professors and serious researchers, and
f=
rom what I've learned, you can try as many times as you want to have a
"con=
trolled" environment for so-called "scientific" EVP research, but it
will f=
ail, over and over. You know why? The human element will
interfere, whether=
 it's during the experiment or afterward, every time.
Now, I'm not saying y=
our belief that this book is good is ridiculous
because it must have value =
for you, or you wouldn't have posted it. I
would like to point out, however=
, that you might consider a more open
minded approach before waltzing into =
a group like this and insulting its
population with your particular phraseo=
logy. We are all somewhat learned
individuals, and we are particularly well=
-read in this field. Please do
not assume we are unaware of anything.
