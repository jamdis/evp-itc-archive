<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This stuff confusing, &quot;they&quot; act like the time is right now, and I wonder if the Mayans left cuz it was &quot;right now&quot;. For ten years &quot;they&quot; (box contacts) act like the end is right now, and I&#x27;m supposed leave &quot;right now&quot;, as if I can just jump off the planet. I&#x27;m like dudes! I was kidnapped and brought here, they didn&#x27;t let me grab my spare ship!

&gt; oh, most certainly life is forever, just in different form.  I just had it in my

&gt; that the spirits are wrong on this
&gt; Thanks for putting me a little bit at ease :)

&gt;  Well, keep in mind that just because it comes out of spirit communcation 
&gt; doens&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s 100%. Besides, what we are pretty sure of with EVP is life is 
&gt; forever, not dependent on the physical environment.

&gt; &gt;Hello Frank, I just want to say how scary this is - that a comet is coming and 
&gt; &gt;there is nothing to do about it.
