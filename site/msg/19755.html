<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I know ya think everyone should believe, and I get the Jesus voices, too, I
just don&#x27;t buy it. The concept of not believing in a savior and being either
forever dead or condemned to hell just don&#x27;t make any sense. EVP, and just
about everything paranormal proves that life is forever, no strings
attached. I don&#x27;t care how much they sugar coat the stuff, it&#x27;s still giving
your soul, spirit.--freedom, to some unkonwn entity, and that ain&#x27;t good.
Everyone I know, with out exceptiion the was &quot;born again&quot; became someone
else, someone evil that would back stab freinds and family for the slightest
gain. Lie cheat and steal. What about all the really evil, vile
televangelists out there? Preaching hell&#x27;s fire during the day, chasing
little boys and doing drugs at night. Try doing some reverse speech on these
freaks! We have one of those evil clowns right here in Colorado. Why don&#x27;t
your Jesus keep evil away for these little megolomainiacs? That&#x27;s cuz he is
that which you fear in the ultimate diguise! Think about it, call the being
from the white light evil and lure all others into darkness. It&#x27;s not rocket
science!

 I have to side with Hultay, go make yourself a group just for true
believers.

 Freedom of religion is by definition freedom from religion!
