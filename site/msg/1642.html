Hi Frank
I agree with you as far as picking up the energy of those around f=
ocusing, It was really hard to tell. For years I have experienced a wave of=
 nausea around a variety of energy feilds. I felt light headed and nausea a=
round Bill's box. Now this might be silly and/or psychosymatic but when I l=
isten to the files posted (from my comp) on this site, of the box EVP's, I =
feel a nausea as well. I am thinking it is more likely a manifestation in m=
y mind, but then again I rule nothing out, just make note! Again I am a ske=
ptic by nature but not because I do not want to believe. I personally seek =
truth even when it is not in my liking, perhaps because I want so much to b=
elieve. Im sure many of us here can relate. Another thing about my first ex=
perience with the box was, Bill asked if there was any one in the room it w=
anted to communicate too? It said Tina   Maria (twice I heard it), and anot=
her person's name that was present in the room, it also kept calling Bill t=
he
 owners name. I never opened my mouth the whole time. I felt that to man=
y people in the room were talking at the box and to each other, which "almo=
st"??? seemed to render it in effective. I personally think that we do not =
need to ask it any questions or call upon any specific spirit etc... for it=
 to communicate. What is there will utilize the white noise and expose itse=
lf. I am very new to this and do not claim to know much.....but I certainly=
 feel this box is in its pioneer stage of something credible. Thanx for you=
r thoughts Frank. How do I get a box made? Im sure you have posted it somew=
here, and I am too new to do it myself at this time.

Thanks Tinamarie;

I wonder if y=

box? That's =
something I'm skeptical about, as the box builder. I don't think 
it's need=
ed. When I do my sessions I ask no questions, and don't ask for any

of=
 running it.

Did you hear anything out of the box?
