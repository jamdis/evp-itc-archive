I am trying to get Deepak Chopra to examine the transcript.  He knew Michael Jackson personally and should be able to verify the contents. I have sent several emails to Deepak Chopra&#39;s publicist.  She keeps reading them but not responding.  The transcript is very personal and I am keeping it private but I was left with something that I can make public.\n\nThis is word for word:\n&quot;If people ask how I am doing tell them I am trying to figure this all out.  I love my children very much and I am so sad on the affect this will have on them.  Bye for now Michael.&quot;\n\nIf anyone has a suggestion or direct contact information for Deepak Chopra please let me know.  I am in San Diego within short driving distance of the Chopra Center. \n\nThx,\nBonnie Vent\nwww.bonnievent.com \n\n   \n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The only thing is, we don&#39;t know WHO&#39;s really saying all this stuff.

I was at a park here in Des Moines, Iowa on June 28th. The\n&gt; &gt; name of the location is Prospect Park. In the original file I ask if MJ can\n&gt; &gt; hear me.....and I get a &quot;yes I can&quot;. Well then I run this through a denoise\n&gt; &gt; program and I hear &quot;yes I can&quot; then a second later I hear a young boy with a\n&gt; &gt; mockish tone say &quot;your talking in the last mike&quot; (also think I hear a young\n&gt; &gt; girl later but can&#39;t make it out)*I MIGHT understand the girl, but won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; make a statement at this time. The boy is easier to hear in the denoised\n&gt; &gt; program (better than Michael). BUT both voices are hard to hear. Maybe you\n&gt; &gt; can amplify for yourself.....that way I won&#39;t SPLATTER the audio to much and\n&gt; &gt; you might be able to adjust for yourself. If someone wants the unedited WAV\n&gt; &gt; file that&#39;s 1.16MB I can send to email address. That way you might be able\n&gt; &gt; to -denoise- or enhance MUCH better than I am able to. I can just make out\n&gt; &gt; what is said........but I assure you&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it is in there!!! I am sending the\n&gt; &gt; MP3 to my files folder, it is the denoised version. I&#39;m not to familiar with\n&gt; &gt; the denoise program so I think I used the default settings. Jim H\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
