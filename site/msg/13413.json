I was wrong. Door to the Dead has exce=\r\neded my worst expectations.\n\n    Generally, I respect John Oliver&#39;s work as=\r\n a medium. While I have no personal experience with him, in the past he has=\r\n looked and acted more genuine than not, the rolling of the eyes put aside =\r\nfor the moment.\n\n    I do take exception to the characterization of the tal=\r\nking box as an Edison device. I have documented the history of Edison, ITC =\r\nand EVP  elsewhere. This is however the smallest concern I have with this s=\r\nhow.\n\n    Prior to wathcing I had just had a conversation with a respected =\r\ncolleague on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena he and others a=\r\nre constantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to that on Door to =\r\nthe Dead. None of those measurements were made by this team. The use of the=\r\nrmal in this situation is not indicated as well.\n\n    The real concern is t=\r\nhat no attempt was made to help this family in a broader context. The skept=\r\nic did and said nothing skeptical as far as I could tell. Key questions wer=\r\ne not asked (at least on-camera) that would reveal the psycho-dynamics of t=\r\nhis family. We know fairly well at this time that PK phenomena is often cen=\r\ntered on a focal person who can exhibit specific characteristics. That the =\r\nteam seems unaware of this is quite disturbing to a person like myself.\n\n  =\r\n  A real research opportunity was lost in this case, as was an opportunity =\r\nto educate the public on the right way to approach such situations. Continu=\r\nally sending the messages that phenomena is based on &#39;demons&#39; and &#39;spirits&#39;=\r\n exclusively does nothing to further the position of serious investigators,=\r\n which is perhaps most troubling of all.\n\n\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_01C2_01C98EA3.1FB7EA50\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;utf-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n=EF=BB=BF&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;ht=\r\ntp://www.w3c.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;MET=\r\nA http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dutf-8&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META c=\r\nontent=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6001.18183&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;B=\r\nACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;Com=\r\nic Sans MS&quot;&gt;LOL&nbsp; Laurie&nbsp; \n:)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;=\r\nFONT face=3D&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our group (6th Sense \nParanormal) =\r\nhad a meeting last night and 2 investigations also.
