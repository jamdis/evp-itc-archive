Old school ghost =

If that theory is still good then I could see how it would help for EVP/IT=

Now that you read =
the warning...

I had to mention this somewhere so I thought I would post i=
t here as you people seem more open to it than my other email groups.

I bo=
ught a cell phone (EMF) sensor a few days ago.=A0 You know like the K2 they=
 used to "supposedly" (jury is still out) talk to ghosts but cheaper.

Well=
 as an EMF sensor, I expected a number of things to set it off.=A0 2 things=
:

1) Hardly anything did set it off.=A0 I was amazed by this.=A0 I had to =
set it directly on my laptop to even pick up the 60 hz from the fans.=A0 Th=
is surprised me.=A0 I had expected it to go nuts with all the wireless this=
 and wireless that, TVs, TIVOs and laptop.=A0 Anyway I thought it was inter=
esting the level of shielding these days.

2) and my real point.=A0 We had =
a big thunder storm come through last night.=A0 I turned it on expecting it=
 to go off when nearby lightning strikes hit.=A0 The amazing thing was that=
 it would go off when there was no lightning and no thunder.=A0 But some re=
ally close strikes did nothing but barely move the needle.

I'm not exactly=
 looking for answers but I was surprised about the storm.=A0 Next storm I'l=
l have to see if it goes off a little before a big strike.=A0 It seemed lik=
e minutes to me between them but I was not paying that much attention.

So,=
 sorry for the off-topic but I did warn you ahead of time so you could just=
 delete.

BTW if anyone has any ideas on that part 2, I'd love to hear it b=
ut it probably needs to be direct email instead of to the list.

Don
