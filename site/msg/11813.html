&gt;
&gt; I heard a lot of what Bill got when he used to post it back on the  
&gt; AA-EVP board. I remember none of it rising above the level of  
&gt; swearing and threats that we get on occasion. The impression I got  
&gt; at the time was that this was a group of deceased humans who had  
&gt; formed a little after-death-prankster club. Yes, they could be quite  
&gt; shitty. If I recall correctly, they called themselves the Fish Group  
&gt; because they said they felt like fish looking out at us through  
&gt; aquarium glass. I thought that was a really interesting comment on  
&gt; the separation between our planes of reality.
