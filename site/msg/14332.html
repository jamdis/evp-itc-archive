I like graveyards..thats the geneaologist in me. I could spend all day i=
n one taking photos and trying to figure out the family relationships and t=
he relationships of the names to local history...I haven't done much invest=
igating in them, but I was once called to investigate some activity at a ce=
metery - I was called by the caretaker.
 
I have run boxes and held evp ses=
sions in cmeteries, parks, my backyard, places that are reputedly haunted, =
places that are not supposed to be haunted and it seems to not matter - I h=
ave gotten evps and rtsc at all of the types of places - it doesnt seem to =
matter whether the  place is haunted or not. I will say that the best and c=
learest communications I have in my collection are from haunted locations -=
  Fort Mifflin and a haunted apartment building. 
 
Now, if a place is "hau=
nted" by a specific personality, the spirit is already there in the place (=
theoretically), so  when you begin your session (evp or itc) your chances o=
f talking to that particular spirit should be better, but this isn't always=
 the case - the only thing I can say after the year of ITC sessions I have =
done is that it does seem to me like there is some component missing from t=
he equation that might give us, the operator, better control and I am not s=
ure what it is, but I have had several dreams about itc lately and they wer=
e directing me to introduce colors and tones.
