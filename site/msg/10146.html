<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Stefan, yes, I agree.  

I should clarify.  Some skeptics/critics never intend to 
believe...their mind is made up.  That&#x27;s who I avoid.  Now a skeptic or 
critic who is at least open to the possibility of communication from 
the other side, I will point them in a direction to seek answers within 
for themselves.  :)

&gt; Hi LC,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; There will always be skeptics and critics, but one thing seems
&gt; &gt; certain: everyone has their own time when they become open to the 
&gt; &gt; possibility of the paranormal/spiritual existing.  I just choose to 
&gt; &gt; share with those whose time has come.  :)
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t see an skeptical/critical attitude as something negative.
&gt; Some people just aren&#x27;t &quot;believers&quot;, their intellect wants to be
&gt; satisfied, too. :)
&gt; 
&gt; So being skeptical/critical doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean not being a
&gt; &quot;seeker&quot;.
&gt;
