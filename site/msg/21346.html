<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty sick, but if you want to take into consideration all the imperialistic havoc that the United States has orchestrated and wreaked worldwide, while its citizens have sat around with their fingers up their a** watching sports... I&#x27;m surprised God hasn&#x27;t gotten the United States yet in Japanese proportions.  You want to get even more religious.... &quot;you are all sinners&quot;  that statement says it all...  We are each partly responsible for the ignorance we perpetuate in the world, either through our actions, or inactions.
And yes, the Chinese are pretty sick as far animal slaughter.... they skin animals alive for fur... but guess who buys the fur?  Probably a westerner....
