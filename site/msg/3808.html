<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, that was exactly what I was attempting to do. I don&#x27;t think it  
worked, sadly.

&gt; &gt; Okay, okay. I admit it, just trying to stir the pot, but I guess it
&gt; boiled over! But it did get me more info.

&gt; Let&#x27;s not twist words here. Show me where Chris has said you &quot;only&quot;&gt;
&gt; get false communication or bad guys. &gt; BTW I thought we were trying to
&gt; get the negativity behind us and move&gt; on to constructive discussion.
&gt; Guess that&#x27;s more of the wishy-washy&gt; depends on what my hair feels
&gt; like doing ways here. from his own blog (clipped, but not otherwise
&gt; altered):&quot;Wednesday, November 28, 2007The Box has hit the fan!Current
&gt; mood: distressed&quot;I have recentlybeen made aware that there are several
&gt; replica versions of thisdevice being sold. I have also been told of
&gt; another device that canbe purchased for very little from any
&gt; electronics merchant andaltered by hand, producing what some consider
&gt; to be results. As Iexpected, the samples that people have sent me are
&gt; *nothing morethan timed radio scans that have no validity.* [emphasis
&gt; mine]&quot;These new &quot;radio scanners&quot; are not only *a waste of money*
&gt; forpeople looking to do research with them in hopes of havingeffective
&gt; communication with the other side, but may in fact be *verydangerous*.
&gt; Should demonic and other negative entities learn to usethese
&gt; falsedevices, *the results could be devastating.*&quot;...The Catholic
&gt; Church ... predicted the widespread sale of*false communication
&gt; devices* as far back as last year. *I have recentlybegun to receive
&gt; requests from individuals asking for help to closenegative doorways
&gt; and portals that they believe they opened usingtheir purchased
&gt; Telephone to the Dead replica*. Others are claiming&gt; that I am a fraud
&gt; because their purchased device doesn&#x27;t producethe positive results I
&gt; have been fortunate enough to have.&quot;So let&#x27;s go throug this
&gt; again:*nothing more than timed radio scans that have no validity.**a
&gt; waste of money**very dangerous**the results could be
&gt; devastating.**false communication devices**I have recently begun to
&gt; receive requests from individuals asking forhelp to close negative
&gt; doorways and portals that they believe theyopened using their
&gt; purchased Telephone to the Dead replica.*As you see, there are two
&gt; statements that Chris is making--so much forhe&#x27;s always consistant,
&gt; which I believe was an earlier statement thatyou made.1. The new boxes
&gt; create accidental timed radio scans only.2. The new boxes are very
&gt; dangerous because they draw negative results.I&#x27;m not sure how the two
&gt; statements can stand together, but in eithercase, his opinion is
&gt; clearly not complimentary toward the rest of thebox users besides the
&gt; four of the 30 he says, in the same post, &quot;havebeen identified.&quot;Rather
&gt; cheeky and insulting and wrong, HMO. But if he just goes ondoing
&gt; sessions like the one APSR recorded, I will continue to laud them.Ann
