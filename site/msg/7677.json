You might have to make sure the voltage levels are \ncompatible. I made an RNG using white noise, and a discrete \ntransistor schmitt trigger.

I am also going to try the white noise via a a to d\n&gt; converter.  If the clock pulse is fast enough the white noise should\n&gt; be close to true random even after an a to d converter.\n&gt; Rob.\n&gt; Dead Science.\n&gt; - In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  My Speakjet test board, using a zif (zero insertion force) \nsocket,\n&gt; jumpers for various modes, and audio amplifiers. I&#39;m thinking use \nthe\n&gt; buffer full line to gate random numbers in from a white noise RNG on\n&gt; the serial line(?). I haven&#39;t read enough of the manual yet about \nthe\n&gt; data, if it needs to be in a certain form or what. Is it just bits, \nor\n&gt; is it bytes?
