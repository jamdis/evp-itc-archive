<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>DOH!! Found the still images.  I was looking at the folder in the lower right on the photos page.  Then I noticed the Georgia one.  Pete, the driver, and the symbols are clearest to me.

&gt; Its kind of hard to see anything in an uploaded video, Bill. If you have Skype I can send you the original file. That way you can go through it frame by frame as is required for seeing the images. There is still a lot of images I haven&#x27;t pulled as of yet in there. My user name on Skype is:
