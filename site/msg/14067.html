Hi Dave - This sounds really good.  I'm very intrigued by this approach and
look forward to hearing more from you.  Do you have a video on Youtube of
the setup?

Hi Margaret, Misty & all,
The manual radio sweep can produce some very clear messages. A few tips I
have found over the years. My best results were using a radio or stereo that
had very good quality of sound reproduction, typically with a large speaker
(over 6') or even larger external speakers. The ambiance of the room also
helps, try to record in a room with some space. Distance the recorder from
the sound source as far as practical. Don't overpower the recorder with loud
sound, experiment with different sound levels. Keep everyone else in the
house quiet during your sessions, easier said then done :). 

Currently I have been experimenting with light and sweeping heterodyne
sound. The method is much like a manual radio sweep except there is no radio
signals. The sweep 'noises' are some how transformed to words we can hear.
This currenty requires a large tabletop full of test equipment to work. If I
can get the voices clearer I will attempt to downsize the method to
something the size of a table radio.
Here is an example I'm attaching from a test session yesterday. I was about
to shut down the session. The second voice is my own.
Voice: "We're talking on the tape"
Dave: "Thank you for testing with us good-bye" 

They always refer to the recording process as "tape", even though we have
moved on in technology.
Thanks for listening,
Retro-Dave

Indeed, it was at Dave's suggestion to try this method that I became of fan
of manual radio sweep (though I think it had been around for ages prior to
that, I'd never heard of it.) I find Dave's experiments to be endlessly
fascinating. Surely seems he got a double-dose, or more, of innate smartness
and creativity. ;-)

Just add batteries and you're good to go. Oh, and an external speaker too.
