I am very happy I found this site.\nI&#39;ve been interested in what we now call the Paranormal since about the age of five. (1947)...by the way Roswell wasn&#39;t the only event that year. My own experience just didn&#39;t make national news.\n\nI am a retired electronic tech / photographer.  Sadly my eyesight and arthritis do not permit my building devices myself any longer.\n\nI am here to learn and visit with folks who share the interest in paranormal.\n\nI invite anyone who cares to communicate with me to do so. I&#39;d welcome contact with a builder or seller, what ever the rules of this site permit.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you:\n\nRon H"}
