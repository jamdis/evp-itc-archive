<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, that much was a bit of an exageration, the experts don&#x27;t actually say
ghost don&#x27;t cuss, it&#x27;s just implied, asn they know better.

 It&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t have anything else&#x27; I&#x27;ve gotten the crap about
unbiased listeners and somehow more qualified listeners, before. As sual,
completely ignore all the users out there do hear this stuff, and do get
verifiable information, time and again through EVP.

&quot;We are pretty sure that, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the voice is
formed in the electronics by transforming available audio-frequency noise in
an active part of the electronics such as a transistor junction.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Same old skeptic BS, ignore all facts and test nothing. I&#x27;ve said this
several times that the sound is manipulated inside the electronics, same as
this bozo claims old style EVP is made. You don&#x27;t need any external sound,
just connect the recorder to the headphone jack and record, and you still
get meaningful messages. Always, these dorks place limitation on spirit, as
if spirit is just a deminished sub-human. Ignore the fact that people get
images via computer, TV, open air, messages on printers not even connected
to a compter and telephones. Completely ignore EVPmaker, as the voices form
completely inside the computer.
