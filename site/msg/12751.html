Frank, what you are doing with the box=
es is interesting. I think the draw to the box for ghost hunters is that it=
 "appears" to be a communication device with the dead. I've been experiment=
ing a lot with the radio shack hack box and I have been getting a lot. For =
the most part I am using it to get answers to questions I or others have in=
 areas that have had strange events or just a paranormal nature to them. Th=
ere is definitely communication at a rudimentary level although I doubt tha=
t all of it is=A0honest communication. I definitely see a lot of the tricks=
ter influence with these boxes. It can and does tell people what they want =
to hear, and it seems to be reading the minds of the participants. Like som=
eone will crack a joke and the box will respond 2 seconds later saying simp=
ly "joke". I was using the box in one area with a recently married woman an=
d the word pregnant came=A0out of the box=A03 times during the 2 sessions. =
I think the box was picking up on
 her conscious or subconscious thoughts. =
I have not gotten the word pregnant since then. 
=A0
So far both radio shac=
k types I have are working spectacularly for me. One of the more interestin=
g responses I've gotten out of the box is that it has said "ovulous" backwa=
rds (it said "75" forwards), and that was just 10 minutes or so after I was=
 playing around with the Ovilus. I don't know exactly how The Ovilus is sup=
posed to be pronounced but the box pronounced it like I spelled it above.
=
=A0
So what is going on with these boxes is extremely interesting and not r=
eadily explainable by science, but I lean away from thinking the communicat=
ions are coming from ghosts or demons, I am thinking it is just transferrin=
g thought into messages or it is higher beings answering our questions (alt=
hough not always truthfully). I have to say I was highly skeptical that I w=
ould get anything with these type of boxes but I have been fascinated by th=
e results. I've played what I am hearing for others and have done sessions =
with others, and these people have all been impressed too. Thanks for bring=
ing this technology to the forefront like you have.
