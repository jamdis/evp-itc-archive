I couldn&#39;t make out a thing he was claiming was coming\nthrough, and it sounded a lot like a one sided conversation of Chris\ntalking to distortion and static.  I&#39;m usually pretty forgiving with\nsound quality, since being a musician as well I usually hear tones and\nsuch the average person doesn&#39;t.  But honestly, it was nowhere near\nthe quality or clarity of the recordings shared here on a regular basis.\n\nWould you say that&#39;s a problem unique to that specific box?  Since he\ngot it from you, and I know you tested it before you donated it to\nhim, do you think something happened to it since then to cause these\ntypes of results?  \n\n\n\nMarty"}
