<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have always used this Sony Walkman the past several years to bring 
to the ball game with me and it&#x27;s by far the best sounding radio i&#x27;ve 
ever had.  Well, i was cleaning up today and came across it.  I 
turned it on and just held down the scan button and it scans through 
all the stations non-stop as long as you keep it pressed down.  Which 
is no big deal since the recorded sessions for me are only usually 10 
Min. tops. This model has been out for years and you can pick it up 
at your local Circuit city or Best buy, it&#x27;s even on Ebay for $20.  
Circuit city i think is like $30.  You have to plug headphones into 
it or an external speaker, but it fits in the palm of your hand and 
the reception is better than all the rest.  It runs off of 1 AAA 
battery and lasts forever.  For those who are afraid to hack a radio, 
just pick this model up and hold the scan button down and away you go 
right out of the packaging.  I did open it up and there is a ribbon, 
but nothing was clearly marked so i will have to find the schematics 
online before i mess with it.  The radio has AM/FM/WB/TV, however 
when i did the trial scans i found that the AM worked best and 
instantly received answers to my questions.  I turned it on and asked 
if this is working and loud and clear they said &quot;yes&quot;.  Oh, it&#x27;s 
model # SRF-M37V.

I&#x27;ll post more when the ideas hit me.
