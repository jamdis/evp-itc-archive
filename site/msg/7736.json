Mr 2008\nVon: purplespacefriend&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n\n&gt;  There is a way to add in the foundation sound in the electronics. In \n&gt; #4 I had a square wave generator with variable frequency, that sound \n&gt; was mixed in with the radio audio and seemed to produce \n&gt; louder/longer/clearer voices. I put this function in #24, and 24 \n&gt; works the best out of the systems that used the LA1816 chip for a \n&gt; radio. I don&#39;t get that much time to play actually use this stuff.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  A square wave is preferred because the output contains all \n&gt; harmonics. The circuits are simple, and can easily be made on \n&gt; breadboard, or perf board from Radio shack. The mixer is a very \n&gt; simple circuit as well, or sound mixers can be purchased. \n&gt; \n&gt;  It was with these boxes, and one that I had tried to use a shield on \n&gt; thre tuner module, creating RF interference, that produced the \n&gt; clearest, and longest messages. \n&gt; \n&gt;  I suggest people really interested in advancing the research go get \n&gt; a book on basic electronics instead of constantly trying to re-invent \n&gt; the wheel. I&#39;m not saying mechanical methods are a &quot;re-invention&quot;, \n&gt; you just have to have a way to interface it to spirit, and I think \n&gt; that takes electricity/electronics.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S"}
