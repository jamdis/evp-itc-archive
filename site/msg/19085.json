I initially found this box to be difficult to learn how to use it; I didn&#39;t find it user friendly but I am not a tech-noid either.\n\nSecond, I tried the FM sweep feature but it never swept fast enough to be a useable feature.\n\nThird, while I haven&#39;t used this box a lot, I have caught very few EVP&#39;s using this box and typically one word EVPs in general.\n\nAnd last, the box promotes real time evp&#39;s because you wear earbuds so can hear responses to your questions. The problem is you can&#39;t hear what is being said, you know you caught something but it is not loud enough to make out what is being said. This also happened with Ghost Lab, one of the newer ghost chasing TV programs; they caught the name of a private from the Civil War in Gettysburg but could not make out what he was saying until they downloaded it onto their computer and opened it with some type of audio program.\n\nIn spite of all of the above, I really think a person needs to try different types of boxes or recorders and find out what works best for you. I think the user has some input (whether it is a person&#39;s energy or vibes or connection or?) into how well something works. What may not work well for me, may work well for someone else and vice versa.\n\nHope this helps,\nCB\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Michael Ed &lt;f1cracker75@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ursula, I had asked about the Real Time EVP Recorder, and the subject moved to SB7.
