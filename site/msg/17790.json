If you have a single-sided board pattern, after\n&gt; you&#39;ve developed the photoresist (or ironed on the toner, if you do it that\n&gt; way) spray the other side of the board with spray paint and let dry. I like\n&gt; to use the clear coat paint but it doesn&#39;t really matter.\n&gt; \n&gt; After you&#39;ve etched one side, clean the paint and the photoresist off (clean\n&gt; both sides) with acetone, MEK, etc. Do this in a well-ventilated area! Then\n&gt; drill your holes.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are going to make a double-sided board, drill a few of the holes that\n&gt; have common pads on both sides to orient the pattern on the other side and\n&gt; repeat whatever method you use to put a resist on that side. After it&#39;s\n&gt; developed/ironed on, spray the already etched side with paint and etch the\n&gt; other side. Clean off the board and drill holes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Jan 16, 2010 at 2:40 AM, elmer kliewer &lt;\n&gt; cowboy_ridehard2003@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   hay thanks zack where do you fine that stuff.\n&gt; &gt;  what i have now is a two sided copper clad board (not sensitize)  will it\n&gt; &gt; work with that as well? Would hate to wast them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
