I know that I can I buy one of the standard boxes in various places or I could make one my self... if only I was suave enough to be able to fallow the directions.. unfortunately I have never really been a direction type of person.\nI have always been extra sensitive and very interested in EVP and the paranormal every since I was very little and when I heard of your boxes recently I became very excited and would love to buy one, can you point me in the right direction..\nThank you, Susan"}
