Thanks John - I think those are=A0 good ideas.=A0 The main thing I would ca=
ution about is cleaning up the audio, as that can not only make some things=
 clearer, but can also introduce artifacts that weren't in the original dat=
a, and so can skew the validity of the sample.=A0 But, if done, perhaps it =
would be good to introduce a version system as you suggested, and post both=
 the original and the modified (but requiring voting on the original first)=
.
