<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Very sage advice; thanks again Bruce!

P.S.  The Japanese has a word for this (which escapes me now); but it 
essentially means what you&#x27;ve just outlined: negativity begets more 
negativity; harmful entities feed on negative energies and thusly 
become more powerful.  Best not to give them the time of day.

&gt; Hi Ann,
&gt;  
&gt; The swearing you are referring to is caused by negative entities 
that
&gt; are coming through the box.
&gt;  
&gt; There are a couple of reasons why this occurs, If you do a session 
when you are not in the correct frame of mind
&gt; like being stressed out or having a disagreement with someone. 
Anything that causes you to have anxiety will
&gt; be a source of energy that empowers the negative entities and can 
lead to deeper problems if not put in check.
&gt;  
&gt; Another reason for negative communication is that your tech is not 
capable of blocking them or you do not have 
&gt; a permanent tech assigned.
&gt;  
&gt; My advice is to only do a session when you are in a somewhat decent 
mood, Also doing  a 
&gt; protection prayer and asking your tech to block any negativity or 
negative entity from communicating or coming
&gt; through the box is a MUST.
&gt;  
&gt; When you are doing a session do not take the continuous cursing 
lightly, that is a sign that negative spirits 
&gt; are dominating the communication. Immediately shut the box and end 
the session.
&gt;  
&gt; Keep in mind that sometimes your tech will use a curse word to get 
your attention when your mind wanders from the session
&gt; to give validation that the communication you are receiving is not 
just public radio chatter, in 99.9% of the incidents of
&gt; your tech or any other benign spirit cursing usually they only use 
one or two curse words tops.
&gt;  
&gt; It is not an ongoing curse fest. Also after more experience you 
will know by gut instinct what is negative.
&gt; The main point is, do not take any negative communication lightly. 
It is not a joke.
&gt;

&gt; Mini box. 
&gt; 
&gt; This was just one snippet of one session. I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot 
of swearing since then. I just laughed at them when I heard it anyway.
