Hello everyone! My name is Beth and I am new to this group! Thank you to th=
e
owners/moderators who approved my membership! I was looking for a group o=
f
paranormal investigators who enjoy talking about the paranormal as much a=
s I
do. My family and friends seem to be sick of me talking about it and
wh=
enever I mention something that I've captured I get the roll of the eyes.
L=
ol!=20

I've always been interested in ghost and ghost hunting. When I was little =
my
mother would tell me that she would always hear boxes being thrown aroun=
d in
the basement and thought it to be a ghost. She also said that she woul=
d hear
footsteps and feet being dragged across the long plastic runner that=
 we had
in front of the basement door. She would get up thinking it was one=
 of us
kids and we would be sound asleep. So, naturally my interest grew. I=
 never
seen anything unusual but I would always 'feel' something in that ho=
use.
When I got older, married, and had my own kids I lived in a questionab=
le
house for 11 years. We would hear footsteps in the attic, the kids would=

complain of seeing 'uncle Sam' standing in the bathroom doorway, or a man
=
walking through the bedroom. Of course I never believed them. I asked my so=
n
when he got older and he remembered the man in great detail. Turns out it=

was a man/spirit in period clothing with a long white beard and top hat.
H=
ence the 'uncle Sam' character. I have seen a female child apparition
stand=
ing in the doorway to which I had a witness, my sister-in-law who saw
the s=
ame thing at the same time. We thought it was one of our kids and
quickly c=
ounted heads and it wasn't one of our own. The apparition vanished
and we n=
ever saw it again. I have heard music playing in the basement and a
man cou=
ghing when I've been home alone. A roommate of mine had her shirt
tugged on=
 and she thought it was me but I wasn't home from work yet. She
locked hers=
elf in her room, scared to death until I came home. The stories
go on and o=
n.=20

I moved from that home and now I am having strange things occur in this
ho=
use. I should note that I am over a thousand miles from my previous 
haunte=
d' home. I've lived here 4 yrs and one day I seen a little ball of
light (O=
RB) shoot out of my bedroom and go into my husband's chair. I have
seen a f=
ew shadows and have felt that creepy feeling where my hair stands on
end ma=
ny times. So, I decided to get a digital recorder. Not thinking that I
woul=
d ever capture anything. I also wanted to use it to debunk EVPs and find
so=
me Scientific explanation for them. I was wrong. I captured my first EVP
in=
 the master bedroom of my home. It said, "I have no love". Ok, that got my
=
attention. I tried to debunk it and could not. I decided to perform many EV=
P
sessions in my bedroom and have caught a lot of them. I have asked questi=
ons
and ask to knock for yes to certain questions. By doing so I figured ou=
t
that it was a Hispanic woman who had been murdered. After some research I=

have since found out that yes someone had died in this house. One of the
p=
revious tenants claimed there was a ghost here and even went so far as to
g=
et the house cleansed. I must have brought it back by summoning it while
co=
nducting my EVP sessions.=20

My fascination grew now that I was actually capturing real evidence. I hav=
e
since went on tours of supposedly haunted places such as: Vulture Mine,
A=
rizona, The Bird Cage Theatre Tombstone, Arizona, the San Carlos Hotel,
Pho=
enix, and Goldfield Ghost Town, Arizona. I am new at this so I haven't
been=
 on any investigations on a team. I do it alone. The only equipment that
I'=
ve been using is a digital camera and recorder. My main interest is
capturi=
ng something paranormal on film or EVPs.=20

I have recently made a couple of trips to a local cemetery, during the day=
,
middle of the afternoon and have caught amazing EVPs. I have captured man=
y
different voices and personalities. Some nice, some not so nice. Some wom=
en,
men, and children. It amazes me because I cannot debunk them. I know fo=
r a
fact that I'm the only one there so they can't be explained. I know it =
wasn
t me who I was hearing, so who is it? I'm not sure if ghosts really ex=
ist or
if they are all residual energy. Since capturing the voices actually=

answering my questions I am leaning toward that they really exist. There's=

just no denying. I now believe that some are residual and some are
intelli=
gent spirits. I enjoy EVPs because they are much harder to debunk.
With pho=
tographs there is always that 'what if' or well it could be a glare
or a gl=
itch in the camera. But with EVPs they are unmistakable.=20

I'm looking forward with getting to know everyone and sharing my experienc=
es
=20
