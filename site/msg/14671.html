Hi All,

Is there someone here that can answer and electrical question for =
me?

During the case that I recorded those possible EVP's-there was a loud =
tapping noise that seemed to come from the 2nd bedroom. Upon checking my lo=
gs, every time one of  these clicks were heard, there would be an EMF spike=
 in the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livingroom downstairs.=
 The home owners have also reported that they have a touch lamp that comes =
on all the time by itself and the lights in the Kitchen will dim occasional=
ly.

Now these taps are not consistent in timing, loudness or rhythm. Could=
 this be the work of faulty breakers?

Thanks!
April
