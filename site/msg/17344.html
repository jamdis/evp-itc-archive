<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve never posted an EVP but I do like to read about everyone else. Am I OK?

&gt; Same here - I have said  (several  times before) that since I have no
&gt; results I consider can only be explained paranormally, I have not posted
&gt; them.  As soon as I  get those, I will post them.  But I don&#x27;t see the point
&gt; of me just posting stuff to say &#x27;me too!&#x27;, or to follow the crowd, or to try
&gt; to fit in.  I am not disparaging those who have those results, and do post
&gt; them.  And since this is a discussion,group, it seems we should be able to
&gt; discuss them, and question, and make suggestions.
&gt;
&gt; Civilly.
&gt;
&gt; Also, Misty, there is more to &#x27;research&#x27; than everybody doing and saying
&gt; the same thing.  Even in what might seem a well-scoped area of study, people
&gt; can be at different levels of knowledge, or interest, or focus.  Some people
&gt; here are interested mostly in the hardware.  Some have no interest or talent
&gt; there, and focus on using the technology.  Some stand back some, looking at
&gt; process, controls, quality assurance.  Some may just be interested in the
&gt; psychic or paranormal components.  Some may be more interested in the &quot;Is
&gt; there anything there&quot; question.  Some, &quot;I know something&#x27;s there, but what
&gt; is it?&quot;.  Some &quot;I know there are ghosts there, what do they want?&quot;.  Some,
&gt; &quot;I know what they want, how can I help?&quot;.  And so on.
&gt;
&gt; One person giving their perspective, in a different focus, or a different
&gt; opinion, is not, &quot;crap&quot;, or &quot;wasting time&quot;.   It should be seen as healthy,
&gt; helping a science stretch and check, redirect or confirm,  grow and
&gt; explore.  To swat that down is a source of the negativity.  And if you are
&gt; concerned about negative comments, go back and read the threads, and see who
&gt; is actually making the insults.
&gt;
&gt; But, to make what I consider a positive suggestion, I would suggest people
&gt; stop insulting others with different opinions, and allow civil discussion,
&gt; and consider that none of us knows it all, and can still learn things from
&gt; others.  In fact, I hope that is the real purpose of the group.

&gt; Mind you, it hasn&#x27;t been too many, because I don&#x27;t get many EVP&#x27;s that I
&gt; deem worthy enough to put up as evidence.
&gt;
&gt; My sole purpose with this whole volley this last few days was to try and
&gt; convince Frank that I am not picking on him or his research by being
&gt; skeptical. If I where just here to tear him apart, I would be commenting on
&gt; everything he posts.

&gt;&gt; Who are you referring to? I have shared a few EVP&#x27;s with this group asking
&gt;&gt; what they hear. I do this every time I get an EVP. I post them to all my
&gt;&gt; groups, not just this one.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You know its kind of humorous for me that those who have the desire to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;discuss&quot; thier different views are often the ones who do the least amount
&gt;&gt;&gt; of actual research... as long as you have been in this group not once have
&gt;&gt;&gt; you shared one evp. If you did then please refresh my memory. This seems to
&gt;&gt;&gt; more about commenting on what others share for you than it is about doing
&gt;&gt;&gt; any research yourself. Im not sure what you are looking for, if you are here
&gt;&gt;&gt; to learn, correspond, or if you are just here to get a rise out of others
&gt;&gt;&gt; but to be honest I do not have time for it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Whether Frank bans anyone or not is up to him entirely. But I have warned
&gt;&gt;&gt; you before and I am saying it again. Cut the crap and move on. That goes for
&gt;&gt;&gt; ALL of you. I dont mind discussions, I dont mind differences of opinion but
&gt;&gt;&gt; I do mind BS.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have research to share then do so, if your research yeilds no
&gt;&gt;&gt; results then state it as such. If your only purpose for being in this group
&gt;&gt;&gt; is to question others, disect them, and cause negative discussions then
&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps you are wasting your time here. You are definitely wasting mine.
