<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ron,

I do have someone close to me on the other side names Helen who I  
have been asking after. Perhaps you can ask if this Helen is for me.

&gt; I am posting two short sessions for hopefully others to comment  
&gt; on.  This is completed with a RS 469 going directly into my  
&gt; handheld digital recorder.  Coincidentally, I am outside in a light  
&gt; rain so maybe it is ideal for me here in Mexico where I get few  
&gt; signals.
&gt; At first I thought I heard the word BUENO (hello in Spanish) but I  
&gt; now hear DINO with is my wife&#x27;s name...short for Dinorah.  She is  
&gt; normally not with me for sessions and was not with me for this  
&gt; session so I doubt what I am hearing.  Any comments would be  
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; The other recording I hear the name HELEN.  I don&#x27;t know anyone  
&gt; with that name.  Ron L
