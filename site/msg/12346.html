<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Suzanne,

The Ovilus and Frank&#x27;s Box are two completely different animals, so-
to-speak.
One is a series of circuits that cause a radio frequency to sweep 
using a method of &quot;white noise&quot; to stimulate that sweep pattern, 
while the other is a series of digital circuits using a number of 
sensors(I&#x27;m guessing)to stimulate speech and cascading LEDs to 
perform based on what mode it&#x27;s in.

My box was thrown together as a vacation hobby, with more added as I 
found more room to add... and as I found interesting devices on 
paranormal websites.
I did scribble some schematics down as I went, and I guess I should 
try to gather those up and put together some sort of diagram.

Let me work on that... in my spare time. :-)
When I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;ll make sure to put it on my website, and notify 
everyone here.

Have a super-natural paranormal day!

&gt; Interesting . . . I have often wondered if the Ovilus creator uses 
a similar design comparible to Frank&#x27;s Box. Are schematics available 
for the box you&#x27;ve created Mike? My team is very interested in not 
just obtaining an Ovilus but understand the technology behind it.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Interesting. .. so this device senses changing temperatures, etc 
and 
&gt; begins speaking differents words or phrases with these changes?
&gt; 
&gt; Humm... that 8-in-one paranormal box I put together a while back 
&gt; senses many different things also, but I never thought about 
putting 
&gt; those sensor inputs into a chip that speaks. I now uses meters and 
&gt; lights, and alarms when the thing senses different things. But I&#x27;m 
&gt; guessing I can tap into the circuits and pick a place where the 
&gt; different voltages (ever changing) are and put those into the input 
&gt; of a speaking chip.
&gt; 
&gt; Humm... I may just have to open it up again and see what I can do...

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks for letting me know. Am I right that the puck list is the 
&gt; same
&gt; &gt; as the Ovilus word list?

&gt; &gt; &gt; My team has not yet purchased the Ovilus but I have been told 
that
&gt; &gt; it has the ability to form words that have not been programmed 
into
&gt; &gt; it. Since I have never used one, I am wondering what are the
&gt; &gt; similarities between the Ovilus and Frank&#x27;s Box. Could it be at 
all
&gt; &gt; possible that rather than just forming words or sounds based on
&gt; &gt; atmospheric readings, spirits are speaking through the Ovilus as 
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; do Frank&#x27;s box? 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t mean to sound silly or presumptous, but I am very very
&gt; &gt; curious!! I am looking forward to purchasing the Ovilus as well 
as
&gt; &gt; the puck in the near future! Thanks for any feedback onthe 
Ovilus!
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The Ovilus has the ability to form words in the phonetic mode, 
&gt; which I
&gt; &gt; was not using. Does it have the ability to form words in the
&gt; &gt; dictionary mode? I do not know. It would seem unlikely. Can 
spirits
&gt; &gt; speak through the Ovilus like they do Frank&#x27;s box? Maybe. Frank&#x27;s 
&gt; box
&gt; &gt; has a lot of white noise that can possibly be manipulated by 
spirits
&gt; &gt; into giving us messages, but the ovilus has words programmed into 
&gt; it&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; memory, it would probably take a lot more for entities to inject a
&gt; &gt; word into the computer&#x27;s memory than to inject a word into white
&gt; &gt; noise. A lot of the words that are coming through that are not on 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; list is meaningless jibberish as the ovilus detects temperature
&gt; &gt; changes and has nothing to do with the paranormal. I do not 
believe
&gt; &gt; that the temperture changing could manipulate the components of 
this
&gt; &gt; device to the degree that would be needed to actually create words
&gt; &gt; like it is doing. I am betting if enough people catalog words 
that 
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; is saying we&#x27;ll probably wind up with another 500 or so beyond 
what 
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; was supposed to be capable of. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I emailed the creator yesterday offering to send him sound files 
of
&gt; &gt; the words I am getting so that he can properly identify which of 
the
&gt; &gt; 512 words these are, but so far I have not heard back from him in
&gt; &gt; regards to this.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a puck, and I have been getting the name Seth too. I also
&gt; &gt; have had
&gt; &gt; &gt; my puck give words that are not on the list.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Carol B.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new here, but have been into paranormal research for 6 
&gt; years now.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am the type of person that never gets EVP voices with a 
&gt; recorder so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I thought I would experiment with things like the Frank&#x27;s box 
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ovilus. I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a 
cemetery 
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field where a church burned down many years ago. I can not 
get 
&gt; too
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific without having people thinking I am making stuff up 
&gt; but it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of 
the 
&gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of 
&gt; random
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved 
over 
&gt; to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active 
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started saying relevant words like cross and priest. The 
Ovilus 
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MUCH more active when being used by our female member. 
Towards 
&gt; the end
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me 
told 
&gt; Seth
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that she did not want to talk to you I&#x27;ve heard bad things 
&gt; about you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she 
&gt; started
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head. 
&gt; Needless
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to say we ended the session and got out of there.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the course of our investigation we found that the Ovilus 
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so 
&gt; yesterday I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did some test recordings to see what words would come up and 
&gt; one of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the first things that came up was: seth blamed rest I am not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gare demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am 
&gt; not even
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the 
&gt; ovilus
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying this.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying 
&gt; aren&#x27;t on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the 
list, 
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Barry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words 
he 
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; getting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger 
list 
&gt; than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My most important question is is anyone else getting the name 
&gt; Seth out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?
