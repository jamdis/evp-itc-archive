<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m not in a position to be able to manufacture boxes, or produce 
them on demand. I have had very little luck with most that try to use 
these things. They don&#x27;t seem to work for everyone, although OI very 
much doubt that&#x27;s due to some limited access, more likely it&#x27;s the 
construction. 

 Everything you&#x27;ve seen and heard about the box is from one source, 
and I don&#x27;t consider that source accurate, nor representative of what 
everyone can expect.

&gt; Frank doesnt sell his boxes but there are plenty of alternatives 
out there. You can use manual sweep (free to try) or pick up one of 
the radio shack radios to modify so that it does a linear scan 
emulating some of Franks boxes. Those cost about 25 bucks and quite 
easy to follow the instructions. I just posted the links to Mikes 
videos on youtube about how to modify those. Check recent posts. For 
those to squeamish to follow the videos instructions, there is also 
other versions that have been produced that generally do same thing 
which are being sold like the minibox .
