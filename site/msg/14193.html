Yeah-I know about the file size comparison. Obviously if the file size beca=
me smaller, we know for sure there has been loss, except if the file had be=
en saved to a lossless compression type, such as from RAW to TIFF in photo =
files.

I just don't fully trust the bit comparison because I don't trust t=
hat the bytes haven't been resampled using interpolation, such as we discus=
sed earlier. But that is largely because I have no clue at that level of th=
ings what is actually going on.

All I know about this I know from Graphic =
Design experience and working with photo files, so I only have that knowled=
ge to use to compare. I no nothing about actual programming language, Unix,=
 or stuff like that.

        They are no=
t necessarily the same bytes, but I was proposing a quick check just to see=
 if the files were in the same ballpark.  Look at it the other way: if the =
number of bytes were DIFFERENT, than you'd know the files HAD changed, and =
you could stop testing.  But if the number of bytes are the same, it tends =
to indicate the files are likely the same, but you still need a low level f=
ile comparison to be sure.

        My method is to compare the files using=
 the CMP command in unix.  There are many programs to compare files, but yo=
u have to be careful not to use one that does a line-by-line compare (or a =
comparison meant for text files), since text files can be different at a lo=
w level, but look essential the same in an editor (because of the way space=
s and tabs and new lines work between editors and platforms).

        But =
anyway, the way to compare is with a program that can compare binary files,=
 not text files.

                  A file's content, it's integrity, is simply the bytes (=
and their bits) in the file.  If the file's content integrity is changed, t=
hat is, by definition, changing the bytes.  If the bytes in there are not c=
hanged, then that integrity has not changed.

                  It is possi=
ble to mess with other things about a file (like its name, its suffix, or i=
ts ownership) but this does not effect the contents, and so would not affec=
t that integrity, or the sound of the file (assuming you could read it at a=
ll after changing the ownership, or the suffix, etc).

                  Wh=
en you do your tests, if you cannot do a bit level comparison, I would reco=
mmend at least checking the file sizes.  If they are identical, there is a =
very high probability that the content has not changed.

    Admittedly I do not know much about bit-level comparisons, what they ca=

                    However, your a=

 Yes you can tell loss of quality by a bit-level comparison.  An audio file=
 is just a file of bytes, that is later interpreted by an audio player.  Tw=
o files with the exact same contents, whether they are audio or image or a =
dababase or an exe, are indistinguishable from each other.  That is, if I c=
opied the contents of one to a new file, and the contents of the other to a=
 new file, and asked you which file each came from, there would be no way t=
o tell.  Even the audio player could not tell.  The data is identical, and =
so the sound (or the picture, etc) would be identical.

                   =
         Yes I did listen to the results, but that is not the best test (th=
ey sounded identical, but that is a subjective opinion).  The real test is =
compring the contents.  Identical contents means indentical data, means ide=
ntical audio.

                            It is probably possible to set u=

         For executables, you may be right. However, for wav files, the com=
pression during email is not loss less. 

                                I=
 used to think as you do, in that the emailed attachment of a wav file woul=

 in very small segments, to keep file size down. This was just for ease of =
transfer. But because of this, I had not experienced any noticeable loss.

=
                                Now it may be in some cases, depending on t=

e less or more. But once the attachment is downloaded, the quality has been=
 found to be less then the original wav.

                                The kind of compression that occurs durin=
g an email attachment is "lossless": it compress the file cleverly without =
losing information.  For example, if I had a program in some .exe files, an=
d I sent it over email, it could compress it.  But if it lost even one bit,=
 the resulting exe file would not execute again after it was uncompressed o=
n the other side.

                                This kind of compression=
 does things like looking for common patterns in the file, and replacing th=
em with a token.  A rough example would be if it found "Howdy Neighbor" in =
a file 20 times, it could replace all the occurances with say $HN1.  And al=
so write a little dictionary in there someplace that says "$HN1=3DHowdy Nei=
ghbor".

                                When the file gets to its destinat=
ion it can be uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are replaced with "H=
owdy Neighbor".  So it was compressed (instead of 14 characters each, it on=
ly needed 4, plus the dictionary), but lost no data.

                     =
           Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not lossless.  Depending on=
 the level of compression, some level of data is lost, and so cannot be rec=
overed or reconstructed later.

  Another thing:

                                I recently found this out=
. When you email a file, if it is not saved as a compressed format, the ema=
il filtering process will actually compress the file automatically.

      =
                          So even if you have attached a wav. file, it will=
 loose resolution over the email process. It will not sound exactly the sam=
e as the original wav. file. How much it differs depends on the size of the=
 file you are attaching. If it is a very large file, it will sound much dif=
ferent.

                                The only exception to this is if t=
he wav. file is small enough that the filtering process will ignore it. It =
has to be pretty small though, like under 1 MB (I am not exactly sure of th=
e threshold).

                                The best way to share files =
over the internet if you want them as close to the original as possible is =
to upload them directly to a website.
