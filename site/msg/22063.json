AM is alittle screwy, and the boost function  would not work with\n&gt; a coil added to the antenna, I had to connect the boost amp to one of the\n&gt; antenna inputs to the tuner chip.\n&gt; \n&gt;  This was more digital tuner--the processor supplied digital numbers to an\n&gt; interpreter chip on the tuner board, and that chip conotrls the radio.
