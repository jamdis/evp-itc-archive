There is so\n&gt; much more than just listening to the files, you have too look. You\n&gt; have to train your eyes as well as your ears to make any sort of\n&gt; judgment. The second I load some of these files, before I listen, I\n&gt; see problems. I know the site isn&#39;t set up to really leave comments \non\n&gt; files with the file but something should be included in the name or\n&gt; something. Without it, it is not true representation of what the \nfile\n&gt; is or what has happened between the capture and the post. We listen\n&gt; and think &quot;Wow! Great catch&quot; but we really do not know. \n&gt; \n&gt; Are you starting the scan on your 3 469&#39;s at different frequencies?\n&gt; What is the ratio being mixed? Is it equal between the three? \n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that Mark and Debbie Constantino (sp)of Nevada use water\n&gt; almost exclusively for their recordings. I have found that method to\n&gt; be difficult in hearing the results. Are you feeling that those\n&gt; communications are from spirits or earthbounds and what makes you \nfeel\n&gt; that way?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve recently started analyzing a 40 min 469 session. The results \nare\n&gt; scary. I&#39;d say at this point, and I&#39;m only 1/2 way through, 90% of \nthe\n&gt; communication is negative in nature and mentions many supposed \nDemonic\n&gt; names. The layers of voices are, in many cases, multiple. Often, the\n&gt; listener hears very little of what is actually said. The voices can \nbe\n&gt; mocking or downright crude. I have not yet formed an opinion fully \nbut\n&gt; it would seem to me that these models are easy devices for lower \nlevel\n&gt; entities to figure out how to use. I can not speak of the attitudes \nor\n&gt; fears of those investigators present although at times, their voices\n&gt; are a bit shaky. \n&gt; \n&gt; Babs\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Very good observation Babs. Let me say that you have many friends\n&gt; and associates here just for the simple fact that you have an \ninterest\n&gt; in ITC, are a researcher and a complex thinker. I think we have \nshown\n&gt; in the past that we can have a disagreement and still remain \nfriends.\n&gt; You make a lot of good points in your post and I would like to know\n&gt; who removes time from their recordings. I have never removed time \nfrom\n&gt; my recordings and see no reason why anyone else would without saying\n&gt; so in an accompanied post.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have limited experience with the 12-469&#39;s as a single piece of\n&gt; equipment. I have arranged mine per Mike&#39;s, &quot;Spiricomp&quot; design. I \nhave\n&gt; 3, 12-469&#39;s feeding a four channel mixer, which goes into a laptop\n&gt; running DC6 with Soundsoap 2. Mine scan equally spaced on the FM \nband.\n&gt; I have had pretty good results until recently.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At first the messages were pretty clear but I had a feeling I was\n&gt; getting a different group than I normally have for the last few \nyears.\n&gt; When I would ask about my friends on the other side they would tell \nme\n&gt; they will look for them. Well about 2 weeks ago the 12-469 \narrangement\n&gt; started generating a lot of interference and feedback. I started\n&gt; hearing radio static voices as I use to get with shortwave. Not \nvoice\n&gt; fragments but voices made of static (metallic and robotic). They \nwere\n&gt; breaking through the sweeping. I had a feeling someone else was \ntrying\n&gt; to force their way through. Finally the interference got so bad I \nwas\n&gt; forced to revert back to a simpler method I used before, which is\n&gt; using fan noise. One of the first messages to come across was from a\n&gt; familiar voice telling me and I quote, &quot;your method sucks&quot;. I have \nnot\n&gt; used the 12-469&#39;s since because of the clear messages I have been\n&gt; getting using water and fan noise. That does not mean I have given \nup\n&gt; &gt;  on the 12-469&#39;s but I won&#39;t use them again until I am persuaded \nto\n&gt; by my friends on the otherside that they are willing to use and \nadapt\n&gt; to it. To my knowledge only Misty, Laura and myself use water for\n&gt; recording.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Frank R.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; &gt; From: babiarz3 &lt;babiarz3@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, January 21, 2008 9:34:01 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Babs has Issues!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt;             Alright, you all know I&#39;m vocal and I haven&#39;t made any\n&gt; &quot;friends&quot; here\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; but, if we can put that aside for a moment...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Spirit communication has been my passion since day one, a little \nover\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6 years ago. I am a believer in the afterlife and a believer in\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; spirits attempting to communicate with us for a variety of \nreasons. I\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; have spiritual beliefs that I feel strongly about and devote much \nof\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; my waking (and sleeping) moments to thoughts about this field.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, I am also a researcher and a skeptic. In order for me to\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; allow ideas to become part of my reality I must experiment. In \norder\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; for me to believe something is paranormal I HAVE to rule out all \nother\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; possible causes. That being said, I have some questions. My hope \nis\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; that there are some here willing to enter into discussion with me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a difficult time with many of the files here. Many times, \nthere\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; is no question included in the file. I can not determine whether \nor\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; not the &quot;reply&quot; is an intelligent reply. Maybe this has to do with\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; allowable file size.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some of the files I have been able to download. (I don&#39;t always \nkeep\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; my email settings on for this group as I get too many - lol) When \nI\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; look at the file I see problems. There will be complete flat line\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; silence between the words. Many times the &quot;reply&quot; is also at the \nsame\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; decibel as the question askers voice. Those two things should not\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; occur naturally considering the devices being used. That tells me \nthat\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; there is manipulation of the files. Now, what is manipulation to \nme,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; may not be manipulation to others. To me, any altering of the \nrecorded\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; file constitutes manipulation. I do not know if the reply was\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; intelligent or manipulated to be intelligent. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some say that they simply remove the &quot;no response&quot; time. I&#39;ve been\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; told it can be as much as 18 seconds removed from between words. \nNow\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; we run into the problem of us deciding what word fits in with the\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; question. What words are being ignored?  Did we take nonsense and \nmake\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; sense? Did we amp every noise/word or only what fit?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s great that files are offered for peer review. \nHowever, I\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; think we have to load them untouched or at the very least, offer\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; exactly what was done to the entire file. Time elapsed between \nwords,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; what was amped, etc. I&#39;d also love to see some of these sessions \nvideo\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; taped with the question asker facing the camera and a second hand\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; clock visible. Truly, we aren&#39;t researching if we don&#39;t have some\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; protocol in place.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here is an issue I have with the RS Hacks. I have the 469. It \ntakes\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; approximately 18 seconds to scan through the AM frequencies. Now, \nthe\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; typical person would think that we can take that 18 seconds and \ndivide\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; it by the number of AM stations to determine how long we are on \neach\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; station before moving on to the next one. In that way we could\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; determine what is impossible to be said via a radio fragment. \nHowever,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one frequency to \nthe\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; next and of course the biggest problem is that some stations are\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; picked up over multiple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard on 630, \n640,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 650, 660 and maybe even 670. That extends the time a great deal. \nThis\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; is a difficult problem because it is almost impossible for the \naverage\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; person to be able to make a determination on time this way. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I heard about the following today; An experimenter records at the \nsame\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; time every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importance of \nmeditating,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but what we \nhave to\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; remember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning into the \nsame\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; radio show every day. One of my first experiments with the 469 \nhad me\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; hearing this deep male voice over and over again. What was he \ntrying\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; to tell me, I wondered. Than I realized that he was speaking\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; approximately every 18 seconds; every time the scan hit that \nstation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, if you are removing up to 18 seconds between words, then you \nare\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; really only recording the words from one station. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides discussion\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; about some research problems. I know that there are those who are \nnot\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; concerned with anything more than the communication itself but I \nthink\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; that it is of the utmost importance to attempt to factor in some\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; protocol in order for this to be considered serious research at \nall. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;!--\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mkp{\n&gt; &gt; border:1px solid #d8d8d8;font-family:Arial;margin:14px\n&gt; 0px;padding:0px 14px;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mkp hr{\n&gt; &gt; border:1px solid #d8d8d8;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mkp #hd{\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; color:#628c2a;font-size:85%;font-weight:bold;line-\nheight:122%;margin:10px\n&gt; 0px;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mkp #ads{\n&gt; &gt; margin-bottom:10px;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mkp .ad{\n&gt; &gt; padding:0 0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mkp .ad a{\n&gt; &gt; color:#0000ff;text-decoration:none;}\n&gt; &gt; --&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;!--\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc{\n&gt; &gt; font-family:Arial;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc #hd{\n&gt; &gt; margin:10px 0px;font-weight:bold;font-size:78%;line-height:122%;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc .ad{\n&gt; &gt; margin-bottom:10px;padding:0 0;}\n&gt; &gt; --&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;!--\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mlmsg {font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean,\n&gt; sans-serif;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mlmsg table {font-size:inherit;font:100%;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mlmsg select, input, textarea {font:99% arial, helvetica,\n&gt; clean, sans-serif;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mlmsg pre, code {font:115% monospace;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mlmsg * {line-height:1.22em;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-text{\n&gt; &gt; font-family:Georgia;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-text p{\n&gt; &gt; margin:0 0 1em 0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-tpmsgs{\n&gt; &gt; font-family:Arial;\n&gt; &gt; clear:both;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vitnav{\n&gt; &gt; padding-top:10px;font-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;margin:0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vitnav a{\n&gt; &gt; padding:0 1px;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-actbar{\n&gt; &gt; clear:both;margin:25px\n&gt; 0;white-space:nowrap;color:#666;text-align:right;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-actbar .left{\n&gt; &gt; float:left;white-space:nowrap;}\n&gt; &gt; .bld{font-weight:bold;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-grft{\n&gt; &gt; font-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;padding:15px 0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-ft{\n&gt; &gt; font-family:verdana;font-size:77%;border-top:1px solid #666;\n&gt; &gt; padding:5px 0;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mlmsg #logo{\n&gt; &gt; padding-bottom:10px;}\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital{\n&gt; &gt; background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:2px 0 8px \n8px;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital #vithd{\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; font-size:77%;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;color:#333;text-\ntransform:uppercase;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital ul{\n&gt; &gt; padding:0;margin:2px 0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital ul li{\n&gt; &gt; list-style-type:none;clear:both;border:1px solid #e0ecee;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital ul li .ct{\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; font-weight:bold;color:#ff7900;float:right;width:2em;text-\nalign:right;padding-right:.5em;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital ul li .cat{\n&gt; &gt; font-weight:bold;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital a{\n&gt; &gt; text-decoration:none;}\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital a:hover{\n&gt; &gt; text-decoration:underline;}\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #hd{\n&gt; &gt; color:#999;font-size:77%;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov{\n&gt; &gt; padding:6px 13px;background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov ul{\n&gt; &gt; padding:0 0 0 8px;margin:0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov li{\n&gt; &gt; list-style-type:square;padding:6px 0;font-size:77%;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov li a{\n&gt; &gt; text-decoration:none;font-size:130%;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #nc{\n&gt; &gt; background-color:#eee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:0 8px;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad{\n&gt; &gt; padding:8px 0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad #hd1{\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#628c2a;font-\nsize:100%;line-height:122%;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad a{\n&gt; &gt; text-decoration:none;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad a:hover{\n&gt; &gt; text-decoration:underline;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad p{\n&gt; &gt; margin:0;}\n&gt; &gt; o{font-size:0;}\n&gt; &gt; .MsoNormal{\n&gt; &gt; margin:0 0 0 0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-text tt{\n&gt; &gt; font-size:120%;}\n&gt; &gt; blockquote{margin:0 0 0 4px;}\n&gt; &gt; .replbq{margin:4;}\n&gt; &gt; --&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;      \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n______________\n&gt; &gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and \n&gt; &gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
