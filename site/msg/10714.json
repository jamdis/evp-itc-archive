I&#39;ve been incognito for about 2 weeks now and did a quick\nsession this morning after a long absence because my sister wanted me\nto check on something.  Her lights have been flickering in her house\nand she thought it was her son Ryan.  She said it was just the lights\n- no other appliance was affected when they flickered.  She changed\nthe bulbs and it still occurred.  So I asked the box and I got some\ngood messages.\n\nI have wave cleaned them and slowed one down.  I know how some feel\nabout this but my reception sucks and it helps other people hear so I\nwent ahead and did it.  But I have the raw - untouched audio saved\nseparately.\n\n1)  Was Ryan messing with the lights:  YES HE DOES.  ITS HIM.  PLAYS\nWITH THE LIGHTS.\n\n2)  A message for his mom?\n     A)  HURRY UP BOY PLEASE.  I AM HERE.. HERE... DAD. (this one is\nrough.. sorry)\n     b)  RYAN (is) SOR... RY  ryan is   BETTER.\n     c)  YOU&#39;LL BE HAPPY AGAIN."}
