&gt; Good morning Frank,
&gt;  
&gt; I started my Sunday morning ritual off differently this morning by 
coming  
&gt; downstairs and getting coffer, firing up the laptop and having a 
smoke in the  
&gt; only place my wife will let me smoke in my house.  Boy it sure 
feels good  this 
&gt; morning.  And the first thing I do when I check my mail is check  
my mail and 
&gt; listen to your file.  I listen to all your files but I do not  
always 
&gt; respond.  I am always amazed at the communication you receive.
&gt;  
&gt; I was especially impressed about these files.  They were very 
clear  and made 
&gt; complete sentences.  The second file in the zip just blew me out  
of the 
&gt; water.  Especially after listening to it over and over again I 
was  astounded.  I 
&gt; especially liked the last word in the second file.  A  lot of us 
have received 
&gt; files with your name in it which is nothing new to any  of us.  
But for you 
&gt; to receive a file with my name in it.  It is the  last word said 
in the second 
&gt; file following the statements.  I just want to  thank you for 
putting that out 
&gt; there so that I could hear it.other people have  gotten my name 
before but 
&gt; that is only because they have asked direct questions  and my name 
has come up.  
&gt; In your file it was just stated.  And for  that I thank you.
&gt;  
&gt; Thank you again,
&gt;  
&gt; Jeff
