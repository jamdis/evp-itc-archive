  I know that makes ya happy Ann so Im happy for you.
   
  Til then you can give some of the other methods a shot. Sweep tuning is very "box" like tho I think Frank and I agree it often is much more flowing and produces some amazing results without being confined to a box. The effort on his part to incorporate it into the new boxes seems to be working out well.
   
  ST, h2o, music, box, silence... many methods we can go by, yet I tend to get some of the same voices coming thru no matter what I choose.
