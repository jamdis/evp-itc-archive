<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>At the end of Box 27-First Run, I hear &quot;C&#x27;mon Frank&quot;. I played it
several times, it is real clear to me. This is what I was reporting in
my earlier post on the site going back 6 months ago.

&gt;  On the longer video, (hopefully it uploaded) at 41 seconds you
should be able to hear &quot;hello Frank&quot; pretty clear.  @ 45 seconds &quot;that
danm sumption has a video--&quot;, @ 1:01 &quot;do a tape&quot;, @ 1:06 &quot;Bruce will
be double&quot;, @ 1:07 &quot;you are Frank&quot;, @ 1:18 my comments, @1:32 &quot;We
are(n&#x27;t) Taping here&quot;, @ 1:48 &quot;we&#x27;ll keep with Sumption&quot;, @1:55
&quot;Steve--Is Watching Video&quot;, @ 3:03 &quot;that&#x27;s one of the boxes&quot;, @ 3:30
&quot;vidoes of the speaker&quot; @ 4:46 &quot;look at the pretty woman&quot;. There&#x27;s
more, and a bunch of layering.  I don&#x27;t think the tuner is real
selctive, there&#x27;s only one IF filter on AM. FM operation is still
poor, but I&#x27;m still working on that.

&gt; I put videos on there were approved in about 2 hours. If you
addmetatag words of famous people or copyright song titles it takes 24
hours.--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@&gt;

notusre ifthe largest one went through, it&#x27;s only 6 minutes though.
thenanotheris aobut a minute, and the next about 20 seconds. I had
todomultiples cuz the random mode wouldn&#x27;t work for the first
run.thepurpose of the videos are to show the world waht the box
issupposedto soudn like. I ask them to say my name, and they may
