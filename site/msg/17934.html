Hi Frank, so you remember back last year in spring  of 2009 when that 
Chin=
ese student, Annie Le  who was going to be married  within the following  
=
week was murdered?  I was really new to this  but, from the first day she c=
ame 
up missing, and the police thought she would be  found ok, I did a ses=
sion 
on that first day, and I posted what I got on a couple  of lists.  I =
still 
have those files, and date on them on the pc here, I  played them to=
 police 
over the phone, and they took the report, in the end every  thing =
spirit said 
was true.  Everything, right down to the place they found  her=
 body, I think 
Bruce might recall this, it was his list I think where they=
  were posted, 
everyone was hoping she'd be ok, but as it turns out she wa=
s  killed, spirit 
said, "code blue", gave his occupation, "the tech" and h=
is full  name 
"Raymond Clark" and hers "Annie Le" they said "he buried her=
 body in the  wall" 
and that her body would be found.  The girl herself ev=
en came through  crying, 
and had an older Chinese woman (the accent) I can=
 locate these  files, if 
you like I will post them again.  I know this stu=
ff is true, I  let the 
police hear the files over the phone when they were=
 taking reports, the  files 
were clear enough, that the guy heard them, he=
 thought it was people in a  bar 
talking about the what happened, sf

Actually, it's more  interesting than that.  Not only do you =

what the 'spirits' say, you also don't control what  broadcas=

and to a large extent you don't  control what your brain fin=

I listened to these (try=

looks at the labels,  =
they prime their brains to interpret the sounds in 
YOUR way,  not their ow=
n way).  To me, they were either just a  mess of random 
radio snippets, ex=

twisting the radio =

In any case, I'd recommend a break: =

after  that.  But if you feel obses=

Well, got no response=

on these  lists can=
 hear these at all. They may be too  fast, but I did try 
to slow them a bi=

night in response=
 to Steve's letter about all the  "religious"  crap I've 
been sending,  su=

what spirit=

here that's=
 really funny, I think it  has a little demon on it too, he seems 
very ang=

saying=
, I think he is wanting to come after some  folks, because, even 
demon's b=

".....out,"=
  just going to let you hear it, may need to play it several  times to 
hea=

sa=
