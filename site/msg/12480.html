Will you guys STOP this arguing stuff.
The only man that I can see that I r=

obviously steve, y=
ou fail to remember when just a week ago i had to
apologize to you for aski=
ng you a question that i had no idea you and
the other person did not speak=
? i was only interested in the
technology and furthering itc research. but =
i guess that one question
came across too smug.

you said to black bear tha=
t he doesn't know you he dislikes you. I
don't think that is the case at al=
l. i still don't have a problem with
you either. all i ever wanted to do is=
 talk about the research you
were doing.

I now have 2 frank's boxes (the G=
HOSTMAN 3 and FB#33) to do my
research. (btw.. i thanks you a bunch already=
 frank.. so thank you again)

Steve, you come across as an expert is all i =
am saying. that is why i
contacted you. "boxmaster estraordinaire" is it? F=
or you to say "who
is this guy?" and cause problems for a mutual friend is =
absurd. so..
for you and everyone to know a little about me...

oct 22 i tu=
rn 33 years old. I have been interested in the box
technology for a few yea=
rs now. i have been doing paranormal
investigations for 19 years now and to=
ok a 3 year break (which is when
you popped up on the scene.) Now i'm back =
and hitting it hard again
and want to be able to use the best equipment tha=
t money can't buy.

Frank doesn't even pretend to be an expert nor does he =
expect his name
to be mentioned every time an article is published. anyways=
.. i
probably said more than i should have already.

bear... i'm up for tha=
t duel.. sounds fun...lol best one wins a
"certificate of expertification" =
sign by the us president...lol

btw.. one rule bear... no cutting and pasti=
ng clips together to make
one up. haha
