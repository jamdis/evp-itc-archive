&gt; to &quot;translate&quot; means to change, i looked up the word, as in a different language in order to understand a different language we must translate it, I&#x27;m really not sure what it means to happen, I think we just vanish on this side, and appear on their side, some how.  another dimension? maybe. sf

&gt; &gt; Ok, he says &quot;the world wide animal, birds, fish, bees, bats, ducks, crabs, 
&gt; &gt; cows,whales, dolphins, buffalo, etc...deaths are going to continue, it 
&gt; &gt; seems they will all return after about 2 or 3 years or so after the permanent 
&gt; &gt; return of Christ to this world, this will occur after the antichrist has 
&gt; &gt; all but destroyed all life, but JC will come back, and stop him.&quot; David says 
&gt; &gt; that &quot;the entire animal population may be nearly wiped out before Christ 
&gt; &gt; returns,&quot; things are going to only get worse,&quot; right now we are all living 
&gt; &gt; in this bubble, thinking it won&#x27;t happen.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s very sad, I still can&#x27;t get David to tell me who it is that killing 
&gt; &gt; the creatures, he only says they will all be brought back to earth after JC&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; return. So, stock up on canned food if you can guys, enough to last for 
&gt; &gt; at least a year or 2, I buy mine a few extra at a time, and if you are 
&gt; &gt; translated over, the food will be there for some one else that gets stuck here 
&gt; &gt; for that near 3 years. I keep hoping to win the lotto, like everyone else, 
&gt; &gt; then I would put lots of food in here for people so, they don&#x27;t starve. I 
&gt; &gt; have the lake down here, our water is from a natural artesian spring 
&gt; &gt; water, it is 250 feet deep so, it&#x27;s pretty safe to drink. And even if I lost 
&gt; &gt; electricity, one could always get some water, from the lake out there which 
&gt; &gt; is private too. If I leave, anyone stuck here is welcome to come over here 
&gt; &gt; to live, but you will need to probably keep up with the mortgage if there 
&gt; &gt; is still the bank left. Whatever, it&#x27;s going to be pretty bad from what I 
&gt; &gt; hear. sf
