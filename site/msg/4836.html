<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>A lot more clear, Frank.  If the voices come through as clear, it is 
a definite improvement.  Any messages coming through with the direct 
method?

&gt;  So did anyone get a chance to listen to the one I did the tone 
control test on? It&#x27;s an attempt at something like a clarifier 
control. It&#x27;s in my folder, under the files section, and the test is 
more toward the end of the segment.

&gt; Frank, I heard a few words hear and there but for the most part the 
noise over took everything. Bruce

&gt;  These are direct from the system output speaker, the speaker that 
will provide the raw audio output for this box. There seems to be 
more static on the AM band tonight, part of that is cuz I think this 
board has more RF gain at the antenna then the previous board. It 
probably depends on the type of core I used for the coil, and since 
they are from the junk box, I have no idea what the permeability 
rating is for these cores. The core being a ferrite bobbin that I 
wind the coil on.   Frank-S
