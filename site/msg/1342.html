Yeah I get it with most methods too. I questioned them on that and I was given a couple different responses. Think of it as a group effort, many minds coming together to convey the same thought/words. Sometimes you get the opposite effect where they speak over each other with entirely different words. They also said something about alternate realities echo. But thats too big for my tired brain to think about tonight so I will just attach a few echo topic files here and maybe some of you can hear what I hear and see what they have to say. =)

  PS If you dont see files attached then you dont have individual mail settings turned on for group.

I have gotten that echo wiht almost ever method, EVPmaker, and radio 
scanning methods, or my boxes, there's often a pre-echo, and post echo. I 
don't know what causes it.
