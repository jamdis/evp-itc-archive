I guess I had it turned around lol I was trying to get as little signal as possible.\n\nThanks Kristin, I&#39;ll definitely try that as the room I am in now gets absolutely none.\n\n\nShane\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristin Morris&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Shane. I definitely heard the HI in the beginning and the name I heard at\n&gt; the very end was maybe CARSON?  It sounds like you aren&#39;t picking up much of\n&gt; a signal.  Try walking around.  I have to do that and even go outside\n&gt; because my AM signal is really poor.  Walk around and ask them to tell you\n&gt; when to stop.  Believe me they will :-)  Great start!\n&gt; \n&gt; k\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt; Not given\n&gt; Sent: Friday, May 22, 2009 1:51 PM\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: What do you think?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Heh yep thanks April I got it right before you posted figured I&#39;d log out\n&gt; and try the link and it didn&#39;t work knew something was up then ...thank you\n&gt; though! \n&gt; \n&gt; Shane\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups &lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; .com, &quot;April\n&gt; Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shane,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I just started using esnips yesterday.
