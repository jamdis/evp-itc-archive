<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey, no, thank you for sharing, Mike.  I went out and bought the 
microphone you use, and what a difference it should make.  It powers 
up with a AAA, so it probably ups the amps(?) so I can get more out 
of it than the lapel amped mic.  I am going to run experiments 
tonight and will update.

The echo chamber as Frank used might slow the mix down a bit and make 
it better to discern - so I want to test this, too.

&gt; Hi LC,
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, the &quot;click&quot; can be cut down a bit by using a chamber.  It&#x27;s 
&gt; a &quot;phase&quot; thing.  When the &quot;click&quot; (or any sound wave) is reached 
at 
&gt; the input mic at 180 degrees out of phase with the original I 
&gt; understand there is a cancel effect.  That works with any sound 
wave I 
&gt; think, so you&#x27;re bound to have some &quot;clicks&quot; and their 180 out of 
phase 
&gt; wave reaching the mic nearly at the same time, cancelling somewhat.
&gt; There is so much bouncing going on in there I would love to see 
what 
&gt; the entire pattern looks lke on a scope.  There must be alot of 
phase 
&gt; shifting going on.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried my prototype with and without the chamber yesterday.  I 
found a 
&gt; BIG different, and I&#x27;m sticking with the chamber effect.  For one 
&gt; thing, it increased the amplification at least three-fold when I 
used 
&gt; the chamber, not to mention all the mixing and phasing.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope to play some of my box audio files tonight on my internet 
radio 
&gt; show. Both from my chamber system and from the three 12-469/mixer 
&gt; system.
&gt; 
&gt; Hey, LC... keep up the good work, and thanks for sharing!
&gt; 
&gt; - Mike

&gt; &gt; Thanks, Mike.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am still working on different set-ups in a sound chamber.  I 
&gt; &gt; realize the chamber is not necessary, but I think with the 12-
469, it 
&gt; &gt; helps to run it into a box to mix it, which helps remove 
the &quot;click&quot; 
&gt; &gt; noise received while it sweeps the AM band.  Also, I want to try 
&gt; &gt; bouncing down an echo chamber, so it slows the sound down a bit 
to 
&gt; &gt; possibly make it easier to hear. Still experimenting here.
