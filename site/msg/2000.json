As expected, there&#39;s a few things I needed to \n&gt; change\n&gt; on the layout, that&#39;s what the proto type boards are for. The blue jumper\n&gt; wires are #30 wire-wrap wire. I could get rid of the jumpers by going to 4\n&gt; layer boards, but that more than doubles the cost. This is both the linear\n&gt; and random sweep sections shown here.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; See what you&#39;re getting into.before you go there\n&gt; http://newlivehotmail.com/?ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_viral_preview_0507\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
