<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am happy to have a civil conversation with you (and I don&#x27;t know what all these other forums are you are talking about) but you need to do it in a civil and constructive way.  The forum rules say that if you are offending people or being obnoxious - and I think calling me a troll, and making up things about other forums, and hoping I will be banned, and telling me to WAKE UP, matches that pretty well - you will be banned.

So again, if you have something constructive to say in a civil way, we&#x27;re all ears.

&gt; RJ ... I&#x27;m not throwing a fit at all. I&#x27;m just pointing out a Troll when I
&gt; see one and you my friend are a TROLL.
&gt; No problem at all.  I mean it in the nicest way possible. I hope they will
&gt; throw you out ASAP as all the other forums have.
&gt; 
&gt; Have a great day. I can&#x27;t let you get away with implying Frank is a liar and
&gt; he must do as you say! It&#x27;s just hilarious!!!!

&gt; &gt; I didn&#x27;t twist dick! I said that&#x27;s what happens when I ask the box stupid
&gt; &gt; questions--I get stupid answers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And who the hell here is so perfect and so knowlegdable that they know what
&gt; &gt; questions to ask and what answers are valid?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This communcation mode is extremely experimental, nothing is known about
&gt; &gt; it, or who uses it on the oter side. All there is is abunch of wanna be and
&gt; &gt; self proclaimed experts that base everything they know on Ghost Busters and
&gt; &gt; Night of the Living dead! So bite me!

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you like to post some (future) predictions for this year with clear
&gt; &gt; dates and events, feel free.  If you have advice to Frank and others on how
&gt; &gt; to better interact with their voices and acquire clearer more understandable
&gt; &gt; messages, that would be useful.  And if you&#x27;d like to explain further how I
&gt; &gt; am &quot;wrong&quot; that the world did not end on August 15 as was predicted, please
&gt; &gt; do so. But throwing a little tantrum with no constructive criticism doesn&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; really allow much productive conversation, if I may say so.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Twisting a prediction after the fact to fit circumstances is one of the
&gt; &gt; biggest mistakes (or biggest cop-outs, or biggest lies) a would-be
&gt; &gt; future-teller makes.  The predictions you were touting were for August 15,
&gt; &gt; and included end-of-the-world warning..  Trying to say these were correct,
&gt; &gt; but not REALLY for August 15, and not REALLY end-of-the-world stuff, seems
&gt; &gt; like a way to save face, or keep hoping the messages are real, when in fact,
&gt; &gt; this is another example that they are not.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So from now on, you will no longer hear clear dates and predictions.  You
&gt; &gt; may hear vague dates and vague predictions if you like, but you will not
&gt; &gt; hear anything that can be confirmed.  Doing so would put you in a position
&gt; &gt; of having to question the verity of the EVP data you collect.  And that
&gt; &gt; might lead to abandoning this while area of study.  And we
&gt; &gt; &gt; know you cannot do that.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  Well, it seems the original prediction of the east coast getting
&gt; &gt; clobbered is probably correct. Where I fell down was trying to ask questions
&gt; &gt; and getting BS doomsville junk. I knew it&#x27;s a mistake to ask questions, that
&gt; &gt; like opens the door for the dark dorks. I&#x27;m going back to just announcing
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m doing an EVP recording, and just record. They know what I&#x27;m thinking and
&gt; &gt; what I need to know and who I would like to hear from. Asking questions, at
&gt; &gt; least for me, has always lead to problems. I&#x27;m not like others, presumming
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m so smart and know what is talking, and if it&#x27;s honest, like most of the
&gt; &gt; box experts out there on the web. You know, the ones doing pod casts, radio
&gt; &gt; shows and proclaiming this that and the other thing.
