I asked about the &#39;circle&#39;.  What i\nheard - and hopefully you hear - was ITS COMPLETE - DO IT.  I think I\nhear something that says EARTH and HIGHER.  It ends with THE SHIFTING\nand I think it says begun but it&#39;s really rough at the end.  I used a\ndenoiser as you will be able to tell.  Because I really needed to pull\nout what they said.\n\nI saved the original raw audio though.\n\nLet me know what you think.  Thanks,\nk"}
