Yes, maybe its as simple as ...
Listening = input
finger tuning = output
Therefore Automatic frequency (fragment selection) control created (with subconscious influence by entities).

&gt;  There&#x27;s different possibilities, I have one box with a crystal glued over the antenna that seems to work better in a kind of subjective way. Some hold the antenna to their chin (moon). Maybe just listening puts the person in the box?

&gt; &gt; Frank,
&gt; &gt; I was thinking about your comments..
&gt; &gt; Manual sweep does seem to add more of the operator into the process. Perhaps thats a good thing, as the tuning likely becomes under the control of the person&#x27;s subconscious much like a Ouija board and possibly allows entities to better manipulate the tuning of required fragments? 
&gt; &gt; Linear or random electronic tuning doesnt have that direct human interaction .... but can it be tied in somehow?

&gt; &gt; &gt;  See, not a box, or even a hack radio, just a cheap little FM radio. No magic, no mystery, but mucho fun! You can ask questions, and get all the box function--no box! I just can&#x27;t in all honesty sell something that&#x27;s just a damn radio with automated sweep. I mean i could probably sell it for what it is, but not for mega bucks, or try to over glorify it like all the wanna be box experts out there. It&#x27;s just one method of many of supplying raw audio. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  BTW, Misty pretty much discovered manual sweep here, on this group!
