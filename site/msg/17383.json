Umm... no. Chris Moon is the one who showed me how it really works, and I&#39;m grateful for that.  \n\nHowever, I&#39;m mostly enjoying this gorgeous holiday weekend, and I hope everyone else is having a fine May weekend, as well.\n\nCheerfully,\nFiona\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Yeah, I know.
