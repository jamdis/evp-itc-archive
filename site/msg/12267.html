<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Al,

- The results as written, were very good.  Actual conversations were 
documented, and even help provided on ways to better contact and 
interface with the spirits, given by the spirits themselves.

- I don&#x27;t know about specs on the Ion Lamp. I just wanted to try it 
since it is active light frequency that changes or is manipulated 
very easily.

- I&#x27;ll keep your ideas in mind when I do my next set.

- Thanks for the advice about finding mediums.  I know a few and will 
probably talk with them since I am already friends with each of them.

&gt; Mike,
&gt; What were the results of working the mediums? Anything significant? 
&gt; Kinda wish we both lived a bit closer, we might have been able to 
work together on some projects... :D  We live in Michigan.

Mike, Is there any research that says that an ion lamp is hyper 
sensitive? 

You might wish to hookup your EMF detectors in such a fashion that 
each one showing a response would be video taped. If one has a 
positive, then it might show up on your video.

Also, if you are interested in locating a medium, look in your local 
phone book for a local spiritualist church. They will have many 
mediums attending. Before you ask to test them, please, build up a 
friendship first. I was recently asked to be tested by some locals 
but their proposal was very poorly written and had no real tests or 
conclusions, per se. I turned them down.

&gt; Funny you should mention using a medium to communicate with this 
&gt; system. That dediated group in the 1960&#x27;s first used mediums in 
&gt; conjunction with their electronic equipment.
&gt; The mediums were used to relay the words or feelings they heard or 
&gt; felt from the spirits that were attracted to the different modes of 
&gt; frequencies that the experimentors.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m in Colorado Springs, Colorado; in the same neighborhood where 
&gt; Nikola Tesla did his experiments while in this city for about 6-8 
&gt; months. His lab was located about a 3 minute drive from my house.

&gt; &gt; Mike,
&gt; &gt; I have an idea for you to think about and possibly consider 
&gt; trying. mediums, as you know are about a dime per dozen these days. 
&gt; Have you considered video taping a medium before, during and after 
a 
&gt; reading was being done? 
&gt; &gt; Once while some of our smaller group in Muskegon, MI were out 
ghost 
&gt; hunting one afternoon, I sensed a spirit nearby and asked some of 
the 
&gt; members to use their EMF equipment to see if they could pickup 
&gt; anything. One guy had a positive reaction to a spirit that was 
&gt; standing in front of me. His EMF detector showed a few blips and 
then 
&gt; the spirit was gone. I was still communicating with the spirit 
after 
&gt; the blimps stopped. Might be worth trying as an experiment.
&gt; &gt; Mike, where are you located?

&gt; &gt; Hi Al,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; To answer your first question I provide this link:
&gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S-4e-wxd6U
&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s a video that better explains how I think it might work. 
(Just 
&gt; a 
&gt; &gt; couple of possibilites).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; To answer your second question... I have done three 
experimentation 
&gt; &gt; sessions so far, and the results differ. In one I got no 
response, 
&gt; &gt; and in the other two I did get action but I&#x27;m unsure on what 
caused 
&gt; &gt; it. I&#x27;m reviewing it further.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My use of the Ion lamp, which is away from the traditional &#x27;video-
&gt; &gt; loop&#x27; method is based on things I&#x27;ve read from those who were 
into 
&gt; &gt; this EVP/ITC thing way before us. Back in the 1960&#x27;s there was 
much 
&gt; &gt; experimentation going on that involved a varied range of 
&gt; frequencies, 
&gt; &gt; including light frequencies. Even house plants were considered 
into 
&gt; &gt; the EVP/ITC equation (Maybe I&#x27;ll try that next).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My use of the Ion lamp goes along with a continued desire to 
&gt; further 
&gt; &gt; the work of the dedicated group from the 1960&#x27;s... and continue 
to 
&gt; &gt; see if &#x27;other&#x27; ideas work.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; After all... sweeping radio signals, and snowy video pictures are 
&gt; &gt; only a couple of snippets of the frequencies available for 
&gt; &gt; experimentation. Even my limited idea of what the Ion lamp might 
do 
&gt; &gt; could be way off... but I have to try it. I might be surprised 
what 
&gt; &gt; it might be capable of. It might not only offer increased 
intensity 
&gt; &gt; and stimulation. Maybe it could even offer more than that.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ll keep trying new things... and I&#x27;ll make sure to share them 
&gt; with 
&gt; &gt; the group.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks for asking...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - Mike

&gt; &gt; &gt; An interesting setup, Mike...
&gt; &gt; &gt; I do have a question though.,..what is the ion lamp for? 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Have you had any success photographing any spirits?
