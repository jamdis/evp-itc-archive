What about other frequencies, e.g., walkie-talkie \nchannels (public, private and government), television broadcast \nchannels, and all the in-between frequencies?  In other words, while \nscanning, for example, an AM channel, would it not be possible for \nthe radio receiver to pick up another band, let&#39;s say, short-wave?  \nThe reason I&#39;m asking is that years ago I was dictating something \ninto the hand-held mic of a cheap cassette tape recorder and imagine \nmy surprise when in playing back what I&#39;ve just dictated, instead of \nhearing just my voice, I also heard in the background a two-way \nconversation between truckers using their CB radios that my cheap mic \nhad picked up while I was recording!\n\nMy point is even if we&#39;re scanning only certain frequencies, can&#39;t \nother frequencies bleed through and if so, perhaps this may be the \nreason for some of the non-sequitor responses picked by the boxes?\n\nAnother question:  Astronomers use scanning devices to pick up \nsignals from outer space -- are their receivors constructed on \nbasically the same principles as the radio receivers in the ITC \nboxes? \n\nThanks everyone,\n\nSharon the Ignorant"}
