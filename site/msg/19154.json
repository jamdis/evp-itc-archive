If I&#39;m sitting there with a plate of food, they have to land on\nit to find out what it is.\n\nHopefully when the cold sets in they will go into hiding.

If man thinks he is so advanced, how many can control eight\n&gt; legs and spin a web? How many eyes does a fly need if there is no intellect\n&gt; to process the information? Humans vastly underestimate the rest of nature.\n&gt; Human ego, unjustifiable.\n&gt;\n&gt;  These big radios make better boxes because the quality of the radio is\n&gt; better. Better front end, not so easlily overloaded by strong nearby\n&gt; signals, and better IF filter(the down conversion process), less surious\n&gt; signals, clearer sound. Larger audio amplifiers, and less distortion.\n&gt;\n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nThis is he ime o yea when my house ge s o e un wi h boxelde bugs.
