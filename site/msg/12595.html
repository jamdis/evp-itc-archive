Hello everyone. I am =
a member of your group, but also have my own
group consisting of people tha=
t work to assist law
enforcement/ missing person organizations using their =
radios or
psychic/medium skills.

I am looking for volunteers to record wit=
h deceased victims to try
and help solve cases managed by Nancy Angelbound.=


These are cold case files.

Anyone interested, please join my site and go=
 to the links page to
see the cases. http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ =
SDWR-
SpeakingToTheDeadWi thRadios/ ?yguid=3D338683728

We ask you send you=
r files to Nancy directly to ensure this
information does not leak into pub=
lic hands possibly causing harm to
the family or police investigation.

Nan=
cy Angelbound will work with you directly and she will get the
info you pro=
vide to proper authorities.

For your personal reward, you help the victim =
find closure, the
family find closure and law enforcement close the case.

=
Please accept my invitation to help those in need, and thanks in
advance.

=
Mike Edwards
