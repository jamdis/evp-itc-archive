<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Dont forget thermometers to check for &quot;cold spots&quot;---Are the spots actually &quot;Cold&quot; or are they making us FEEL cold?
Also a compass for magnetic fluctuations.
Some of those ultrasonic or IR motion detectors (real cheap at radio shack)
A hygrometer for measuring dewpoint( at what temp water in air will condense to form a mist---great for correlating with cold spots---mist apparations)
A K2 meter--only 50 bucks or so.  great for &quot;gross screening&quot; of the area
A natural EM trifield meter  a bit expensive($200-250) but standard ghost hunting equipment.

&gt; I love this discussion group.   There is so much information here it is hard to process all of it.  Currently, I am working on building a Frank&#x27;s box for my paranormal group, however, I am looking for some other home made type equipment to have for our investigation this next week.   We currently have IR cameras, EMF detectors, tons of audio recorders and many different cameras.  Is there anything else we should have or be using that anyone can think of??
