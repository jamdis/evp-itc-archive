Nick,
 
My advice as a long time researcher is not to just turn the box on=
 and leave it running 
unless you intend to do a session and give your frie=
nds on the other side that are working
extremely hard to send you the commu=
nication your undivided attention.
 
It's kind of like calling someone on t=
he phone and when they start a conversation you decide to
put the phone dow=
n and focus your attention on other things.
 
There are other researchers t=
hat feel that there is nothing wrong with this practice and do it on occasi=
on
But I have come to the understanding that it is deemed disrespectful and=
 while you may be listening with 
one ear as you do something else, you wil=
l hear a loud curse word or nasty statement, that is their way 
of getting =
your attention back. I have gotten numerous messages about the difficulty o=
f the attempts for 
them to communicate so when I turn the box on it gets m=
y full attention. just some experienced advice.
 
As for them telling you t=
o close the portal, it could have two meanings. Sometimes they refer to box=
 that
is turned on and in use as a portal for the simple reason that each t=
ime we turn a box on to communicate 
it opens a direct open link between ou=
r realm and theirs so in essence it is an open door for anything to pass in=
 or out.
 
that is why when I end a session I always ask my technician to b=
ring back any spirits that may have come through the 
portal during the ses=
sion and I ask for conformation and 10 times out of ten will get "OK" or "O=
K THEY ARE BACK"
 
also they may have meant since you had the box running a=
nd where not doing a actual session to shut the box so 
that they could go =
and not have to protect the open connection from any negative entities that=
 where able cross through the open
portal.
 
A few researchers have been re=
ceiving numerous messages about the number 7 within the past month. The onl=
y known 
significance that the number 7 has in evp research is the 7 entiti=
es that controlled communication back in the eighties and nineties
during t=
he spiricom and luxembourg era. To receive this number in messages so often=
 and by more than one researcher, odiously
holds some importance which they=
 have not been able or are not ready to convey.
 
If you need any help or h=
ave any questions please feel free to ask.

Hey,Anyone have any=
 odd problems in the morning with using it. I am sitting here checking my e=
mail so i just thought i'd turn it on and... not check my email. Anywho....=
 Then right at about 6:20 i heard a voice say "Nicholas Etheridge please tu=

just thought it was weird. Also under all of the jumble and this voice spea=
king i heard a deep male voice almost chanting "seven". Not sure if I actua=
lly heard this or its the want to have an excuse to stay home and not take =
the HSAs.Anyway.. just curious if anyone has gotten heard this or if they k=
now something I don't about using the box in the morning.Peace,Nick
