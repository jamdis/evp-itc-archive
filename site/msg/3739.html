<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank--I have listened to this APSR broadcast and was incredibly impressed with what occurred at this event. Chris&#x27;s box is quite capable of behaving like John Edward--directly bringing relations through to talk to those who need to hear them. Some of the responses were astoundingly clear and loud. It certainly sounded similar to what I have heard of what Bruce is getting, and honestly, it is exactly what I hope to get with my box when I receive it.

If you haven&#x27;t listened to this, you really should. I think Chris made his usual statements about Edison and the 30, but aside from that, this was a wonderful session and people were extremely moved.

If you want, I&#x27;ll find the URL.

Ann

&gt;&quot;Christopher was immediately taken by what he had seen and heard. He was able to &gt; make a direct connection with spirits. inhabitants, victims, participants, and &gt; witnesses...describing amazing events and even some unspeakable acts that had &gt; happened within the walls of these notoriously haunted places. The details &gt; afforded by these spirits gave answers to lingering questions that could not &gt; have come from anyone but the parties involved. Already amazed by the &gt; instrument&#x27;s ability to connect with these historical figures, Christopher soon &gt; realized that other entities were trying to reach out as well. Deceased fathers, &gt; sons, mothers, daughters, and friends of session participants were sending &gt; messages through the device. Talk of this spread, and last year, at the Ghost &gt; Chaser&#x27;s Weekend Conference in Savannah, Georgia, Christopher was asked to do a &gt; presentation about his research with the Telephone to the Dead. This quickly &gt; turned into an impromtu public demonstration, with participants, one by one, &gt; coming forward requesting to speak with loved ones who had died. Surprisingly, &gt; even to Christopher, these requests were met with comforting and sometimes vital &gt; messages. The presentation was recorded and broadcasted by A.P.S.R. Radio.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; From a recent add for another presentation, but apparently the rest of us get nothing like this, so it doesn&#x27;t even work for us. Guess I&#x27;ll just go back to killing time wth Ham radio, and quit wasting all my time and money on useless boxes. 
&gt; 
&gt; Curious that no one else gets any &quot;real&quot; contacts--event the so called box inventor gets nothing.
