<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, I too hate the fear-based, demons hiding behind every rock, 
better protect yourself closed-mindedness created primarily through 
traditions handed down from generation to generation and assumed to be 
the truth.  My spiritual experiences coupled with my former religious 
background opened my eyes, Frank.  

If someone wants to fear something, it will be real to them and 
something harmful. I once saw a man who was 6&#x27;2&quot; 230 lbs afraid of 
moths.  They were quite harmful to him, as he ran like a silly sissy 
monkey when he saw one.  I&#x27;m shocked he didn&#x27;t get hit by a car while 
fleeing from the harmless insects!  ;)

&gt;  I usually try to avoid all things haunting, and paranormal, mostly 
cuz I disagree with the perceptions, and fear based presentation of the 
subject, but...I&#x27;m constantly having to re-consider my own perceptions 
and paradigms. One of the guys here at work said he saw a shadow person 
in the grounds garage, and image of a squated person, just staring up 
at him. Just something to think about for me. Guess I&#x27;m more skeptical 
than I would like to admit.
