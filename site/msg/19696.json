I&#39;ve also&nbsp;studied So=\r\nuth American culture (past and present), anthropology,&nbsp;folklore&nbsp;a=\r\nnd tribal customs along with&nbsp;their indigenous wisdom systems in&nbsp;v=\r\narying&nbsp;depth with the Kogi Indians, Quechua Curanderos and residents o=\r\nf the Amazon. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;For many years I followed the w=\r\nork of Terence McKenna&nbsp;rather closely and Terence is someone I conside=\r\nr a man-genius far ahead of his time (may he rest in peace). He developed a=\r\n time-mapping system based on the I-Ching, the Mayan Calendar, Great Pyrami=\r\nds, DMT-beings, fractals, plant consciousness&nbsp;and other mathematic sys=\r\ntems&nbsp;that showed a sharp spike followed by a near-perfect &quot;dip&quot; before=\r\n it went off the charts and moved into &quot;nothingness&quot; completely around Dece=\r\nmber 21st, 2012...and even Terence didn&#39;t think this is when the world woul=\r\nd end, necessarily. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;(His &quot;official&quot; position =\r\nis that he simply didn&#39;t know what to make of it or expect. One theory is t=\r\nhat his algorithms reflected such a change during a time&nbsp;that humanity=\r\n may have finally broken the time/space barrier and uncovered the keys to t=\r\nime travel and 4th dimensional plane-shifting, to name just one possible so=\r\nlution.). &nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I&#39;ve also been fortunate enou=\r\ngh to live in Swaziland, South Africa with the Swazi, Zulu, Xhosa&nbsp;and =\r\nSan Bushmen tribes who (like most other cultures throughout time and histor=\r\ny)&nbsp;also have their own teachings and mystery traditions surrounding&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;this and other events. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Given that the San ar=\r\ne the most ancient tribal peoples and humanities oldest ancestors still liv=\r\ning in the world today and whose incredible healing knowledge, spiritual wi=\r\nsdoms and mystical practices far exceed any I&#39;ve ever heard of or personall=\r\ny witnessed anywhere else in the world and they don&#39;t seem to feel that lif=\r\ne on this&nbsp;planet&nbsp;is going to end anytime soon, so I&#39;m not going t=\r\no panic just yet. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;These amazing people have t=\r\nheir ears pressed up very closely to the heartbeat and rhythms of Mother Ea=\r\nrth and told me firsthand that before the end comes certain events will tak=\r\ne place on a scale the whole world will be instantly made aware of...events=\r\n that could still take several hundred or even thousands of years to unfold=\r\n.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;All I know for my own self, personally, is t=\r\nhat I have no clue what&#39;s going to happen...but it will be okay, no matter =\r\nwhat takes place. There are worst things than dying, believe me...and part =\r\nof what makes our work with the Ghost Box and ITC in general so helpful and=\r\n inspiring is that we can find a level of peace and comfort through our ses=\r\nsions and recordings we might actually need one day, whether soon or in som=\r\ne distant time - we&#39;re all going to end up there eventually, no doubt about=\r\n it! &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;FINAL NOTE:&lt;/STRONG&gt; I don&#39;t hav=\r\ne all the answers...I don&#39;t even have all the questions, and I know it.
