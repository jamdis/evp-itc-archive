<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>These are interesting Steve. :)

Curently, I have been using two 12-470s piped into a mixer and direct 
recorded.  The only editing has been normalizing the audio to 60db 
and trimming it out of the original recording.

This week I am switching to direct recording from a single 12-470 box 
with an amplified mic for my voice, and headphones to monitor the 
audio coming out of the radio and into the recorder.  I will post my 
results accordingly, as I am working to try and get clearer responses 
without much clean-up.  

My first response within seconds after hooking it all up as described 
was &quot;Better, Chuck.&quot;  I think when the recorder has to pick up the 
sounds from a speaker, it adds much more noise that may not need to 
be there. ;)

&gt; The random mode on this box never worked, which i feel is a great 
&gt; feature.  I changed the antenna with a piece of 20 guage wire from 
work 
&gt; and now the random seems to work really well, i really don&#x27;t 
understand 
&gt; why.  This was my first session with the random on #27, let me know 
&gt; what you guys think.  I left it as raw of files i could.  There is 
a 
&gt; couple up for interpretation that i&#x27;m not really sure of and 
another 
&gt; that says &quot;He wants to see if it&#x27;s working&quot;.  I hear &quot;He wants to 
see&quot; 
&gt; very clearly and i personally hear &quot;if it&#x27;s working&quot;, but that may 
just 
&gt; be my mind wanting to hear that.  I&#x27;m only 2 min. in to this 
recording 
&gt; from this morning, but i have to get to work so i will post what 
i&#x27;ve 
&gt; got so far.
