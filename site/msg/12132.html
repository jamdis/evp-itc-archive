Hi Misty, Kristin, and ALL...

No, I did not get beamed up just yet.  I wa=
s keeping busy with
another web project, but have decided to put that one t=
o the side and
get back into this fun and interesting stuff.
I need to catc=
h up a bit... so I'll be reading, listening, and
visiting links for a coupl=
e of weeks to get back up to speed... or at
least out of the slow lane and =
back into the passing lane.

Thanks for the warm welcome back... it's good =
to be back!

- Mike

My new place on the web:
Unidentified Frequency Oscill=
ations (UFO) Magazine
http://www.ufomagazine.net <http://www.ufomagazine.ne=
t>

An on-line venue for those hunting for
EVP, spirit communications, and =
all things
that involve oscillations of frequencies.
We're a different kind=
 of UFO Hunters :-)
