<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;d say he&#x27;s a bit delusional.  Why DO these people feel the need to declare themselves experts?  No one is an expert on this stuff!  We ALL have so much to learn!  But if anyone could even remotely call himself the &quot;world&#x27;s foremost expert on ghost box technology,&quot; it&#x27;d be Frank, as he invented it.  Just sayin&#x27;.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I recently had someone write me stating he was &quot;The worlds foremost expert in ghost box technology.&quot; I was like, &quot;What the hell?&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt; Just my thoughts on a lazy Carolina Saturday night.

&gt; &gt;  This is the box I gave to the Septic crackheads for full debunking. They
&gt; &gt; claim they have &quot;an expert&quot; to analyze it, but I think everyone realizes
&gt; &gt; they have no one honest to test the box, they just want it to go away. Which
&gt; &gt; means many get verifiable information through the box and &quot;science&quot; doesn&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; like it. How can the box work when they know there are no spirits, and since
&gt; &gt; it works, they are wrong and they just can&#x27;t *be* wrong!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  I subscribe to the skeptic newsletter, it&#x27;s a way to see what&#x27;s out there
&gt; &gt; for alternative science. Generally, if something works, the skepdicks are
&gt; &gt; all over it.
