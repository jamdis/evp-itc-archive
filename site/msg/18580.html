RJ, it is very obvious that you are not here for the same reasons we are. W=
e are trying to prove something we know, and
you are trying to disprove it =
.
Why don't we all just ignore him from now on and not reply to anything he=
 says and maybe he will go away.....
Bye RJ. You are just not in the group =
that you need to be in....

I realize you have plenty of subjective anecdotal evidence.I=
 don't consider that 'hard evidence' however.  I am looking for something a=
 little more objective and less subject to influence and interpretations.

=
And stop putting words in my mouth. A person can misinterpret something, mi=
stake something, or confuse something, without lying about something.  And =
before you jump down my throat claiming I am saying all results are mistake=
s, I am not.  I am performing experiments, keeping an open mind, and consid=
ering all evidence I find.

The way you have been attacking me by calling m=
e names at every turn, just because I try new things and don't always agree=
 with your world view, is eerily reminiscent of the way the church of old t=
ried to suppress new thought and discoveries, except you're just substituti=
ng the word 'heretic' with 'science'. and 'blasphemy' with anything that di=
sagrees with you.

There's an old saying:  "We become that which we hate". =
 So far, all you've done is denounce people's efforts to try new methods an=
d see what works.  You accept nothing anyone else proposes if it does not a=
gree with you.  That is the realm of the extreme skeptic: the same skeptic =
you ridicule.

You certainly don't have to agree with my comments.  And I d=
on't have to agree with yours.  But no one needs all the name calling Frank=
.   It really adds nothing to support your theories.

 Yeah I know, science n=

pt what others say is the same as calling us all liars, and I find very ins=
ulting.

 How irrational is it to ignore all evidence and continuously try =
to fit the phenomon into a diffintion where it will not fit and does not be=
long, and then claim you're looking for a more rational explantation, it ju=
st does not make sense. I say forget the BS "science" whatever that is, put=

 If you completely ignore what everyone el=

any data, and won't have any data no matter what.

I don't thin=
k I have enough data yet to make any conclusions, so I plan more experiment=
s.  Since there are different distinct claims about what the box or the rec=
orders can do, I try to make different distinct experiments for each.

Some=
 people claim they can get the box to tell them things that the operator co=
uldn't know, so my "whats the object" experiment is one way to examine that=
.  Some people claim the boxes can make predictions, so cataloging predicti=
ons and examining the results can help examine that.  If there are other cl=
aims, I will try to figure experiments based on those.
