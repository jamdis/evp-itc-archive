Seems a \nfew people have joined since I have been gone.\n\nSo I feel I must introduce myself. My name is Bruce Halliday, I have \nbeen a box researcher for quite sometime and have the distinct honor \nto have owned not one but two Frank&#39;s boxes and currently am doing \nresearch with the latest model frank has given out.  I also have and \ndo research with every other box that is available today. I have been \naway from this group for a couple of months now. I have decided to \nreturn to this group for the outstanding amount of professionalism \nhere.\n\nIf there are any of the new people or even the old timers that may \nneed some help or have a question, please do not hesitate to ask.\n\nI mainly came back for the specific reason, of helping whom ever I \ncan. I would like to share my experience and help to create as many \nproductive researchers as possible.\n\n\nThanks for listening\nBruce"}
