<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No, I&#x27;ll post it here. It&#x27;s the &quot;Fish Group&quot;. They aren&#x27;t people.

They have reeked havoc with a few researchers I know of.
Everything from serious poltergeist activity to getting in your head  
where you can hear them 24/7 - telepathically interfering with your  
thoughts, and they think it&#x27;s a riot. If I remember correctly, I think  
the late great Erland had a run in with them. They have been known to  
harass and be fairly nasty. I&#x27;ve never heard anything &quot;funny&quot; about  
them. They come through all things electrical and love radios. Which  
is probably why Frank gets them every so often.

They&#x27;re the types to tell people to kill their family members and all  
sorts of weird crap. They get a huge kick out of scaring researchers,  
that&#x27;s for sure.

&gt; They&#x27;re awful. I had a run in a few years ago. They are more than  
&gt; pranksters. Damn awful. Clever too.

&gt;&gt; You&#x27;re not going to find any, I fear. This seems to be an entity  
&gt;&gt; collective who enjoy teasing EVP researchers. They caused a lot of  
&gt;&gt; annoyance to other researchers in the past, but nothing serious.  
&gt;&gt; Some seemed to be afraid of them, but I never really heard of them  
&gt;&gt; doing anymore than being annoying and prankish and sometimes, well,  
&gt;&gt; actually pretty damned funny on occasion.
