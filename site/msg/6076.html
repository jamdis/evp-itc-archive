<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually animals, maybe it&#x27;s our ever present 
friends using the sounds. Just a thought.

&gt; That&#x27;s too funny!  I actually have an EVP that says &quot;Get outta 
here.&quot;  I was herding my chickens into the hen house one night and 
didn&#x27;t notice the recorder was turned on in my pocket.  I don&#x27;t think 
any of my animals can speak human yet.

&gt; 
&gt;   I have gotten our dead dogs on EVP, or through the box, but 
today, as 
&gt;   my wife an I were both downstairs, we didn&#x27;t hear the doorbell as 
the 
&gt;   neighbor kid was ringing it, so being about 7, he just came on 
in. The 
&gt;   smallest Yorkie let out a loud bark, and I swear it said &quot;get 
outta 
&gt;   here&quot;. I heard it as plan as any other speech. 
&gt; 
&gt;   I know, anecdotal evidence.
