I managed to get rid of most of the\n&gt; low frequency rumble and high-pitched background noise and left just the\n&gt; male voice frequency band.\n&gt; \n&gt; It comes through as either &quot;The best for the weather&quot; or &quot;The best for the\n&gt; level.&quot; After listening to it about 50 times I think &quot;The best for the\n&gt; level&quot; is a better statement.

It&#39;s one of the oldest houses in that town, built shortly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; after the CIvil War, and has a history of deaths in the house. I recorded\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about 6 hours of audio.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So far I&#39;ve found 3 EVP&#39;s. The first one plainly says &quot;Welcome&quot; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; everyone who has listened to it so far. The second is fairly clear to me but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; most of the other members who were on the investigation can&#39;t hear it. A\n&gt; &gt;&gt; third one sounds clear to me and to others but MIGHT be a stomach growl.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Isn&#39;t this fun?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Zack\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   On Wed, Feb 3, 2010 at 2:25 PM, April Abercrombie &lt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; april@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hi All,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; This was captured during a Ghost Hunt last weekend at Golden Hill\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Cemetery in Lakewood, CO.
