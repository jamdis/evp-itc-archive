<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just wanted some feedback here on our EVP&#x27;s especially the ones that
we have from RIPS HQ here.  There is the same distinct voice that
says, &quot;Get out&quot;....... and &quot;You think I&#x27;m stupid&quot;.  Those are loaded
on our website, but we do have several others taken from here that are
of this same deep dark voice.  

My sister thinks that I am crazy for wanting to live in this house
here, our family home that we have dubbed &quot;The RIPS HQ&quot;............. I
am not afraid of any of this, and feel that since I have grown up in
this home and now own it that this is a very weak power or otherwise
welcomes us all in some sordid way?  What&#x27;s all of you&#x27;re take on this
voice here?  Just wondering and I would really appreciate any feedback
on these........... thanks, Kay from The RIPS.
