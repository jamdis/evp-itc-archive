Also, it depends if the audio was an outright message or if \nit was put through several programs on the computer to dig it out.  \nAt that point it could have been nothing turned into something with \nthe software out there today.  Second question, i&#39;m not really sure \nwhat you mean but i have gotten additional Evp&#39;s on the recording \nafterwards that did not come out of the box at the time and i didn&#39;t \nhear it.  White noise does attract them.  Your third question is a \ngood one, i used to get into arguments all the time until i figured \nout it was the dark heads coming through trying to get you upset in \nsome way.  If you learn to block them out, it helps communication.  \nIf you don&#39;t, they win and you don&#39;t get any good research in.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Juli Velazquez&quot; \n&lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have several questions for those who currently have devices.  I \nam \n&gt; hoping you can answer.\n&gt; \n&gt;      When listening to some of the messages you currently have \nposted \n&gt; like the message regarding Tesla, why is it that some come thru so \n&gt; very clear and audiable to understand vs. others?  Most of mine \naudio \n&gt; I have gotten from the boxes are very clear to hear outright.\n&gt; \n&gt;       Second question?  In those who have tested it at a proposed \n&gt; location, have they ever gotten addition evp relating to the \nmessages \n&gt; coming over the box?  The reason I asked is because I have.  When \n&gt; video taping the box being used, I got a warning of sorts prior to \n&gt; the message from the box.  Has anyone else experienced this?\n&gt; \n&gt;       Third, has anyone ever gotten into a heated debate with \nsomeone \n&gt; over the box. A two way conversation that had the potential of \n&gt; getting nasty?  Or things that came across that were not nice?\n&gt; \n&gt; I would love to know if anyone has experienced any of this events.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Juli\n&gt;"}
