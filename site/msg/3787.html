&gt; I know where the instinct to protect your children comes from 
having two of my own but what do you think will happen to them if 
they are exposed to a box, radio, or other electronic device that 
allows our human senses to interpret a spirits existence. The beings 
that we speak to are close to our own vibrations, attitudes and 
dispositions. They are similar in character to ourselves otherwise 
they would not even notice us. We have all seen what can happen when 
you try to make contact while in different moods or dispositions. 
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think a child would come in contact with? Why is this 
anymore dangerous for a child than yourself? Do you honestly think 
you are prepared or know more about what you are doing than a child? 
If you think that you are fooling yourself! We are all equally 
ignorant!
&gt; 
&gt; Like attracts Like! This is a phrase we have all heard for years 
but it took on a new meaning when we started research in ITC. Please 
don&#x27;t fool yourselves, the beings are around you whether you operate 
a box or not. They influence, guide, protect and watch our lives. All 
negative experiences I have ever seen either when I was in the field 
or teaching someone at a meeting was caused by fear. Fear is the root 
of all hatred and evil (whatever evil is). Fear keeps us from 
learning and experiencing new things.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t know about ya&#x27;ll but my children are well aware of what 
daddy does. They are educated on how my equipment works and even know 
the names of some of the spirits who regularly come through. They are 
interested in the afterlife just like everyone else and I teach them 
in a completely positive light. They do not fear life or death and I 
hope they never make decisions while worrying about either. I will 
promote those ideals until the time comes for them to leave my house 
and they make their own decisions.
&gt; 
&gt; What I am trying to say is, quit protecting your children from 
something you don&#x27;t even know if they need protection from. All you 
are doing is generating fear!
