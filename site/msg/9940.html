<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve had a mini since December, when he began to produce them. Mine  
produces very unique results--you can hear them in the files section-- 
of which I am delighted. I have nothing but good things to say about  
Ron&#x27;s minis and I hope you have the astounding success with them that  
I feel I have.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A few people have seen my ebay listing and commented about the price
&gt; &gt; listed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ebay will not allow you to change a description after the item has
&gt; &gt; been listed. They do however allow you to add and amending  
&gt; statement.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Which I have done In Big Bold Red Letters, the price listing was a
&gt; &gt; mistake. I am certainly not trying to misrepresent the item or  
&gt; make a
&gt; &gt; profit on it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have also lowered the reserve price on it as a result of the
&gt; &gt; mistake.
&gt; &gt; Believe me I will be taking a loss on the box.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have already sent my apologies to Rick Moran from Paranormal
&gt; &gt; systems.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And now extend my apologies for the mistake to anyone that was
&gt; &gt; interested in it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The reason for selling the MB was not the money, it was the guilt of
&gt; &gt; having this excellent piece of equipment go without the attention it
&gt; &gt; deserves. And the hopes that someone or some group can utilize it
&gt; &gt; more than myself.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But I could not as much as I would have liked to, give it away.
&gt; &gt; My intention was to get back at least a decent amount of my
&gt; &gt; investment.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hope no one gets the wrong idea and thinks ill of me.
&gt; &gt;
