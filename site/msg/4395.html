Bruce--can you shoot me a private e-mail on how to reach you if I  
need you today? (Have a feeling I might...)

&gt; I ran a session last night for the first time, but got nothing. There
&gt; are a lot of radio stations in this area (Baltimore-Washington) and I
&gt; just could not get a tuning that gave me any confidence that what I
&gt; heard wasn&#x27;t broadcast fragments--and really, nothing came through
&gt; that made me even wonder if.... Anyway, I went bed last night
&gt; thinking that I&#x27;m going to prove the exception to the rule and this
&gt; won&#x27;t work for me, but I&#x27;m gonna give it a go again today.
&gt;
&gt; Any of you tech guys around today if I need some help with setting
&gt; and other tech issues?
