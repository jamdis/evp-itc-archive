I've heard the same said for the evp researchers!=C2=A0 But it's not that s=
imple in either case:
the last block that you reference has small print tha=
t says "Compare the hypothesis to the experiment's conclusion".=C2=A0 Which=
 of course you can't do unless you already visited the hypothesis block and=
 have a hypothesis to which to compare.=C2=A0 That in turn has small print =
which says "predict the outcome of the problem", which of course you can't =
do either unless you've already visited the earlier block of Purpose ("stat=
e the problem").

I don't think it's helpful to deny good evidence, whether=
 it is good evidence from someone claiming to have detected spirits, or whe=
ther it is good evidence from someone claiming that people can mistake nois=
e for speech or random radio tunings for spirit control.=C2=A0 That's why t=
he scientific method is valuable: it keeps both the skeptic and the believe=
r real.
