I realize you have plenty of subjective anecdotal evidence.I don't consider=
 that 'hard evidence' however.=C2=A0 I am looking for something a little mo=
re objective and less subject to influence and interpretations.

And stop p=
utting words in my mouth. A person can misinterpret something, mistake some=
thing, or confuse something, without lying about something.=C2=A0 And befor=
e you jump down my throat claiming I am saying all results are mistakes, I =
am not.=C2=A0 I am performing experiments, keeping an open mind, and consid=
ering all evidence I find. 

The way you have been attacking me by calling =
me names at every turn, just because I try new things and don't always agre=
e with your world view, is eerily reminiscent of the way the church of old =
tried to suppress new thought and discoveries, except you're just substitut=
ing the word 'heretic' with 'science'. and 'blasphemy' with anything that d=
isagrees with you.

There's an old saying:=C2=A0 "We become that which we h=
ate".=C2=A0 So far, all you've done is denounce people's efforts to try new=
 methods and see what works.=C2=A0 You accept nothing anyone else proposes =
if it does not agree with you.=C2=A0 That is the realm of the extreme skept=
ic: the same skeptic you ridicule.
=C2=A0
You certainly don't have to agree=
 with my comments.=C2=A0 And I don't have to agree with yours.=C2=A0 But no=
 one needs all the name calling Frank.=C2=A0=C2=A0 It really adds nothing t=
o support your theories.
