Hi John,
 
I occasionally get down to Ft. Lauderdale and am contemplating going down  
some time this summer again.  Would you be interested in getting together  if my 
wife and I go?  We would love to see what is happening down  there.  We would 
be staying at the beach area off a1a.  We could meet  at Aruba's for lunch to 
start ...:)
 
Jeff

Hi Gang,
My name is John Marc Carr, president/founder of SEFGR, South East Florida  
Ghost Research. I organized this group in 1998, and have been in the research  
of Ghost and Paranormal happenings ever since. I'm the official paranormal  
researcher for the Stranahan House which is Fort Lauderdale's oldest and most  
haunted historical landmark. We have gotten many EVP's by use of digital  
recorder. There are 5 intelligent haunts that are in the house and one  residual 
haunt outside of the house. Most of the evp work has been handled by  me, but I 
have been teaching some of my member to work their own  recordings.
 
I am totally fascinated by your use of the "Frank's Box". My  congradulations 
to your success, Frank and those who use the box on the  research that you've 
accomplished. In this, I'm also dissappointed by those  who have used your 
box to make money or notority to gain fame by it. I won't  mention names, to 
mention them will only give them more strength. 
 
We are currently trying to do the Radio Shack hack of the 12-469 and hope  to 
be successful in this trial by error. Hoping that our work will produce  
something that we've been trying to accomplish like you all have, two way  
communication with astral beings. It's fustrating to do digital recordings and  
having to wait and sift through the recordings to get information. We hope to  
elliminate that with the hack.
 
Are Frank's boxes available for retail? I've heard of the Mini Box that  is 
coming out soon and they are taking pre-orders for this product. Our group  is 
small and we don't charge for our research at the historical landmarks that  
we do here in Fort Lauderdale, so we are looking for the best at the lowest  
route approach.
 
Our next project is a Historical Firehouse that is haunted by the ghost  of 
Robert Leland Knight. There is a mystery on how he died, but legend goes  that 
he fallen in a water puddle that was electricfied by a downed wire. He  was a 
large man and a Golden Glove champ of Florida. It was his second week of  
working at the firestation and he didn't have his gear because it had to be  
ordered. There is some who think (psychics) that he might have been pushed out  of 
the firetruck as a prank that went wrong.
 
This firehouse has had media play with the Sci-fi channel in a show  called 
"Proof Positive". The firestation is becoming a museum, and is allowing  us to 
spend the night in doing an investigation about Robert. There are some  who 
believe that some of the haunt has to do with a hanging tree that was at  the 
opposite corner of the Firestation. We are excited about doing an  investigation 
of this Historical Landmark, but are cautious of the fact that  there will be 
low level spirits/astral beings that might be present.
 
Frank, If you have the time to answer me, that will be great. Those who  have 
the "Frank's box", if you can tell me how you obtained yours, that will  be 
helpful also. I would be greatful for any help at this point.
 
Thanks for letting me listen in on all of your discoveries and  successes.
 
Best Regards,
John Marc Carr
