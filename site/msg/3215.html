<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, that&#x27;s just it. No one knows what to do with the
considerations. No one has a good feel for what the potential pitfalls
are. No one knows. Yet, we are willing to support the distribution of
them. Too soon, I fear. Too soon. 
There is no training, no guidance offered... just hand over the keys. 
For the love of money. Power is a strong aphrodisiac.

&gt;  It&#x27;s not that concerns are not considered, I think no one knows
what to do with it. There&#x27;s not enough box users, and ITC researchers
out there to really good feel for what the pitfalls are. So far after
seven years of EVP/ITC work I can say onlly that these dark entities,
or wahtever it is talk bad, and threaten, and that&#x27;s about all they
do. They threaten, I tell them to bring it, and....nothin&#x27;! Paper
tigers I say. 
&gt;  
&gt;  As far as some fears that portals are opened, and all kinds of evil
comes in, I don&#x27;t believe that either. They are already have full
access, they already exist in more demensions, making this physical
level about the lowest level of spiritual existence/evolution. Just
about all these worries are old fear crap to keep people in church. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to with hold the stuff cuz of a few nut
jobs, you have the same problem with everything from bicycles to
airplanes. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I had that concern about selling my boxes, but how would you screen
users? You can&#x27;t. Not everyone can use a quija board, and not too many
unbalanced ding dongs get in trouble with those anyway.

&gt; 
&gt; I am a fairly quiet person, most of the time. I have my thoughts
andopinions on topics but feel strongly about &quot;to each his own&quot;.
Unlesssomething strikes me as completely wrong, I won&#x27;t debate. No one
herehas heard from me other than recently with this mini-box yet, I
amhere several times weekly reading and offering my energy in support
ofthe research.However...something is striking me here and again, I
can&#x27;t keep mymouth shut. The discussion about the family hour with the
box has ledthe way for people to mention negativity and even &quot;the dark
guys&quot; canbe fun if not taken seriously.I ask you to consider the fact
that many who purchase the mini-boxwill not be of the right frame of
mind. Most will not be in harmony.Many will take &quot;the dark guys&quot;
seriously. Yet, you feel it&#x27;s a goodidea to let anyone who wants a box
have one? All in the name ofsharing technology.I know that my previous
posts expressing my concern over the massmarketing of the box, was
barely given consideration. Realize that Iam not being selfish- I do
not own a box. EVP is my passion and hasbeen from day one 6 years ago
when I jumped fully into the field. I amsuccessful in capturing EVP,
always have been. I still do it the &quot;oldfashioned way&quot; with open air
techniques. Would I love to be able tohold real time 2 way
communications with the other side? Of course.However, I do not think
enough research into the possibilities hasbeen done to warrant the
approval let alone production of these boxes. Those of us who have
been on countless investigations with many peoplewill quickly admit
that there are some people we&#x27;d rather notinvestigate with. When they
are present, negative things tend tohappen. We all know one or two
people who we can say &quot;felt dark&quot; fromthe first meeting. We all admit
that being mentally sound is animportant quality in this field. If you
have mental issues, this maynot be the area of research for you. We
don&#x27;t bring children oninvestigations for obvious reasons. BUT! If you
want a box that couldpossibly open up a portal and bridge the gap
between here and thedark, sure! Anyone who wants one should have it!
You might feel that I am over reacting or being overly dramatic.That&#x27;s
fine. My concern is not what you think of me but that youconsider the
possibilities here. Many of which we do not know. Can yoube 100% sure
that this is a good idea or that it&#x27;s worthy of saying&quot;well, we&#x27;ll see
what happens&quot;? --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce

[EVP-ITC] Family hour around the radio&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe we&#x27;re just a
little unconventional in our household, but mostof us here are pretty
open to the idea of the multiverse. Gathering ina circle around our
Frank&#x27;s Box is our idea of quality family time.The messages are
relevent, the interest is high, and we&#x27;re very wellgrounded and do not
let the tricksters push us around.HappyThanksgiving from our home to
yours. -Bill &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
