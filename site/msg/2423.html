<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank,

Some times you just gotta take the bull by the horns !

you would be surprised how resilient animals are. Of course you would 
not want the little thing to be in pain but if everyone gave in to 
these extortionists, these gangsters without guns. There would be no 
limit. And that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s coming too. Thank goodness the little thing 
had people that cared enough to even try, most would have given the dog 
the shot and moved on. congratulations and score one for the workin man.
