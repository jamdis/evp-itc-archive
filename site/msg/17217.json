Sometimes I\nuse a method known as teh foreign language method where you tune in a\nforeign language on shortwave that you don&#39;t understand, and record directly\nfrom the speaker, using the foreign language as the raw audio. In &#39; &#39;1854 at\n10 seconds &quot;Big waves are comin&#39; &quot;, I was tuned into a Chinese broadcast for\nthat one. Note the truncated word, my guys almost always use this form of\nspeech.\n\n In &#39; &#39; 1855 I used Spanish-- I think  and at the end something about\n&quot;Peoples got sick I didn&#39;t know that&quot;.\n\nBTW, the Sony was nothing but noise when connected to this thing&#39;s line\ninputs.\n\n Ahhhhm they joy of putting up more skeptic fodder!\n\n F-S\n\nI se up his adio because i has a line inpu and wan ed o connec   he Sony A mBand adio o i , bu -- I has sho wa e so i u ned ha on he see i any hing was coming h ough, he sho wa e bands we e ac i e.
