<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I didnt know anyone else here was interested in projection. Ive wrote 
some articles years ago on the subject, perhaps if people want the 
links Ill post them here. Also there are quite a few good books on the 
subject. All 3 books by Robert A. Monroe (Journeys out of the body, Far 
Journeys, Ultimate Journey) Astral Dynamics by Robert Bruce, Cosmic 
Journeys by Rosalind Mcknight (Her accounts from working with Robert 
Monroe) The Projection of the Astral Body by Sylvan Muldoon, and if you 
can get your hands on it Astral Projection: A Record of Out-of-the-Body 
Experiences by Oliver Fox (not his real name but who cares) that book 
is out of print so you probably have to find it online it was printed 
in 1962 or even earlier I think. Anyway this list should keep you busy 
for now, there are a ton more good books on the subject. Well enjoy and 
practice. Regards,
                 T.L.

&gt; I have been able to astral project a couple of times, but only after  
&gt; listening to A.P. tapes for at least 6 months. It was awesome!!!! And 
that was  back 
&gt; in 1992. Sure wish I could do it again. Maybe I will someday.
