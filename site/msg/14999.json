We had six video cameras set up in the three halls of the\n&gt; building. The video for all was being monitored and recorded at a central\n&gt; location. Alas, we did not have microphones at the camera sites conected to\n&gt; the central location. I wonder what we might have heard if we did?\n&gt;\n&gt; Zack\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, Jun 8, 2009 at 12:05 PM, threadsintyme@... &lt;\n&gt; Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s just agree to end this discussion about her...\n&gt; Why don&#39;t we discuss something on a lighter note?
