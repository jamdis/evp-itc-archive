Hear me out, okay, my friend? I do think that\nmaybe I will start attaching original and cleaned up samples together,\nso the two can be compared. We both know that we clean them up to help\nthe message, which *is* there and not added by us, to be better heard.\nThat&#39;s not the argument--at least not from me. But it might be\nhelpful, in general, to hear the two versions side by side. \n&gt; \n&gt; This said, to Babs: You&#39;re going to have to live with the fact that\nnot all of the communication is in response to questions. If a\nquestion was spoken near where the communication came through, I try\nto include it. But there are plenty of times when I am not being\naddressed at all, as best I can tell. They&#39;re talking amonst\nthemselves and issuing orders, etc. So, clips without questions aren&#39;t\ngoing to change and you need to accept them for what they are.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as removing time: I don&#39;t see an issue with it if the clip is\nnoted, rather as in journalism where we add ... to denote that\nmaterial has been removed that was tangential to the main thrust of\nthe quote.\n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, I have to slow my communication stuff down by about\nhalf. It comes through incredibly fast. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone.\nAnother deal-with-it issue. Slowing is not manipulating. Neither is\namplification of fainter responses or deamplification of nonassociated\nnoise.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some if us are recording mono and some stereo. Silencing one track\nto better hear another is also not manipulating it falls in the\njournalistic convention &quot;...&quot; category, to me anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; Still, point taken on combining both unprocessed and processed clips.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for all the rest of the fretting about counting stations and\ndividing up times and all, I&#39;d say if you want to do it, knock\nyourself out. I don&#39;t think it ultimately matters because we&#39;re\nalready postulating that most of the time, the voice we hear is not\nthe real voice of the communicant. It doesn&#39;t matter if you hear blips\nof the same announcer coming through at 15 second intervals. It&#39;s what\nthe voice might say that is important. I know that isn&#39;t what you want\nto hear, but I think it&#39;s probably valid.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Jan 21, 2008, at 11:52 AM, bruce halliday wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank R., Once again pal, we are on apposing sides.As far as Babs\nhaving many friends here Welllll??? Anyway I want to address the\nsubject of removing time from a file.The way I am understanding what\nyou mean by removing time is tocut segments of the recording out of\nthe file. I myself do cut out simple noise or static fragments that\nare naturally occurring in the sweep of the boxfor instance the\nminibox has an inherent hum or thump as it&#39;s Creator calls it. When I\nreceive a response through the minibox it will go something like this\n&quot;yes HUM Bruce HUM we HUM are HUM here HUM&quot;I will definitely remove\nevery HUM from between the words but that does not change the message\nor affect the words that are spoken.I&#39;m assuming that is what you are\ntalking about when you and babs mention &quot;removing time&quot;  I&#39;m just\nguessing but maybe babs is trying to insinuate that researchers here\nare altering their files., If so maybe she should be looking for that\nin her own back yard. There must be someone she knows for a fact that\nisaltering communications. And mike please lets not turn this into a\nwhole big thing!

Let me say that you have many friends\nand associates here just for the simple fact that you have an interest\nin ITC, are a researcher and a complex thinker. I think we have shown\nin the past that we can have a disagreement and still remain friends.\nYou make a lot of good points in your post and I would like to know\nwho removes time from their recordings. I have never removed time from\nmy recordings and see no reason why anyone else would without saying\nso in an accompanied post.I have limited experience with the 12-469&#39;s\nas a single piece of equipment. I have arranged mine per Mike&#39;s,\n&quot;Spiricomp&quot; design. I have 3, 12-469&#39;s feeding a four channel mixer,\nwhich goes into a laptop running DC6 with Soundsoap 2. Mine scan\nequally spaced on the FM band. I have had pretty good results until\nrecently.At first the messages were pretty clear but I had a feeling I\nwas getting a different group than I normally have for the last few\nyears. When I would ask about my friends on the other side they would\ntell me they will look for them. Well about 2 weeks ago the 12-469\narrangement started generating a lot of interference and feedback. I\nstarted hearing radio static voices as I use to get with shortwave.\nNot voice fragments but voices made of static (metallic and robotic).\nThey were breaking through the sweeping. I had a feeling someone else\nwas trying to force their way through. Finally the interference got so\nbad I was forced to revert back to a simpler method I used before,\nwhich is using fan noise. One of the first messages to come across was\nfrom a familiar voice telling me and I quote, &quot;your method sucks&quot;. I\nhave not used the 12-469&#39;s since because of the clear messages I have\nbeen getting using water and fan noise. That does not mean I have\ngiven up on the 12-469&#39;s but I won&#39;t use them again until I am\npersuaded to by my friends on the otherside that they are willing to\nuse and adapt to it. To my knowledge only Misty, Laura and myself use\nwater for recording.Regards,Frank R.\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----From: babiarz3 &lt;babiarz3@...&gt;To:\nEVP-ITC@...: Monday, January 21, 2008 9:34:01 AMSubject: [EVP-ITC]\nBabs has Issues!\n&gt; \n&gt; Alright, you all know I&#39;m vocal and I haven&#39;t made any &quot;friends&quot;\nherebut, if we can put that aside for a moment...Spirit communication\nhas been my passion since day one, a little over6 years ago. I am a\nbeliever in the afterlife and a believer inspirits attempting to\ncommunicate with us for a variety of reasons. Ihave spiritual beliefs\nthat I feel strongly about and devote much ofmy waking (and sleeping)\nmoments to thoughts about this field.However, I am also a researcher\nand a skeptic. In order for me toallow ideas to become part of my\nreality I must experiment. In orderfor me to believe something is\nparanormal I HAVE to rule out all otherpossible causes. That being\nsaid, I have some questions. My hope isthat there are some here\nwilling to enter into discussion with me.I have a difficult time with\nmany of the files here. Many times, thereis no question included in\nthe file. I can not determine whether ornot the &quot;reply&quot; is an\nintelligent reply. Maybe this has to do withallowable file size.Some\nof the files I have been able to download. (I don&#39;t always keepmy\nemail settings on for this group as I get too many - lol) When Ilook\nat the file I see problems. There will be complete flat linesilence\nbetween the words. Many times the &quot;reply&quot; is also at the samedecibel\nas the question askers voice. Those two things should notoccur\nnaturally considering the devices being used. That tells me thatthere\nis manipulation of the files. Now, what is manipulation to me,may not\nbe manipulation to others. To me, any altering of the recordedfile\nconstitutes manipulation. I do not know if the reply wasintelligent or\nmanipulated to be intelligent. Some say that they simply remove the\n&quot;no response&quot; time. I&#39;ve beentold it can be as much as 18 seconds\nremoved from between words. Nowwe run into the problem of us deciding\nwhat word fits in with thequestion. What words are being ignored? Did\nwe take nonsense and makesense? Did we amp every noise/word or only\nwhat fit?I think it&#39;s great that files are offered for peer review.\nHowever, Ithink we have to load them untouched or at the very least,\nofferexactly what was done to the entire file. Time elapsed between\nwords,what was amped, etc. I&#39;d also love to see some of these sessions\nvideotaped with the question asker facing the camera and a second\nhandclock visible. Truly, we aren&#39;t researching if we don&#39;t have\nsomeprotocol in place.Here is an issue I have with the RS Hacks. I\nhave the 469. It takesapproximately 18 seconds to scan through the AM\nfrequencies. Now, thetypical person would think that we can take that\n18 seconds and divideit by the number of AM stations to determine how\nlong we are on eachstation before moving on to the next one. In that\nway we coulddetermine what is impossible to be said via a radio\nfragment. However,that&#39;s not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one\nfrequency to thenext and of course the biggest problem is that some\nstations arepicked up over multiple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard\non 630, 640,650, 660 and maybe even 670. That extends the time a great\ndeal. Thisis a difficult problem because it is almost impossible for\nthe averageperson to be able to make a determination on time this way.\nI heard about the following today; An experimenter records at the\nsametime every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importance of\nmeditating,automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but what\nwe have toremember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning\ninto the sameradio show every day. One of my first experiments with\nthe 469 had mehearing this deep male voice over and over again. What\nwas he tryingto tell me, I wondered. Than I realized that he was\nspeakingapproximately every 18 seconds; every time the scan hit that\nstation.So, if you are removing up to 18 seconds between words, then\nyou arereally only recording the words from one station. This post is\nIN NO WAY trying to start anything besides discussionabout some\nresearch problems. I know that there are those who are notconcerned\nwith anything more than the communication itself but I thinkthat it is\nof the utmost importance to attempt to factor in someprotocol in order\nfor this to be considered serious research at all. \n&gt; \n&gt; Looking for last minute shopping deals?
