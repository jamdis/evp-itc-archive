&gt;  Every year I guess, there a 
conference/gathering/investigation/party at the Stanley Motel here. 
More box user/makers are going this year. These investigators are 
such paranormal experts that they consitently ignore what the 
inventor of the box says. I made the damn thing, it works, I 
obvioulsy know how it works and how to make it, yet they ignore what 
I say. That&#x27;s this weekend, BTW. 
&gt;  
&gt;  If the boxes, both mine and ones made by others worked for these 
people you&#x27;d see the voices posted everywhere on the web, instead the 
you get &quot;oh, we had to send that off to be anayzed&quot;, what a crock! 
All these people are doing is trying to jump on Moon&#x27;s bandwagon. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Perhaps Moon&#x27;s statement on his site that I don&#x27;t with any groups 
was pre-cognitive. I think that&#x27;s a good idea. These 
groups/investigators tend to have preconcieved ideas about what the 
evidence consists of, and ignore anything that doesn&#x27;t fit into that. 
Yeah, that&#x27;s scientific all to hell.

   Hi Frank &amp; All, Perhaphs these Paranormal Investigators (some with 
many books they&#x27;ve written, too) are the wrong types of -&quot;Experts&quot;- 
people to have or use the boxes (for their own benifits, too)? It 
seems someone who&#x27;d be dedicated in doing their own &quot;independant&quot; 
Research then writting about it or doing Low-Cost demos. of the box 
(now &amp; then) would be a better way to go with these boxes  . . . and 
of course the 1st thing to mention is WHO the maker IS; Mr. Frank 
Sumption!!!  My 2c worth, here!     =Judy=  P.S. I look at what other 
Pioneers have done with EVP&#x27;s &amp; ITC&#x27;s!!!</pre>
