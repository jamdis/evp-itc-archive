I&#39;ve had loads of articles  \ndue. Rosemary Guiley and I also almost died of heatstroke at a show  \nwe were both working last weekend. It was over 100 at 10 am. I told  \nher I was sorry to meet her looking so disreputable, but  \ncircumstances were what they were... Anyway, Rosemary, let&#39;s try to  \nmeet up in more civilized circs soon. :)\n\nAnyway, Frank gifted me box 31 about a month and half ago, and it has  \nonly been this week that my son and I have been able to A.) Get all  \n18 batteries in the right direction without any falling out ;) , B.)  \nSit down and see if we could make the connection. Yesterday got it  \nrolling, but first he had to turn on his RS hack and tell them about  \nbox 31 and that he wanted them to try it. He says almost immediately  \nhe began hearing Frank&#39;s name and &quot;purple&quot; through 31.\n\nFrank, I don&#39;t know what you do, but I swear it&#39;s like a baby taking  \nits first breath or something--the &quot;reflex&quot; of the box seems to be to  \ncall for you. Even my mini did, remember?\n\nSo, we just did a session today. We didn&#39;t record it, because we  \ndidn&#39;t figure we&#39;d get much and would fooling about with where to  \nhang the antenna wire and all. But, sure enough, within minutes, we  \nwere getting responses to our simple questions, hearing the tech  \nwords I have become used to, such as &quot;check,&quot; the technician Stu said  \nhis name, someone called my name, and when I asked if we should sign  \noff, someone clearly said, &quot;Yes.&quot; I said &quot;Thank you,&quot; and the  \nimmediate response was, &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;\n\n31 is very different to my mini--I can see that already. Nick and I  \nwill keep you posted about our next round of contact.\n\n\nAnn"}
