I can only guess what Grass Harp has degenerated into \nnow. Even Wisteria sent her two cents worth, then blocked my e-mail \nso I couldn&#39;t reply. Oh well, stupid is as stupid does!\n\n Ya can&#39;t keep it friendly, so everyone can share results, and \nmethods, there&#39;s always some whacko that wants to be the world&#39;s \nonly expert, and no on else is allowed to do any work, or post any \nresults that may make the &quot;Expert&quot; look bad, especially when the  \nwhacko &quot;Expert&quot; gets no contacts at all! \n\n All of this being said for the benefit of any other Grass Harp \nmembers that may be lurking here. You&#39;ll notice, membership is still \nnot screened, and posts not filtered. Anytime someone thinks the \nPrincess is some weak minded fool, and can be attacked easily, all I \ncan say is bring it! \n\n BTW, what&#39;s stops anyone from joining multiple groups, and lists? \nI&#39;m on a few others myself, like Unknown Country,  Darkness  On Edge \nRadio, Lightworker-Psychic-ET Hangout, and Millennium-Predictions.\n\n What small little minds these people have that would attack others!\n\n\n\n Frank"}
