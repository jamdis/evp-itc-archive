<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sorry to have been so out of the loop. I&#x27;ve had loads of articles  
due. Rosemary Guiley and I also almost died of heatstroke at a show  
we were both working last weekend. It was over 100 at 10 am. I told  
her I was sorry to meet her looking so disreputable, but  
circumstances were what they were... Anyway, Rosemary, let&#x27;s try to  
meet up in more civilized circs soon. :)

Anyway, Frank gifted me box 31 about a month and half ago, and it has  
only been this week that my son and I have been able to A.) Get all  
18 batteries in the right direction without any falling out ;) , B.)  
Sit down and see if we could make the connection. Yesterday got it  
rolling, but first he had to turn on his RS hack and tell them about  
box 31 and that he wanted them to try it. He says almost immediately  
he began hearing Frank&#x27;s name and &quot;purple&quot; through 31.

Frank, I don&#x27;t know what you do, but I swear it&#x27;s like a baby taking  
its first breath or something--the &quot;reflex&quot; of the box seems to be to  
call for you. Even my mini did, remember?

So, we just did a session today. We didn&#x27;t record it, because we  
didn&#x27;t figure we&#x27;d get much and would fooling about with where to  
hang the antenna wire and all. But, sure enough, within minutes, we  
were getting responses to our simple questions, hearing the tech  
words I have become used to, such as &quot;check,&quot; the technician Stu said  
his name, someone called my name, and when I asked if we should sign  
off, someone clearly said, &quot;Yes.&quot; I said &quot;Thank you,&quot; and the  
immediate response was, &quot;You&#x27;re welcome.&quot;

31 is very different to my mini--I can see that already. Nick and I  
will keep you posted about our next round of contact.
