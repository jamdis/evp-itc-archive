It is a linear sweep circuit, and I keep frying resistors on the initial voltage divider. I don&#39;t think that the 10 ohm value is correct as listed. I know little to nothing about electronics, but I am trying to learn. On the breadboard I keep cooking off 1/2 watt resistors, and by the voltage calculators I found online, using those values seems to be putting close to 2 watts though the resistors. I can only think that the 10 ohm divider values are wrong, but I don&#39;t know what they should be.\n\nI think I will just try your circuit, although it is a bit intimidating to a newbie, lol. I have no problem assembling pcb stuff according to directions, but the actual building and experimenting with, well I am still trying to learn. \n\nThanks so much for your contributions with the schematics. I am looking forward to making an externally sweep tuned 469 or 820.\n\nthanks \nAndy\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Well, if I could draw this stuff accurately it might help. There was some mistakes in the random section of the sweep circuit. So I replaced the sweep schematic in my folder. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
