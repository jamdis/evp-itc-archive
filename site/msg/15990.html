There are people who say that you can influence what you get psychically, t=
hat though you didn't consciously know about that information, you subconsc=
iously knew it.

I don't buy that. I have seen absolutely no real proof of =
that ever happening.

    There is no doubt in=
 my mind about that. You are right April =3D) In the beginning I did seek s=
ome proof for my own sanity. But time and time again I have learned much mo=

my dead loved ones, its more about learning and growing from the experience=

          I would definitely call that proof. The strength of=
 the proof is in the part that you knew nothing about what the message woul=
d mean to the person, or if it a message for you, it was some fact that you=
 had not known prior.

          IMO, in this case there is no way it would=
 be a case matrixing or hearing what you wanted or expected to hear, that i=

            I think quite often when the message isn't for me and it'=
s for someone outside of this research it matters very much that the messag=

 recipient. To me it may seem dumb or meaningless but to the person who the=

sometimes the info doesnt become clear til much later down the road when I =
learn that bit of info or watch that predictive message become reality. It'=
s all very interesting and educational =3D)

box to find missing persons (which I didn't know was possible), and the con=
versation mentions hearing specific voice inflections and recognizing a dea=

M<BR>> 
            <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> I was googling about AM r=
adio reception, 
            and I came across the below exchange on a foru=
m. It talks about 
            using the box to find missing persons (which=
 I didn't know was 
            possible), and the conversation mentions he=
aring specific voice 
            inflections and recognizing a dead person=
's specific voice on the 
            box. My question is, do any of you ge=
t a recognizable voice? The 
            voices I get always sound robotic,=
 although I do get clearly male or 
            female voices. <BR>> <BR=
