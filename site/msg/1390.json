(Well, I like the term &quot;paranormal investigator&quot; \nbetter!)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve gotten a lot of EVP&#39;s on a pocket DVR but I found and \ndownloaded the \n&gt; schematics for Frank&#39;s ghost box some months ago.  I&#39;m fascinated \nby this \n&gt; idea and I hope I can find the time to build the equipmeont some \ntime \n&gt; soon. Hopefully I will get beyond the 70-80 hour work weeks I&#39;ve \nbeen \n&gt; putting in for the last couple months ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking forward to seeing what&#39;s happening on this group!\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt;"}
