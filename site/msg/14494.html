  Riddle me this..  They must be manipulating because of the revers=
e messages I get.  I spoke of this earlier in an email and I have attached =
an example.  Recently I did a session where I hear real-time "GREAT BATTLE"=
 .  It actually sounded like BABBLE but I recognized the word to mean battl=
e because a clip just before spoke of a soldier..  Anyway.. I reversed GREA=
T BATTLE and the word BABBLE in reverse said WHO WON.  Now anyway you look =
at it BATTLE or BABBLE in reverse when you or I say it will not come out as=
 WHO WON.  To verify this I recorded myself saying GREAT BATTLE and GREAT B=
ABBLE three time and lowering my voice each time.  I tried to match the int=
onation of my clip as well.



  I was correct.  When I say BATTLE or BABBL=
E it in no way sounds like 'Who Won'.  It isn't even decipherable. I have a=
ttached my clip from the session.  I saved it as GREAT BATTLE (f) WHO WON (=
r).  The next - Reverse Test - is me saying GREAT BATTLE / BABBLE 3 times a=
nd then reversed.  



  This happens all the time.  Spirit is using both s=
ides of a digital recording and that to me infers intelligence.
