<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes--Sarah used reel-to-reel and occasionally cassette. I bought my  
first reel-to-reel from her husband, back in the day. Sarah had a  
bunch of them and her husband was always looking for them at yards  
sales to pass onto AAEVP members. He&#x27;d get them and fix them up. I  
still have the one he got for me. I used several back them myself and  
had three or four when I had to pause in taping for the birth of my  
son. It took me many years to get back to it...

&gt; Hi All, Been awhile since I&#x27;ve posted here, but was wondering about  
&gt; the
&gt; methods Sarah used with her reel to reel tape recorder (Technics or
&gt; Teac model - anyone know which???) as it seems she got MANY Spirit
&gt; voices or EVP&#x27;s this way. Not to knock, Frank&#x27;s Boxes or other Ghost
&gt; Boxes! Just a though! I may have an opportunity to get a $160.
&gt; refurbised Teac or Technics reel to reel tape recorder, but am
&gt; wondering IF I should get it or not (it&#x27;s a 1970&#x27;s model appearently)!
&gt; Comments/ideas? Thanks! =Judy= 8-D
