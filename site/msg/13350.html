I have one of a handful of the Edison Autobiography that has the last chap=
ter with his thoughts on the great beyond.=A0 His family had that version o=
f the biography recalled and reissued it without the last chapter.

Anyway =
in this last chapter, Edison alludes to a way to communicate with the dead =
but he never says he did it.=A0 He simply hypothesizes on how it could be d=
one and the fact that the dead are just on a different wavelength than the =
living.

Sorry, no links...=A0 This is from that old fashioned thing called=
 a book :))

I can tell you how to find your own copy though if you wish.=
=A0 I need to find the actual page count from my copy but I went to amazon'=
s used books and asked every seller how many pages their copy was.=A0 The f=
irst one to respond with the correct (bigger) number, that was the one I bo=
ught.

Don

PS but don't spend alot.=A0 The info in the last chapter is not=
 worth much.

            I suppose ultimately, it doesn't really matter if Edison made=

I have also hear=

Edison was working on=

when he mentioned workin=

the real story.



If you h=

sure it is as close to the =

someone quoting someone quoting an ar=

views of life after death:

That is the kind of link I'd be hoping for regarding your st=

Thanks for any info.
