<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have several questions for those who currently have devices.  I am 
hoping you can answer.

     When listening to some of the messages you currently have posted 
like the message regarding Tesla, why is it that some come thru so 
very clear and audiable to understand vs. others?  Most of mine audio 
I have gotten from the boxes are very clear to hear outright.

      Second question?  In those who have tested it at a proposed 
location, have they ever gotten addition evp relating to the messages 
coming over the box?  The reason I asked is because I have.  When 
video taping the box being used, I got a warning of sorts prior to 
the message from the box.  Has anyone else experienced this?

      Third, has anyone ever gotten into a heated debate with someone 
over the box. A two way conversation that had the potential of 
getting nasty?  Or things that came across that were not nice?

I would love to know if anyone has experienced any of this events.

Thanks!
Juli</pre>
