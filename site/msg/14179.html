Exactly-ALWAYS save the original of everything. That way you can always go =
back.

        Which is why its al=
ways good to have the original to fall back on saved in better format. A bi=
t like "can't see the flowers for the trees" it depends on what viewpoint y=

          This is why wi=
th digital photos, you can't enlarge them without loosing resolution. You c=
an go smaller, but not larger.

          When you enlarge a digital photo,=
 the photo gets stretched, but the same amount of pixels have to now fill i=
n, so they get larger, which magnifies the pixelation. You end up with a bl=
ocky "lo-res" image. You can choose to have it "resample", but then you get=
 what RJ described, where the program looks at the existing pixels and add =
pixels that are an average of the surrounding pixels. So you still end up w=
hat a grainy, digital looking picture.

          When saving a photo to a =
compressed format, such as jpeg, you actually loose data, or pixels. The pr=
ogram decides which data to drop to make the file smaller. Each time you op=
en and resave, you loose more data.The resolution gets worse and worse.

  =
        This is the same thing that happens with audio files, you loose dat=
a each time you save it to a compressed format.

                  Pixelization doesn't=
 clean-up the data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a picture of a field of=
 flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixelization to the picture.  Soon=
, you would not be able to tell there were flowers there at all.  You would=
 see a lot of colored blocks.

                  Or in the other direction,=
 imagine you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on your sc=
reen: a complete screen of truely random static snow.  Pixelizing this, aft=
er a while, you would again start to see colored blocks.

                 =
 What's happening is that it is processing an area of the image, taking (fo=
r instance) the average value of that entire area, and replacing all the bl=
ocks in that area with the average.  In video processing, this would result=
 in a field of multi-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance, a big=
 greyish-bluish block, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise exampl=
e, it maybe replace all the random pixels with another big greyish-bluish b=
lock.  If you did not know beforehand what the original picture was, you co=
uldn't tell whether your pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a c=
hevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.

                  =
It works the same with the sound files.  Taking something as complex as spe=
ech, and replacing frequencies with their averages, loses the speech the fa=
rther you go, until you head strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the s=
ame to random static will eventually produce the same thing.  And random fl=
uctuating square waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, you could=
 have fun sharing with each other what you thing they 'sound like'.

                          I always save the whole file in wa=

                          As far as pixelization of non sounds/white noise =
whos to say that isnt being manipulated by them as well LOL. Water is a for=

                          Just a thought. Ok off to work now!=

                           Be a bit careful of formats like mp3 if you are =
doing a detailed analysis of the sounds though.   While some formats (like =
wav) can store the audio very close to the way it was recorded, formats lik=
e mp3 compress the file, and in so doing lose some of the sonic details.  T=
his may not be a big deal in music, where the audio is fairly clear to begi=
n with.  But with sound sources with a lot of noise (like evps), this can n=
ot only obscure any real sounds, but pixelize non-sounds (like white noise)=
 and make them start to sound like speech.

                               =
 So mp3 might be good for sharing the data, once you've already formed an o=
pinion based on an analysis of the wav file.  But mp3 is not good as a medi=
um for analysis.  It can lead to many false positives and misinterpretation=
s.

                  average value of that entire=
 area, and replacing all the

in a field of multi-colored

  sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.<BR><BR>It works

        the same with the sound files.  Taking something as 
         =
         complex as speech, and replacing frequencies with their 
         =
         averages, loses the speech the farther you go, until you head
