<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I know what you mean about the excitement. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of long nights 
working on something and not even realizing what time it was!

The good thing about my pcb making is that I can make as many or as few 
as I want. I&#x27;ve tried making them in batches, where I make maybe 4 at a 
time, and depending on the size of the board it can take the same amount 
of time as to make one.

A friend of mine got his hands on some &quot;experimental&quot; NiMH AA-size 
batteries that were supposed to be good for 3500 or 4000 mAh.  He said 
he was told they were a bit unstable and could possibly explode when 
being used. I guess that&#x27;s why they were experimental.  But once they get 
the bugs worked out, these might be a good source of power.

&gt; This might work and the price is right. I actaully have two boards I want to make, the sweep board, and the AM tuner board. Then I might want to make a complete board, tuner and all. I was working on a board made to fit a RS project box, so the sides taper slightly. I had to make two seprate boards, the sweep is on a smaller daughter board-both using perf board.
&gt;
&gt; I hate it when that excitement starts setting in! It usually means days without sleep.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, I don&#x27;t think I would want 30 of any given board, all at once anyway, but would want them available to others--they can order their own(?)
&gt;
&gt;  The next problem is power, using the AA-8 packs is kind of poor, sometimes they melt down, and the life isn&#x27;t long enough. 1.2ah gel cells are good, but pricy. $50 just for batteries. The boxes require a + and - supply, or two 12 volt batteries.
