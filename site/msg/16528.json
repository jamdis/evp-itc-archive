Also why it will never be scientifically proven, or stand up =\r\nagainst any tests.\n\nTo science, it will never be anything more then audible=\r\n pareidolia.\n\nI am not saying that&#39;s a bad thing Frank :)\n\n  ----- Original=\r\n Message ----- \n  From: Tom \n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursda=\r\ny, January 07, 2010 12:57 PM\n  Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: What does it do?\n\n\n  =\r\n  \n\n  The fact that the operator CAN and DOES make recordings and files of =\r\nunderstandable words and phrases shows that we are dealing with an OBJECTIV=\r\nE rather than a subjective phenomenon here. Two things appear to be going o=\r\nn though. \n  First there is an actual voice modulated signal. Different peo=\r\nple who listen to it often hear the same thing. The sound is not perfect an=\r\nd is very noisy, so that would explain others who cannot hear the message.\n=\r\n  The second thing is that some people can listen to the noise as a &quot;random=\r\n field&quot;, and with a slightly altered state of mind, this field will induce =\r\nlatent &quot;mediumship&quot; ability in the operator and he or she will get a lot mo=\r\nre information and voice material than another listener.\n\n  Note that the c=\r\nontent random fields have little or nothing in common with whatever imagery=\r\n or sounds may be percieved from them. They simply enhance the user to acce=\r\nss psychic information that, while even not being a &quot;psychic&quot; allows him to=\r\n get info normally innaccessable to him/her.\n  If there is any objective pe=\r\nrcieved sound similar to what is heard by others impressed upon the backgro=\r\nund noise, it might be due to the spirit who is speaking being PRESENT. Tha=\r\nt entity would then be able to get the message through to the operator Psyc=\r\nhicly on another level. that the words are also in the noise would be a co-=\r\nincidence.\n\n  I work with VISUAL random fields---The imagery, while clear, =\r\nis formed in my mind/eye system , so I cannot photograph it. Some of this E=\r\nVP background noise may be working the same way too---formed in the Mind/EA=\r\nR system. This is only heard by the primary operator and likely cannot be r=\r\necorded to a file. \n  But some random field stuff IS objective--for example=\r\n, using a random backdrop for ghost photos makes the ghosts easier to, and =\r\nmore often appear in a photo. This is equavalent to the EVP that people can=\r\n hear on the recorded file.\n\n  I will discuss and explain random field theo=\r\nry itself, later, in its own posting. \n\n  --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Z=\r\nack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt;\n  &gt; Just a guess, since I don&#39;t have a=\r\n lot of experience with this - probably\n  &gt; the mesages are meant for one u=\r\nser and it&#39;s best if one user listens at a\n  &gt; time.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; It could be t=\r\nhat some messages come through that are meant for multiple\n  &gt; users at onc=\r\ne.

I am not asking how it works. I \n  am&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; asking what you claim it does.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt=\r\n;&gt; For example, from your statements below, I get:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;The Frank&#39;s box allows entities to use FM and AM \n  radio =\r\nbroadcast as raw&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; material, which these enties select \n  an=\r\nd shape to communicate with the user.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The messages receive=\r\nd \n  are for the user, and rarely does anyone hear the same&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; thing \n  as the original listener.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Can=\r\n you be any \n  more specific as to what you mean by &#39;entities&#39;?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; Also, can \n  the user be defined as the person asking the box questio=\r\nns?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; \n  --- On *Thu, 1/7/10, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl=\r\n@ gmail.com&lt;&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http://mc/compose?to=3Dpurplealiengirl@...&quot;&gt;ht=\r\ntp://mc/compose?&lt;WBR&gt;to=3Dpurplealiengi&lt;WBR&gt;rl@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;* wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; From: \n=\r\n  Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ gmail.com&lt;&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http://mc/=\r\ncompose?to=3Dpurplealiengirl@...&quot;&gt;http://mc/compose?&lt;WBR&gt;to=3Dpurplealiengi=\r\n&lt;WBR&gt;rl@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Re: =\r\n[EVP-ITC] What does it do?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC=\r\n@yahoogroups .com&lt;&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http://mc/compose?to=3DEVP-ITC@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot;&gt;http://mc/compose?&lt;WBR&gt;to=3DEVP-ITC@&lt;WBR&gt;yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&gt; Date: Thursday, January 7, 2010, 9:35 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; It&#39;s a freaking \n  radio! The tuning is swept across the entire band, AM =\r\nor&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; FM, \n  the resulting bits of speech, music, and noise a=\r\nre used by the \n  enitites&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as a raw material to build thei=\r\nr voices from. The \n  sweep can be linear,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; random, or manu=\r\nal, and it does not have \n  to cover the entire broadcast band.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; This is one method and \n  device for providing the raw audio, and if =\r\nyou&#39;re&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; tesitng to \n  see if it&#39;s just broadcast fragments,=\r\n consider this-the concept&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&gt; is the same as EVPmaker, EVP=\r\nmaker runs on a computer, the \n  entities&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; manipulate that =\r\nraw audio *inside* the conmputer, \n  and if you think stray&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; RF is going to get *inside* the hard \n  drive and mix with the audio file=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you have no clue how any \n  technology works.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Testing is irrelavent! \n  It&#39;s not the device, it&#39;s =\r\nthe user. The messages&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; received are \n  for the user, and r=\r\narely does anyone hear the same thing as the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&gt; original l=\r\nistener.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; \n  You test it =\r\nby use, you judge it by what comes through and what it \n  means&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; to you, you can&#39;t play the sound snipets to a panel of \n  numbnuts(ob=\r\njective&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; listeners)) and expect to get an \n  unbiased/hones=\r\nt test. No two people hear&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the same, so an \n  &quot;objective l=\r\nistener&quot; is an insult to most people doing this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; \n  work.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I know, I&#39;m being harsh.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Frank-S&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; On Thu, \n  Ja=\r\nn 7, 2010 at 8:20 AM, rasterer &lt;rasterer@yahoo. com&lt;&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://mc/compose?to=3Drasterer@...&quot;&gt;http://mc/compose?&lt;WBR&gt;to=3Drasterer@&lt;WBR=\r\n&gt;...&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; H=\r\ney all, I&#39;ve seen lots \n  of people posting their perspectives and results&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and such \n  about the Frank&#39;s Box.
