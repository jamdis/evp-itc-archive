Has that ever happened before, where an entity is heard on two different people&#39;s boxes, and the people operating those boxes don&#39;t know each other?  \n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Assembly time is cut in half with the printed circuits boards, but it&#39;s\n&gt; still tedious. All resistors and non-electrolytic caps are surface mount.\n&gt; The wood box I picked up at the thrift store this afternoon for $1--had a\n&gt; feeling I should go check to see what they had. The previous TRF boards took\n&gt; 36 hours, just for the board, this one took 16. Then maybe an hour all\n&gt; togeter for the antenna, it has to be wound, then glued, then the turns\n&gt; adjusted for full band coverage.\n&gt; \n&gt;  At 10 seconds on --2 &quot;giant Earth quake&quot; and I heard that before I started\n&gt; recording as I was adjusting the tuning voltage.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Yeah, I know--I have all the fun---yea!\n&gt; \n&gt; Framl-S\n&gt;"}
