=A0 
Thanks so much, Misty. I will see if I can ask them to speak as one, b=
ecause I think you hit the nail right on the head -- I do hear them speakin=
g over each other, half in male, half in female, so maybe things would impr=
ove like you said if they organized into one collective voice. Can they sti=
ll answer questions about individuals this way, or are you limited to gener=
alized queries?

Regarding your statement: "Quite often when a new speaker
=
comes forth a bit of a training session can be heard for how they can
speak=
 so that my physical self can hear what is said." So by this, do you mean i=
t's possible it takes a couple of sessions for the entity to master this ne=
w method of communication? For instance, I got my grandmother' s name (amon=
g others) during Tuesday's session, but she said nothing, wouldn't answer o=
ur questions; Wednesday, she suddenly started talking and was the primary p=
erson we communicated with, even correctly answered my mother's questions a=
bout her childhood pets. Could this be because there's a learning curve inv=
olved with talking through the radio? Does it take a session or two before =
they "get the hang of it"? Or is it all dependent on my skills?

Oh, and wa=
nted to say I'm going out tomorrow to buy all the canned goods at the groce=
ry store in anticipation of the nuclear winter we are about to endure... Ju=
st kidding. Hearing about all that stuff they are predicting, it does make =
me wonder, though, why they would go to such trouble to tell you all that a=
gain and again -- what's to gain from it? It's not stirring anybody up.
