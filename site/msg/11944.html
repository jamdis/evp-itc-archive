<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The topic of Spiritualism came up, and I think it&#x27;s an important  
topic. I&#x27;m a Spiritualist. As a matter of fact, I will be in Lily  
Dale, NY (The Village of Spirits) at the end of Sept. for a workshop  
on Mediumship. Anyone want to join me? Come on Misty! Wouldn&#x27;t we have  
a blast? What a place to record.

Anyway, I mention Spiritualism as it&#x27;s practice has helped me in my  
research and due to the non-dogmatic structure, leaves my mind open to  
ponder without setting boundaries or labels on spirit. Spiritualism  
overseas is fabulous. Especially in the UK &amp; Ireland. The talk of such  
things is much more accepted and how I love that. No silly  
superstitious tags and spirit is greatly respected and paid attention  
to.

My dealings with Findhorn (in Scotland) have helped immensely in my  
understanding of the Elemental and Devic energies I&#x27;ve often been told  
I&#x27;m recording. Am I positive I&#x27;m recording these certain energies  
called Devas, Faeries, and Elementals? Nope. That&#x27;s just what they  
tell me. I&#x27;m told all sorts of things and always take them in stride.

Do I combine my Spiritualism with my EVP/ITC research? Nope. Not  
always, but sometimes. I like solid evidence that can be analyzed and  
scientific evidence. I like to be able to record something I can hand  
over on a brand new audio tape and have it analyzed or ask what the  
chances are that stray radio signals are calling out my name and  
answering my questions in real time. Or simply answer them with no  
radio at all - just a faucet trickling or no sound whatsoever.

What about others here? Do you combine your beliefs with your  
recording or stay completely scientific?
