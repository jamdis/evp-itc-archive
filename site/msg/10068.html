That is funny! I was thinking the same thing while listening to those recordings.
   
  In a box recording you can get an assemblance of male or female, and you can even get language accents. ie british, indian, spanish, etc...
   
  With the allophone/soap, you have one electroinic voice.
   
  So lets say you are recording, and like you said, you have two spirits speaking at the same time. happens quite a bit with box radio, how does the researcher discern who is talking. Even if the spirits say at the beginning that this is bobby sue or james, you can not tell the difference.
   
  Imagine if the allaphone voice sounded like HAL 9000!

I personnally dont like the robotic sounding voice with the 
soapsound. You can never tell whos talking everyone sounds the 
same.
