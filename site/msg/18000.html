Thanks for a great email John.

The reason I choose this method was 1) I di=
dn't think of yours, and 2) It seemed to accomplish the goal without requir=
ing others to learn or trust in anything new that sounds complex, or downlo=
ad a new program.

It would of course be possible to combine the methods: t=
hey could download the passworded jpg, and I could maintain an MD5 hash on =
the final file, and post that along with it.=C2=A0 That way, a person could=
 use the hash method if they chose, or download the file to their harddrive=
 and keep it under their control, accessing it at the end of the expierment=
.

I agree this is just a first version of the protocol, there will surely =
be bugs to be worked out and better ways to do things.=C2=A0 I appreciate y=
our (and anyone's) ideas, and will definitely keep them for future protocol=
 ideas.

      There is a good way to verify=
 a file irrespective of its contents without revealing the contents.
This t=
echnique is used in the software distribution business to ensure files have=
 not been
contaminated prior to or during a download.
=C2=A0
What you do is=
 make a 'digital hash' of the files contents. This renders a long hexadecim=
al
number which is reasonably unique and will change if the file or file co=
ntents are changed.
=C2=A0
The experimenter can then take a picture for exa=
mple, create the MD5 hash and send that
hash out as proof of the file's con=
tents, without revealing the picture content in this case.
=C2=A0
Later, on=
ce the picture is posted, anyone can run a similar hashing program against =
the
file to confirm they have the same file whose hash was posted by the ex=
perimenter 
originally. Hence you know what you see is a valid copy of the =
original (picture in this case).
=C2=A0
The software is available free on t=
he Internet. One example of many may be found at:
http://www.fileform at.in=
fo/tool/ hash.htm
=C2=A0
You don't even have to download it. Just click the=
 browse button to open a file on your
computer and the program displays a l=
arge variety of hashes including the MD5 hash.
This is one example of how t=
his could be done.
