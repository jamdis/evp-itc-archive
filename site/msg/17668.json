The tuner is from an Aiwa after market car stereo\nmade in 1998. It has/had built in secturity, which means I might not have\nbeen able to power up this radio. I bought it for $3 cuz I could see the\ntuner module pins were labeled, so it was a piece of cake to remove the\ntuner and mak it work. Car tuners are getting very few and far between in\nthe thrift stores, and worse at junk yards. This is what I started with in\nthe first boxes. It was Bill Chaple that &quot;discovered&quot; the hack radios, and I\nwas  like DAH!! you mean you can use other radios! I can be very dense--and\nnarrow.\n\n F-S\n\nMade his las nigh #80.
