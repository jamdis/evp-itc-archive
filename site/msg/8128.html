  Here is a good crystal for spirit communication. Even though you don't seem to have a bit of trouble with that........
   
  Apophyllite has been used to create a conscious connection between the physical form and the spiritual realm. It facilitates attunement to ones body as well as to the higher dimensional life forms. ... It has been used to facilitate astral travel.... Allows one to see into the future...the pyramids can be used to stimulate one's intuitive vision.

I get the impression, not necessarily from this group, that some think because I don't ask questions that the information is uselss. I think that's presumptuous and self centered. This is that LA1135 radio. The voices seem clearer with this box, I'm not sure why. This is the same chip in many of the car AM tuners. 
 
 I wanted to go to the metaphysical fair last weekend to get crystals, but ended up working, so I'll have to go to the mineral store.
