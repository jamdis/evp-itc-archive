She took lots of other photos. Digital camera.  When\nshe got back home and started going through them, she just couldn&#39;t\nbelieve her eyes on this one.  Now, I saw it on the camera, still on\nthe media card myself. I know that my niece doesn&#39;t have the computer\nskills to photoshop this. To me, it appears that she caught a pic of a\nfairy/sprite, or &quot;elemental&quot; of some kind.\n\nIt&#39;s one of the most fascinating and intriguing pictures I&#39;ve ever seen.\n\n~ Becca"}
