And run-of-the-mill stomach bugs won&#39;t be\naccompanied by respiratory symptoms, notes Dr. Wayne Reynolds of Newport\nNews, Va., spokesman for the American Academy of Family Physicians.&quot; \n----- Original Message ----- From: Rj To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com Sent:\nMonday, April 27, 2009 3:11 PMSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Asked about Niburu\n&gt; The US has not reported any swine flu fatalities yet.  That doesn&#39;t\nmean there won&#39;t be any.  But the reason that so far that flu has been\nless serious in the US is speculated to be due to better treatment and\nearlier prevention.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Mon, 4/27/09, Frank Sumption purplealiengirl@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Frank Sumption purplealiengirl@...\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Asked about Niburu\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Monday, April 27, 2009, 2:07 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Curiously--- it seems like it&#39;s only fatal to Mexicans---hmmmm, could\nold Unlce Sam be trying an imigration solution.
