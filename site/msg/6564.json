Then if you want pe=\r\nople to get special notices you can add them as members by email or add as =\r\nfriends thru esnips. Make the folders/files public access and its open to t=\r\nhe esnips community (theres quite a few over there) as well as the group fo=\r\nrum here. You just say here you posted your files same as you always do and=\r\n give the link and they can go and check them out even if its a 50 meg file=\r\n. \nIt&#39;s pretty cool and it has alot of options. We use it to post ITC pictu=\r\nres and share big EVP collections or just keep up with some of the massive =\r\namount of results each other gets. \n \nIts better than alot of pay services =\r\nIve seen, and the fact that its free just makes it that much better. Alot o=\r\nf people are not computer saavy. But I simply email them the link, and when=\r\n they click on it and visit my gallery or whatever I have set up for them t=\r\no view, they automatically just verified thier email account is real. So th=\r\nen when they decide to join the signup is instant and they can begin the pr=\r\nocess of uploading immediately. It makes it so much easier for them to figu=\r\nre out how to do things.\n \nYour folder options are endless. You can make on=\r\ne for each box, and then make subfolders that are dated in each one. It all=\r\nows descriptions or comments for each file.\n \nI used it to highlight differ=\r\nent methods of recording and I didnt even come close to covering them all. =\r\nThis group has alot of methods going on, we just need more file space to sh=\r\nare them.

O=\r\nne solution is to post Mp3 files instead of Wav. files or any other format.=\r\n It seems like the Mp3&#39;s sound the same and are only 1/10th of the size. I =\r\nthink that would probably clear up 90 percent of the board right there. If =\r\ni actually have more than a couple files from here on out, i will be attach=\r\ning them to an e-mail and not the board to save space here. And also, if pe=\r\nople do post files maybe we can all just have one post that says we have up=\r\nloaded files to our folder instead of 30 audio announcements in a row that =\r\njust seems to waste a lot of e-mail space in the individual e-mails. And it=\r\n also pushes the current topic on the board to another page and is lost for=\r\n those who wanted to share. Just my thoughts on helping the subject. I know=\r\n we are all excited, but misty is right. I went to add a file the other day=\r\n and the group was at 93 percent capacity, so it won&#39;t be long before we ru=\r\nn out of space.-Steve H.--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, &quot;Misty&quot; &lt;bulletbab=\r\nea@ ...&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Just a little friendly reminder that you all need to orga=\r\nnize your &gt; files better in the files area.

I don&#39;t know the &lt;BR&gt;technical aspects of the =\r\nfile &lt;BR&gt;&gt; change but I think it&#39;s common sense that when you try to pou=\r\nr a &lt;BR&gt;gallon of water into a shot glass&lt;BR&gt;&gt; all you wind up with is a=\r\n shot glass full of water the rest is &lt;BR&gt;spilled and lost.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; I keep my files posted for 5 or less days, just long enough for &lt;BR&gt;anyon=\r\ne that wants to listen can.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If your going to leave your files poste=\r\nd indefinitely and keep &lt;BR&gt;adding to the folder then of course it will&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; put pressure on the storage space.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As far as posting =\r\na notice for every file, some of us may wish to &lt;BR&gt;listen from their e-mai=\r\nl or not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; have to go to the file section to listen, That&#39;s probably=\r\n why that &lt;BR&gt;option is given.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If I didn&#39;t like the notices clutter=\r\ning up my e-mail in box you can &lt;BR&gt;change that feature in the group&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; membership options. So if anyone does not want that feature they &lt;BR&gt;can =\r\nturn it off and only read posts on the group.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It&#39;s not the=\r\n lack of space is the mismanagement of it by all of us. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; when I cha=\r\nnge my files from wav. to mp3 I hear a distinct &lt;BR&gt;difference, do it in an=\r\n audio editor and you can visually see the &lt;BR&gt;difference.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Bruce&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bruce Halliday &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: w=\r\narrior18eii@&lt;WBR&gt;...: Wed, 30 Jan 2008 05:05:37 -&lt;BR&gt;0800Subject: Re: [EVP-=\r\nITC] Re: **Special Notice Regaurding Your Group &lt;BR&gt;Membership**&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; That&#39;s a great idea Ste=\r\nve and it was mentioned before but either no &lt;BR&gt;one noticed Misty&#39;s post o=\r\nr it was ignored.

One solution is to post =\r\nMp3 files instead of &lt;BR&gt;Wav. files or any other format. It seems like the =\r\nMp3&#39;s sound the &lt;BR&gt;same and are only 1/10th of the size. I think that woul=\r\nd probably &lt;BR&gt;clear up 90 percent of the board right there. If i actually =\r\nhave more &lt;BR&gt;than a couple files from here on out, i will be attaching the=\r\nm to an &lt;BR&gt;e-mail and not the board to save space here. And also, if peopl=\r\ne do &lt;BR&gt;post files maybe we can all just have one post that says we have &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;uploaded files to our folder instead of 30 audio announcements in a &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nrow that just seems to waste a lot of e-mail space in the individual &lt;BR&gt;e-=\r\nmails. And it also pushes the current topic on the board to another &lt;BR&gt;pag=\r\ne and is lost for those who wanted to share. Just my thoughts on &lt;BR&gt;helpin=\r\ng the subject. I know we are all excited, but misty is right. I &lt;BR&gt;went to=\r\n add a file the other day and the group was at 93 percent &lt;BR&gt;capacity, so =\r\nit won&#39;t be long before we run out of space.-Steve H.--- &lt;BR&gt;In EVP-ITC@yah=\r\noogroups .com, &quot;Misty&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@ ...&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Just &lt;BR&gt;a l=\r\nittle friendly reminder that you all need to organize your &gt; files &lt;BR&gt;b=\r\netter in the files area. Space is limited here and you are all &gt; &lt;BR&gt;nea=\r\nring the 100% mark so try to keep your section under 5 megs. If &gt; &lt;BR&gt;yo=\r\nu need more space use www.esnips.com and you can store 50 gigs to &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nshare with the group or public.&gt; &gt; I think it is great you guys have =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;so much to share I just wish that &gt; our yahoo group wasnt so limited=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;on space (and that I wasnt so &gt; limited on time). But I have found =\r\na &lt;BR&gt;way around it. If just a few &gt; people signed up and shared using &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;esnips they can invite others to &gt; visit thier files and once they do=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;they also get 50 gigs of free &gt; space for audio pictures or video o=\r\nr &lt;BR&gt;whatever you want to post.&gt; &gt; I was considering setting up &lt;BR&gt;=\r\none &quot;group&quot; account to start with and &gt; inviting all members who post &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;files to join it and be able to post to &gt; the account. It will &lt;BR&gt;aut=\r\nomatically notify everyone thats a member &gt; when a file is added &lt;BR&gt;to =\r\nit just like the yahoo group does. It also &gt; allows you to share &lt;BR&gt;wit=\r\nh the public or privately if you so choose. &gt; You can even allow &lt;BR&gt;you=\r\nr friends to post to your account if you wish.&gt; &gt; This group has &lt;BR&gt;=\r\ngrown and expanded and we just need to make a few &gt; changes to how we &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;do things to keep it running more smoothly for the &gt; future. I am &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nhoping that you all will help me in this endeavor. I &gt; know many of &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nyou have already adapted the idea to help us organize &gt; and maintain &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;the group.&gt; &gt; I want you to keep sharing and to be able to share &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;more! &gt; &gt; So please organize and not post stray files that are &lt;BR&gt;t=\r\nargets for &gt; deletion once the que is 100% full.
