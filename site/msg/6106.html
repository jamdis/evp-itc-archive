<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce, these are pretty amazing. I&#x27;m not sure if you have listened to
known recordings of her voice, but some of the responses even sound
like her! I listened to her at length in Atlanta, then had a 45 minute
conversation with her afterwards and she had a distinctive voice I
feel I&#x27;m recognizing here. -Bill

&gt; hey everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I had a really terrific session recently and posted a bunch of files. I 
&gt; hope you guy&#x27;s don&#x27;t get bored listening 99% of them are great.
&gt; 
&gt; I received 5 concerning Sarah  Estep and believe a couple where Sarah 
&gt; herself.
&gt; 
&gt; Also got one Claiming to be St. Patrick.
&gt; 
&gt; I labeled a couple with explanations, something new to explain what the 
&gt; file is about.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you guy&#x27;s can give a listen these files are really good.
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce
