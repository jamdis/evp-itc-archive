I know I haven&#x27;t faked or doodledaddled with any audio of any recordings
I&#x27;ve made, but how do you prove that fact to someone else?

&gt; Everyone has their own assumptions, expectations, and subjectivity.
&gt; Scientists realize this, and that is why they use the scientific method: to
&gt; control for their own human predispositions.
&gt;
&gt; On your advice, I read more of her articles.  The one on EVPS: (
&gt; http://www.hauntedamericatours.com/EVP/EVP/) does show her presumptions,
&gt; and she  presents many of the issues and potentials for &quot;false positives&quot;
&gt; that I assume all experienced EVP researchers already know of.   But she
&gt; also comments to the claims: &quot;My response to this is…provide the evidence! &quot;
&gt;
&gt; So that would seem to me she would be open to a well-designed test to &quot;show
&gt; her the evidence&quot;.  So I will contact her, suggest this sort of test, and
&gt; even suggest that experts from this group would help to design and conduct
&gt; the test - maybe even Frank - and let you know what she says.

&gt; Nothing. But scientific methodology implies not assuming anything - not
&gt; assuming the presence or absence of anything paranormal.
&gt;
&gt; If you read this woman&#x27;s blogs, she&#x27;s already assumed there&#x27;s nothing there
&gt; before even beginning to test things.

&gt;&gt;  I was lead to believe this person had an interset in the box, and she
&gt;&gt; brought her &quot;boyfirend&quot; that just happen to be local, to our meeting the
&gt;&gt; other day. I let them &quot;barrow&quot; #63, now  I&#x27;m sure she will claim she tested
&gt;&gt; the box &quot;scientifically, and can prove it does not work.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Karen had contacted me via e-mail requesting a meeting. I thought she was
&gt;&gt; someone off the group and has an interest in EVP and the boxes. She did
&gt;&gt; mention she was a skeptic, but I didn&#x27;t think debunker, or a professional
&gt;&gt; skeptic--wonder who pays these twits?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  These skeptics don&#x27;t allow themselves to hear anything, yet will proclaim
&gt;&gt; that as proof the boxes and EVP don&#x27;t work, as if their hearing is somehow
&gt;&gt; better than the average persons ear. If a person doesn&#x27;t want to hear it,
&gt;&gt; they won&#x27;t, and because they can&#x27;&#x27;t hear EVP that means no one else an
&gt;&gt; either.  Yeah, real scientific!
