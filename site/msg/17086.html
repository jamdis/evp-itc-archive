Greetings,
 
Did you all get a chance to hear my file,  Smoking yet?  Don't let the 
title fool you, because it is really a long  one, partly me talking, and them 
answering, even though it's title is short,  it's actually a long file.  I 
finally figured out how to convert to MP  format with the Gold Wave 
program.daaa, nobody's perfect!  When you  have heard my new files, I will be removing 
them, so I can upload more new ones  I got last Friday.  If no one is 
interested please let me know, and I won't  upload them as it's time consuming.  I 
hear all your files, and I  think they are great!  What we've been given 
here is a great  blessing.SF
