<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There is always some duffus that somehow knows better, ignores all evidence and everyone else&#x27;s results, and claims there has been no advancement, based on what, his head burried in the goddamn sand!? Desregard the fact that rooms full of people hear the same frikin&#x27; thing from a box, and call it mind matixing, they must be all imagining it. Ignore the fact that many get questions answered with verifiable information, ignore the fact that the boxes often name the people present. Yeah, these clowns that pop every month ignore all facts, and quote all this pseudo science BS about how we are all so stupid that we just hear imaginary voices from the boxes and all EVP methods. Plus imply that only lunatics only hear voices. 
 There is more than enough &quot;proof&quot; for EVP, we don&#x27;t and will not rehash it over and over hin this group. We won&#x27;t spend endless discussion on old BS that was piss poor at best. The purpose here to promote new methods, and try new ideas, and demonstrate what we get. For those that don&#x27;t like, I have the banned button. 

 Not only that, EVPmaker often works better for me, and that was invented back in 1980s, and yet his clown insists there is nothing new. Check your facts, and I am not even trying to be nice, 11 of years of these skeptic debunkers is too much.
