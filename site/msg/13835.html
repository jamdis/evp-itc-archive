Your test is subjective in that i=
t is based on just your influence. Therefore, all we can test with it is yo=
ur influence on the board. Add a few more people to the study, then we can =
objectify it a little more.

In the second paragraph, the test you outlined=
 with testing the 2 people, is not subjective, because you have more then j=

"M=

Not at all. I do not ha=
ve any opinion either way if the board can or can't be psychically influenc=
e, because I do not know. I do think the board can be tested for certain th=
ings. I just don't think your test using just you would tell us much in the=

        Asking the board open-ended quest=
ions, and interpreting the results, is subjective. Asking for a specific, p=
redetermined number is not subjective.  It is about as objective as you can=
 get. 

        I am not trying to prove anything, or rule out any possibil=
ities.  I am suggesting a method to determine, statistically, how accurate =
someone=E2=80=99s board, or methodology, might be.  Lets say I select two p=
eople, and in separate rooms, I give each a spelling test.  Person 1 gets 1=
00% right.  Person 2 gets 50% right.  Now, if I later give them a second sp=
elling test, I can start with the theory that Person 1 will get near 100% c=
orrect, and Person 2 will get near 50% correct.  This doesn=E2=80=99t mean =
they will, or that they have gotten these scores in the past.  But statisti=
cally, it is a reasonable assumption at this point.  After the second test,=
 I can examine the deviation of the results from the first test, and update=
 the statistics.   If the deviation remains small (if the results remain si=
milar), then I can more and more safely assume that person 1 will have a ve=
ry high chance of getting a word right, and person 2 will have half that.  =
If the deviation swings wildly, than my statistics may not be very predicti=
ve after all.

        The same is true with the board.  As you said, getti=
ng this number wrong doesn=E2=80=99t say past answers were wrong, or that f=
uture answers will be wrong.  And it is possible it could have been right b=
y mere chance (though very unlikely: winning the lottery is more likely tha=
n guessing one number out of a billion).  What we=E2=80=99d have is one sin=
gle objective data point.  It gives a starting point for reasonable assumpt=
ions.  As you noted, after more such tests, those assumptions may start cha=
nging.  It would be interesting to see how they change, if they do.

      =
  Different people seem to have different feelings about the board.  Some b=
elieve it gives great results.  Some are suspicious, even dubious.  And the=
re are plenty of opinions in between.  My test is not for those who believe=
 it is statistically likely that psychic tampering would occur, or that the=
 board=E2=80=99s performance is just not testable, which is the camp I gath=
er you are in.  My test is only good for that segment of this population wh=
o believes or wonders if the board is capable of giving a straight objectiv=
e answer to a straight objective questions, and that such performance is te=
stable.  To address one of your examples, while it cannot show that an enti=
ty is reading my mind if it gets the numbers right, it can conversely show =
that an actual entity is not reading my mind (or that it is not performing =
remote viewing, or that it is not predicting the future of what the right a=
nswer is when it is revealed, or that it is not being forthright in its ans=
wers) if it cannot get the numbers right in the first place.  But if these =
things are true, then it begs the question of its accuracy anyway.

       =
 So again, this is one data point, in what could be a number of tests, for =
those who are not ruling out that testing is possible, and even desirable, =
when believing, or acting on, information gathered by using this kind of bo=
ard.

          It's not that I=
 don't want to test it, it is that I can't. It would be interesting and I w=
ould do it if I could.

          But again, this test could really only ru=
le out psychic interference from you. It is too subjective and therefore ca=
nnot stand as a measurement for other tests of this nature by itself.

    =
      If it failed to get your number, that would not mean that it couldn't=
 get someone else's number or that someone else couldn't influence it. That=
 would also not mean that answers it had gotten in the past weren't correct=
, coming from a living being or a spirit.  It would not prove anything, exc=
ept that it was not acting on any psychic vibrations from you personally.

=
          If it got your number correct, that doesn't even help immediately=
, because it could get the answer on mere chance.

          The only way t=
o prove here that it is being psychically influenced would be to run severa=
l tests of the same nature. Then, if it scored correct higher then mere cha=
nce, only then could you say that the board can be psychically tampered wit=
h. Still, that is the only thing you could say for certain. That would not =
rule out the possibility that spirits can communicate through it.

        =
   So we would be left with more questions. Is it that it is being psychica=
lly tampered with by a human mind directly? Is it and actual entity reading=
 someone's mind? Can it be both?

          See what I am sayin'?

                  If you don't want to test it, I understand=

        assumptions may start changing.  It would b=
e interesting to see how 
        they change, if they do.<BR><BR>Different=
 people seem to have different 
        feelings about the board.  Som=
e believe it gives great 
        results.  Some are suspicious, even =
dubious.  And there are 
        plenty of opinions in between.  =
My test is not for those who 
        believe it is statistically likely th=
at psychic tampering would occur, 
        or that the board=E2=80=99s perf=
ormance is just not testable, which is the camp 
        I gather you are i=
n.  My test is only good for that segment of this 
        population =
who believes or wonders if the board is capable of giving a 
        straig=
ht objective answer to a straight objective questions, and that 
        su=
ch performance is testable.  To address one of your examples, 
       =
 while it cannot show that an entity is reading my mind if it gets the 
   =
     numbers right, it can conversely show that an actual entity is not 
  =
      reading my mind (or that it is not performing remote viewing, or that=
 it 
        is not predicting the future of what the right answer is when =
it is 
        revealed, or that it is not being forthright in its answers)=
 if it 
        cannot get the numbers right in the first place.  But =
if these 
        things are true, then it begs the question of its accurac=
y 
        anyway.<BR><BR>So again, this is one data point, in what could b=
e a 
        number of tests, for those who are not ruling out that testing=
 is 
        possible, and even desirable, when believing, or acting on, in=
formation 
        gathered by using this kind of board.  <BR><BR><BR>=
