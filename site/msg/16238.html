    Just because "Science" =

 for sure it was my dad's friend. But I find it hard to believe that entiti=
es on the other side who are not dead people would go to so much trouble to=
 impersonate my dead friends and relatives -- why bother? If they truly see=

  because my great uncle has been coming through a lot, and he was mur=
dered in 
  1942. Since I wasn't born until decades later, I never knew him=
, but I do 
  understand that people come through we did not know in life. =
Has anyone else 
  contacted someone claiming to have lived that far back? =
Or in another lifetime
