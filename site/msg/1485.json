It&#39;s not so much evolution, it&#39;s using what I have, like the scrap \npiece of aluminum for the panel. The next &quot;evolution&quot; will be the printed \ncircuit board. Of course I keep adding functions, which means more board \nreal estate, which raises costs. I really want the linear sweep, and tone \ninjection to be standard functions. It would be interesting to use all \nstereo speakers, and mics in the echo boxes, but that almost doubles the \ncomponents again. I&#39;ve thought about a stripped down version, like just the \ntuner and sweep generator, then use something like a boom box for the all \nthe audio and recording functions. If it was only linear sweep, the system \ncould be made on a small board===cheap.\n\nFrank-S\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Another &quot;boring&quot; weekend.\n&gt;Date: Mon, 09 Jul 2007 16:16:23 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;The evolution continues.... nice cabinet face design Frank. -Bill\n&gt;--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The boards aren&#39;t wired in yet, but it&#39;s getting there!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; http://newlivehotmail.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nhttp://im.live.com/messenger/im/home/?source=hmtextlinkjuly07"}
