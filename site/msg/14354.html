n the "tomorrow let you know" EVP, I do hear something....just can't be sur=

 background noise. There is no way for me to tell for certain as it is just=
 too feint. I can't make out any clear words. Sure-I could probably matrix =

itive of spirit communication by the community at large, it has to be clear=
 enough that many people hear the same thing, without hints or coaxing. If =
you have to have high quality devices to make it out, it just isn't good en=
ough. That does not mean it isn't a true EVP, just that it isn't good enoug=
h to stand as evidence. As for the whistle, it sounded like feedback to me =
as well, but I will have to take you word for it that you were no where nea=

prove anything scientifically, unless you want others to completely believe=

 you were 
  no where near any other electronics or EMF's that could contri=

it isn't personal. You have to
