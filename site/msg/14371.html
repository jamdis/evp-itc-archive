Not to get all religious but do you folks have a prayer to say for some of  
these people?  It must be that The Man Upstairs has given us all a job to  
do here, that's probably the reason He has allowed these groups to hear the  
other side.  :>/ or something. sf

You could pray for that female spirit. Sometimes just knowing that  they 
are not be alone helps.

One last question before I got to bed after 1am :) What are those noises  
often heard before or after an EVP? I have found quite a few voices that I  
wouldn't have noticed hadn't I first heard a "pop" sound. Actually had to do  
some MAJOR enhancing on 2 of them to even hear them at all. I mean one was  
impossibly buried in the noise. But after slowing it down I got a "wiff" of 
 it, and through more passes of the Audacity effects I was rewarded with a  
female voice. It was sad though...she said in a mechanical pattern "can - 
you  - help- me.........please - help. Still, the audio is so painfully low.  
Hearing her plea will forever effect me. Hopefully I can find someoneone 
here  that can hear them as well as I. That can verify this for me :) I hear  
it...but is nice to know someone else is there with you :) I went back to 
that  location little over an hour later (after found the voice) Is under 1 
mile  from me. It's a real sad thing to hear and not knowing what to do.Jim H
