By the way, this radio and circuit is running on a 9v supply.\n\nS-H\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Urkel23&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I originally sent this video to Jeff, but i thought it would be cool to share it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically, it shows what i do while building a circuit.  The voltage from the radio from one end of the band to the other is roughly 2v-9v, so the goal is to make a sweep circuit to match what the radio puts out.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can see in this video, that i got the radio to sweep between 2v-7v.  That means it&#39;s covering more than 3/4 of the bandwidth, which is excellent.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been testing different versions of this circuit, but couldn&#39;t get it to come close until today.\n&gt; \n&gt; This stuff is NOT easy to build, especially how frank does it.  I&#39;m focusing mainly on the circuit, but frank build everything from scratch with the exception of maybe the tuner.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think you will find the video interesting.  The yellow box is my multimeter, it shows me what the circuit is doing.  You can do the same thing with a scope.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Alhi_hze5L8\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; S-H\n&gt;"}
