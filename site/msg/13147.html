<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Mike, Is this going to be something you sell or something that can

What Youtube videos of yours can i see now? 

Thanks,

Richard

&gt; Richard, Misty, and all other fellow researchers,
&gt; 
&gt; This is a fasinating topic, one that I am currently most interested 
&gt; with as my latest experiment/research project is all about.
&gt; The crash debris that was sent to 8 researchers, I believe, does hold 
&gt; imprints from a violent past.
&gt; As does the area where the original crash happened, since there are 
&gt; still amounts of debris scattered around the immediate area, as well 
&gt; as beneath the surface where now stands a memorial.  Not to mention 
&gt; it is the last place where living humans were quickly lost.  Just 
&gt; imagine the amount of energy that must be imprinted on that exact 
&gt; spot.
&gt; 
&gt; That is where I hoped to gain a better understanding of that energy 
&gt; which is imprinted... and I must say, I think I have done just that.
&gt; 
&gt; Today I processed a number of the files I captured from the impact 
&gt; point using numerous devices of the non-microphone type.  After I put 
&gt; each of these files through a four step process (which I&#x27;ll explain 
&gt; in great detail in my video), I was able to listen to some amazing, 
&gt; and very relivent sounds.
&gt; My wife was so upset after I told her what I had heard, she refused 
&gt; to listen to the audio.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me just say... the combination I used was able to capture a very 
&gt; chilling scene.  One I just have to believe were the last moments of 
&gt; those who perished.
&gt; 
&gt; Once I publish the final results, I hope others will be able to 
&gt; verify what I am hearing...
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m figuring to put a multi-part video on my Youtube page.  One part 
&gt; explaining what will be seen an heard, as well as describing the 
&gt; events of that day.  Another part with my sessions at the various 
&gt; locations, using various methods.  And a final part with the audio of 
&gt; the researchers who assisted with this experiment using the debris I 
&gt; sent each of them.
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line... I really do believe that energy is imprinted in 
&gt; objects, and at locations where energy was strong at a time of 
&gt; imprint.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy Holidays to all.... have a safe and fun Holiday Season!

&gt; &gt; Richard,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thats a great example and a good way to look at things. the old 
&gt; idea 
&gt; &gt; that energy doesnt die its just transformed holds true with that 
&gt; too. 
&gt; &gt; I have seen the same thing done with missing appendages, tho a 
&gt; finger 
&gt; &gt; may have been removed it still registers under kirlian photography 
&gt; as 
&gt; &gt; its energy being present.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Just because we dont see something or hear a thing doesnt mean it 
&gt; is 
&gt; &gt; nonexistant =) Perhaps it just means we are deaf and blind to its 
&gt; &gt; existence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for replying to my message.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Years ago I watched a slide show featuring several photo&#x27;s taken 
&gt; via
&gt; &gt; &gt; kirlian photography. It seems kirlian photography captures certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; types of energy on film. In the demonstration a picture of a 
&gt; house 
&gt; &gt; was
&gt; &gt; &gt; shown. Later that same house had a fire and part of the house had 
&gt; &gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; burned to the ground but the photo taken with kirlian photography
&gt; &gt; &gt; later showed that part of the house still there.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m no expert but maybe energy we can&#x27;t see leaves an imprint in 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; non physical universe and can be viewed or demonstrated using the
&gt; &gt; &gt; right instruments and technique. Of course I really have no clue 
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; am fascinated by the evp and itc phenomena.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Enjoyed visiting your site, thanks for the link.
