How about the heater, fan, air conditioning or dehumidifer switching on or =

  These were electrical surges. The only

  Yes we logged all readings. We were 
  reading EMF, so a bit of bo=

    What I have been hearing on this since the first posting i=
s a 
    single
tap that sounds like wood on wood. Since the tapping was

   continual
and you noticed an EM spike there is another 
    possibility.=


You could have detected a PK event. In poltergeist cases 
    we have com=
e
to realize that living PK agents often are responsible. 
    These agents=

function in environments with specific characteristics and 
    themselves=

exhibit specific traits. One of the environmental 
    characteristics is
=
an elevated magnetic field. Often this is a 
    geomagnetic field as seems=

to be the case in extreme poltergeist cases. 
    Less extremem cases, 
su=
ch as this may be, we often see elevated EM field 
    levels. Do your
read=
ings in your notes? Were you reading electrical or 
    magnetic
fields? Wh=
at type of EMF meter were you using? This might 
    help
determine if the =
info you noticed was potentially related to 
    PK
effects.
