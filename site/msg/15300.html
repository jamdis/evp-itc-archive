<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, all the boxes are complete and ready for use.  I started with the joe&#x27;s box and continue to get good communication from it.

Here is a link to my web page with some samples to the joe&#x27;s box.  I will part with anything but my frank&#x27;s boxes, but all methods do work.

&gt; Are these the completed boxes ready for use? My mom passed May 2008 and I want to contact her again. Have you heard anything with the Joe&#x27;s box? If so and if the sounds is good quality I will buy it from you. - Elaine

&gt; 
&gt; I bought a couple extra 12-587 radios today and hacked them, so i can offer them
&gt; to the group to those who are having a hard time finding them.
&gt; 
&gt; They were like $32 with tax plus whatever shipping cost to your location would
&gt; be. I also have other boxes for sale:
&gt; 
&gt; RS 12-587----$32 plus shipping-(Actual Cost of unit)
&gt; 
&gt; MiniBox Plus----$400 plus shipping-(I paid $550 originally)
&gt; 
&gt; Joe&#x27;s Box----$150. 00-(I paid $250 originally)
&gt; 
&gt; MiniBox 2----$150
&gt; 
&gt; Let me know if anyone is interested in any or all of the boxes, i need to free
&gt; up some space in my home and am offer them at a discounted rate. I rarely have
&gt; time to use all of these, so they must go. I figured that i would offer the
&gt; group first before putting them on Ebay.
