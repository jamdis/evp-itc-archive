 In the future, I suggest no one forward material from another site, or bl=
og to the group. It's just to save feelings, and embarrassment, and it's no=
t appropriate.
 
 All should be careful of using other researchers names wh=
en being critical.
 
 If anyone is getting threats of "legal action", I sug=
gest it be reported to the FBI, so at least a pattern can be established. I=
'm pretty sure most of this stuff comes from out of a persons home state, t=
hat makes it federal. Slander is not even applicable to the internet, so th=
reats of slander suits are harrassment to keep people from contradicting ce=
rtain claims and research in this field, and as such, criminal. Although th=
ese criminals think they can say whatever they want about the rest of us. I=
 suggest just let it go, and let the evidence speak for itself. 
 
 These p=
eople that would like to keep all this research private, and for their own =
use are in fact in this group. To keep them off I would have to make this a=
 private group, or no group at all, and that's not fair to the world. As I =
find out who these people are, that are in the groop under false pretenses,=
 they will be banned. 
 
 If I feel threatened, or intimidated again, I wil=
l take appropriate action, and it won't involve whinning!  I can grow a pai=
r even at my age!
