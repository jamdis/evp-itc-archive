They came thru quite clearly even tho they had \nsome difficulty making the link to where I was tuned off station in \nthe &quot;dead&quot; zone. I usually start and end my sweep sessions off station \nbut they had been coming thru quite clear there so last night I did the \nentire session that way. As always Tony was there to lend a hand.\n\nhttp://www.esnips.com/web/directradiovoice\n\nFor those who have any difficulty playing the files try downloading \nthen playing.\n\nMisty"}
