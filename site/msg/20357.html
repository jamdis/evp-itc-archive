&gt; maybe it&#x27;s your font lol maybe if it wasn&#x27;t sooo bold.  this is the first time that I have responded to anything in this group and I felt like I was being yelled at, but that&#x27;s my opinion.
&gt; Have a good night

&gt; That&#x27;s the one thing that keeps me wondering about this 2012 thing... the fact that it&#x27;s a multicultural prophecy. That&#x27;s a little harder to ignore.

&gt; &gt; That prediction is world wide, almost every culture, it&#x27;s in the bible
&gt; &gt; code, wormwood of revelations. It dates back to ancient Sumeria. If it was
&gt; &gt; Mayan only, it could easily be ignored.

&gt; &gt; &gt; oh, most certainly life is forever, just in different form. I just had it
&gt; &gt; &gt; in my mindset that the mayans forgot that blasted clock when they left,
&gt; &gt; &gt; lol. I hope that the spirits are wrong on this
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for putting me a little bit at ease :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, keep in mind that just because it comes out of spirit communcation
&gt; &gt; &gt; doens&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s 100%. Besides, what we are pretty sure of with EVP is life
&gt; &gt; &gt; is forever, not dependent on the physical environment.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hello Frank, I just want to say how scary this is - that a comet is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; coming and there is nothing to do about it.
