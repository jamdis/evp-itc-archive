<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I didn&#x27;t intend for either to be ominous.  I just think we don&#x27;t know who 
we&#x27;re really comunicating with through the boxes.  It could be space 
aliens for all we know. They definitely don&#x27;t sound like the EVP&#x27;s I&#x27;ve 
gotten in haunted places. They are in a class by themselves. Maybe we&#x27;ll 
know for sure some day.

As for the loved ones, I personally think they hang around for the 
funeral, then they&#x27;re off into a new baby body as fast as they can go. The 
ones who hang around and become ghosts are probably in the less than 1% 
category of people who do that. The rest are growing up with new parents 
somewhere and getting to believe in Santa Claus (or whatever) again.

&gt;&gt; evil.
&gt;&gt; Good and evil / Light &amp; darkness can not exist in the same space. You can&#x27;t 
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt; one without the other. Negativity will always be overpowered by Good &amp; 
&gt;&gt; darkness
&gt;&gt; will always be illuminated by the light.  Negative entities will try to lie 
&gt;&gt; and / or mislead?
&gt;&gt; You can&#x27;t always know who your dealing with, but that&#x27;s part of the 
&gt;&gt; investigating process,
&gt;&gt; isn&#x27;t it?  Asking &amp; Trying to determine who your dealing with?

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; That  sounds quite ominous, Zack. Not sure I like the sound of it. What is 
&gt;&gt; your theory?

&gt;&gt;&gt; We actually don&#x27;t know who we&#x27;re communicating with using the boxes. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; suspect it isn&#x27;t what we traditionally call a &quot;ghost&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I also suspect that people are not hearing their loved ones. The loved
&gt;&gt;&gt; oneshave probably been elsewhere for some time ...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I personally have seen Chris use his box in public forum four times.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have heard the box give audible yes and no type answers to peoples
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; questions. I do feel though that the ones that get emotionally moved
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the most are the ones wanting with all their heart to hear from a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; loved one. When these people get an answer that may or may not be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heard by all, they feel that it is indeed from a loved one and it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hits them in the heart as if it was real. I would love to hear a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recorded session from start to finish as an investigator. After all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this research is for all not just &quot;30&quot;.... :-)
