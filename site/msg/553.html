&gt; Here are a few from the sessions I did today. Some involved 
musical background noise hubby had playin loud (spirit in the sky 
was the song so I pressed record to see what I&#x27;d get LOL) then later 
did a session with the usual water/fan bg noise.
&gt;    
&gt;   All in all I pulled out 34 or so evp&#x27;s. Some were pretty clear 
for me, some were fuzzy as usual. It was a pretty good connection, I 
asked questions and they answered. Not going to post what I asked, 
nor am I going to post all the answers I got but I will share some 
of what came thru.
&gt;    
&gt;   Theres even one directed at you evp listeners.. for those who 
can hear it. They sound alot better in wav format, mp3 is smaller in 
file size but it does lose some clarity sometimes.
&gt;    
&gt;   I had to laugh at the be silent one... I usually ask questions 
in my head but today I started a session off talking aloud. 
Something I dont usually do because it opens the door for all to 
hear and reply. Luckily I only had 2 strays pop in, but all one had 
to say was &quot;i invented the electric current&quot; and &quot;im passed away&quot; it 
was a little strange LOL and left me rackin my brain trying to 
figure out who it was because theres several scientists who I could 
fit into that category. Whether it was a partycrasher or the real 
thing...I have no clue. 
&gt;    
&gt;   There was also someone talking about &quot;im not able to do the 
accent&quot; and then the guide saying to them &quot;thats fine ok keep 
moving&quot; then he says &quot;i used to have a touch of an english accent, 
pretty good i hope&quot; 
&gt;    
&gt;   LOL
&gt;    
&gt;   I may post those later if anyone wants to hear them they are a 
little fuzzy on some words.
&gt;

Hi Misty,
I just switched my acct over to receive email from this group in my 
email inbox. Sorry for the inconvenience, but could you re-post what 
you feel is the best evp from your most recent batch for me to hear? 
By the way, this is my first post here. Joined up a couple of weeks 
ago but didn&#x27;t have the time until now to post anything here. Found 
this group after doing a search for ITC groups... thanks :)</pre>
