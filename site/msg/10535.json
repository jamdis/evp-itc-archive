Very humbling! \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  If I may be so bold as the to suggest this voice is Raudive, as \nhe \n&gt; has a very distinctive tonal quality. Secondly, there was concerns \n&gt; that little technical advice is received, just my small minded \n&gt; opinion, but we have the electronics, and the boxes in various \nforms \n&gt; work. There is little more to this type of device, except as in \nthis \n&gt; voice, some minor tweaking of components.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  &quot;A copper box&quot; go to Radio Shack, buy copper clad circuit \nboard, \n&gt; cut to desired size, solder togother with gun type soldering iron \n(I \n&gt; think it&#39;s 120 and 300 watts). Drill holes for mic and speaker. Of \n&gt; course, that&#39;s just the way I would do it. There has to be a much \n&gt; simpler, cheaper, and better way. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  Thank your for you time, sorry for the intrusion. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  Source-- Box 33, on March 23, 2008.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; In a rush?
