<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have been working on editing audio sessions from this weekend.  I 
just posted a file which reflects why I do two types of communication 
sessions.  

This file labeled Frank, is,experiements, sometimes shows just how 
communication can be missed because while we are speaking, they are 
responsing.

Frank S. doesn&#x27;t ask questions during his sessions to ensure great 
communication and that the delivery of messages are received correctly.
I do them both ways, however, this particular clip is one in which I 
personally get mad at myself given I spoke over them not getting the 
best communication.

I hate when this happens because I feel very rude to them, for I 
wouldn&#x27;t want to interupt one of my friends conversation and believe 
that these rules apply regardless of whomn I am speaking.
