<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Art and his new wife are living in Pahrump, Nevada, again. Pahrump is  
right on the California state line at the Death Valley Junction area  
of Death Valley, one of my favorite places in the world. I was there  
in late September, myself. The Bells baby, Asia, was born in May, I  
think. He is broadcastin on C2C only rarely right now because he  
wants to spend his time with the baby and his wife. He does fill in  
for George and does specials.

&gt; OHHHHHHH LOL, thanks for clearing something up in my head. I&#x27;ll try  
&gt; and vice versa that with this reply.
&gt;
&gt; I was listening to C2C not long ago and they were saying something  
&gt; about Art&#x27;s new baby&#x27;s picture being up on the webcam so I went  
&gt; there and saw little &quot;Parump&quot; and I am sitting there wondering hmmm  
&gt; wonder if thats phillipines name or is its from little drummer boy  
&gt; (parump a pum pum)
&gt;
&gt; Now I know where it came from, and you know what Art is up to.  
&gt; Still trying to part time it from overseas at his new home with his  
&gt; new wife and son, and said he was retiring but I dont think people  
&gt; will allow him to do that. So for now I think he is mostly doing  
&gt; occasional special interest shows, someone correct me if I am wrong  
&gt; I dont get a chance to tune in every show LOL
