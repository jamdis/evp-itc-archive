<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, I think you&#x27;re confusing science and scientists. Science is supposed
to be a body of knowledge that can explain all known phenomena and predict
new ones not yet observed. That&#x27;s all it is. In a few rare cases, a landmark
piece of work does just that.

One example is James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise on Electricity and
Magnetism.&quot; Not only did it explain all electromagnetic phenomena observable
(except a couple which were explained by refinements) but it predicted
things not known at the time Maxwell wrote it. Like Vivaldi antennas.

Scientists are supposed to look for holes in the existing theories and
improve on them so they can explain all phenomena. An example is the Bohr
theory of the atom. It did a great job of predicting the spectral lines of
hydrogen - the Lyman, Balmer, H series etc. But it didn&#x27;t do so well
explaining the spectral lines of things like uranium. So other theories had
to come about. And they did. They do a pretty good job of explaining
existing phenomena and predicting as yet unknown phenomena but they still
have their flaws.
However, it is true that some scientists have adopted certain arenas of
science almost as religions. But note physics deals with PHYSICAL things -
it says so right in its name. So does chemistry. It&#x27;s great if you want
better batteries, automobile engines or radios. But we&#x27;re dealing with
something here on this group that&#x27;s non-physical. To the best I can
determine, EVP and ITC are produced by spirits. These spirits transcend the
physical and only use the physical universe for their own purposes.

Evidently the one thing they love to do is comunicate, whether it be from
within a human body or outside it or from who knows where. And they are not
predictable. Science, in dealing with the physical, is not going to explain
any of this phenomena. Very little is actually known in the realm of
spirits. Mostly what I see is beliefs. Everyone seems to have their own
beliefs in this arena; some agree and some conflict. But no one seems to
have any proof of anything that would take it out of the realm of belief,
except that the phenomena do exist.

I wish I knew how the EVP voices can make words that appear at twice or half
the rate of normal speech, talk backwards, etc. I&#x27;d like to learn those
tricks! And I still don&#x27;t know what to think about shadow people. I have
seen them with my own eyes many, many times. So have others I was with. I
haven&#x27;t been successful at photographing them. For some reason the ones I&#x27;ve
experienced can be seen by human eyes but not photographed. Science lets us
down on that one. A lot of people think shadow people are evil but I have
never felt that from them. Again, that&#x27;s a belief. No one has proof of it. I
have felt &quot;evil&quot; from other things. Maybe I&#x27;ll tell you about one of these
&quot;things&quot; that was existing in someone&#x27;s attic once. Man, talk about an evil
presence! But I never got that from shadow people.

Sorry for going on so long; I just wanted to point out that science and
scientists are not the same thing and that science has indeed given us some
things (like Velcro cable ties - the greatest invention of whatever century
it was invented in).

&gt;&gt;  Wow! I am amazed.That&#x27;s pretty much what I heard! Very rare! See the
&gt;&gt; skeptics acuse people of only hearing what&#x27;s labled, and we just had another

&gt;&gt;&gt; Frank,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Very interesting. It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve listenend to your files.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The fm on this tuner sounds really active; the Others are definitely chatty
&gt;&gt;&gt; on this band.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is what I hear (in studio grade headphones):
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Your AM file @ 03 secs: &quot;Here Prin Cess&quot; (male + two escalating tones)
&gt;&gt;&gt; @ 11 secs: &quot;Be sure (static) good news&quot; (male)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Your FM file @ 01 secs: &quot;Trying to get through&quot; (in female tones)
&gt;&gt;&gt; @ 03 secs: &quot;It don&#x27;t ?boost? right&quot; (male then two tones)
&gt;&gt;&gt; @ 05 secs: &quot;Closer to cooperating?&quot; (male, first vowel sound is hard and
&gt;&gt;&gt; second vowel sound in this word is a soft &#x27;a&#x27; or &#x27;o&#x27; so it cannot be
&gt;&gt;&gt; calamity)
&gt;&gt;&gt; @ 06 secs: &quot;Till we&#x27;re done&quot; (female, fast)
&gt;&gt;&gt; @ 08 secs: &quot;Frank&quot; (male)
&gt;&gt;&gt; @ 09 secs: &quot;Hi&quot; (female singing, drawn out)
&gt;&gt;&gt; @ 11 secs: &quot;How you doing&quot; (male)
&gt;&gt;&gt; @ 14 secs: &quot;Hi&quot; (female or child)

F ank, I hink you&#x27; e con using science and scien is s. Science is supposed o be a body o knowledge ha can explain all known phenomena and p edic new ones no ye obse ed. Tha &#x27;s all i is. In a ew a e cases, a landma k piece o wo k does jus ha .

 
One example is James Cle k Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;A T ea ise on Elec ici y and Magne ism.&quot; No only did i explain all elec omagne ic phenomena obse able (excep a couple which we e explained by e inemen s) bu i p edic ed hings no known a he ime Maxwell w o e i . Like Vi aldi an ennas.

Science, in dealing wi h he physical, is no going o explain any o his phenomena. Ve y li le is ac ually known in he ealm o spi i s. Mos ly wha I see is belie s. E e yone seems o ha e hei own belie s in his a ena; some ag ee and some con lic . Bu no one seems o ha e any p oo o any hing ha would ake i ou o he ealm o belie , excep ha he phenomena do exis .

I wish I knew how he EVP oices can make wo ds ha appea a wice o hal he a e o no mal speech, alk backwa ds, e c. I&#x27;d like o lea n hose icks!
