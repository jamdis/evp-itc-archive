I live in Cary, North Carolina and rec=\r\nord when I have the time. There is no set schedule, and when I turn my radi=\r\no on and someone says hello Michael, or even shouts out &quot;Mike Edwards&quot;, or =\r\na spirit tells me I am holding a carving in my hand, who would even know I =\r\nturned the radio on? Only my wife knows I record, and we have kept this res=\r\nearch from our children as well as our neighbors. So you are suggesting tha=\r\nt Margaret, lets say who lives where I do not know, is playing a joke on me=\r\n with a high tech two way radio?\n \nitcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n\n\nHi Nathan. I always look to relevance as a key in determining whethe=\r\nr or not something is appropriate to the session. If this were a hoax, I wo=\r\nuld then have to seek an explanation for how private information is known b=\r\ny the &#39;hoax perp&#39;, particularly information that would require visual aware=\r\nness. Some of us have examples of appropriate responses being given when as=\r\nking things like, &quot;Can you name something nearby me?&quot; or &quot;Please tell me wh=\r\nat I&#39;m holding in my left hand.&quot; A sophisticated multi-transmission two way=\r\n radio would not explain answers which require &#39;visual&#39; information of some=\r\n kind (though I&#39;ll be the first to admit my understanding of electronics is=\r\n limited but I&#39;m fairly confident on this aspect.) Of course, there is alwa=\r\nys the chance that the person running the hoax is also, or in partnership w=\r\nith, an extremely talented remote viewer or psychic who is able to glean th=\r\nat visual information from the ether or the mind of the experimenter. And w=\r\nhat of those examples where people have confirmed the sound of the voice be=\r\ning &quot;just like&quot; that of their loved one in spirit? Surely the hoaxer isn&#39;t =\r\nalso able to mimic people&#39;s loved ones.If you are using EVP Maker with anyt=\r\nhing other than the allophones file, which contains no words to begin with,=\r\n you are also running the possibility of &#39;false positives&#39; albeit they woul=\r\ndn&#39;t be from a hoax. Again, I look to relevance to be key, and relevant inf=\r\no that would not come easily to a stranger is even better. For example, I t=\r\nurned on my MiniBox for the very first time and said, &quot;Hello?&quot; and immediat=\r\nely received the response, &quot;Hello Margaret.&quot; If this were a hoax, how could=\r\n that person know in less than 10 seconds, who I was by name. I had not giv=\r\nen this information out. Not to mention that you have people experimenting =\r\n24/7 and receiving similar responses. How in the world could an organizatio=\r\nn have the manpower, technology, or even the desire, to attempt such a hoax=\r\n? I mean that as a genuine inquiry, because there might be an explanation I=\r\n have not thought of. I have one example where, via radio sweep, my communi=\r\ncator was able to correctly identify the status and location of a missing p=\r\nerson (who it turns out was alive and well, so we ended up with confirmatio=\r\nn that the info given had indeed been correct - which is much less complica=\r\nted that trying to track and understand the clues when associated with the =\r\ndead, or missing but not found.) Again, if a hoax, would that have simply b=\r\neen a lucky guess on the part of the hoaxer?Bottom line for me is ... have =\r\nI wondered if it could be a hoax? Or simply a fortuitous tuning of the dial=\r\n? Yes, on both accounts. But there is enough compelling evidence to rule ou=\r\nt both of them as an explanation for the far too many relevant examples rec=\r\neived by so many of us.Good food for thought, but after digesting it, I&#39;d h=\r\nave to say, &quot;No, a sophisticated hoax does not sufficiently explain the phe=\r\nnomena on a large scale.&quot;Margaret--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Nathan Sha=\r\nrman &lt;v1230mail@...&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Has it ever occurred to you, that some one or=\r\n&gt; organisation, could be using a radio to say the things&gt; you heard?&gt; &gt; Thi=\r\ns whole radio and spirit voices, could be a MASSIVE&gt; HOAX, perpetuated by s=\r\nome one with a sophisticated&gt; multi-transmission two way radio.&gt; &gt; Think ab=\r\nout it.&gt; &gt; THAT IS WHY I USE EVPmaker only to commuincate with&gt; the other d=\r\nimension.&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________&gt; Do You Yah=\r\noo!?&gt; Tired of spam?
