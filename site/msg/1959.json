It&#39;s wierd how when a box is not working right, I actually get more. \nI disabled the audio AGC, which helps not amplify the noise as much (with it \ndisconnected).\n\n\nFrank\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;joseph a. cioppi, sr.&quot; &lt;joecioppi@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] A thought pick up?\n&gt;Date: Sun, 26 Aug 2007 23:15:35 -0400\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank,\n&gt;\n&gt;This was a fast rate but it seemed very clear to me.
