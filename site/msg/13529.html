I do not have an ovilus or a puck - I was going to get one, but I particip=
ated in many sessions alternating puck, ovilus, and radio devices.

 

Alth=
ough at times we would get relevant responses on the puck and ovilus, more =
often than not it would be confusing, irrelevant, and disjointed.


We woul=
d invariably return to the the radios and have much better results, so at t=
his time I have decided to concentrate my efforts on radios and a couple of=
 other methods and areas I am still researching.

 

I always encourage peo=
ple to do their own research, though. If you want to, go for it!

Just let =
us know what happens.
The results I talked about were not meant to discoura=
ge you, just to tell you what we experienced. Maybe some people do better w=
ith the puck and ovilus. Not everyone is meant to do everything.

I personally have not used this device, but =
a close friend and fellow investigator just purchased one. She has used it =
only a few times but the results were encourageing. On her first recorded s=
ession, when asking "why are you here", the reply that she recieved certain=
ly seemed relevant. The Ovilus stated " fell running down stairs, broken ne=
ck". Another interesting response from the recording was in reply to the qu=
estion "who are you?" The response from the Ovilus was "ghost". However, sh=
e also recieved responses that did not seem relevant to the questions she w=
as asking at the time. She sends me all of her recordings for review so I w=
ill keep you posted on the results. Personally, I can't wait to get my hand=
s on one to try it out for myself.
