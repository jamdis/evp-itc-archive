Maybe you could back track some of the recent messages recieved and see if there is a pattern or rhymn or reason.  \n   \n   \n  Tesla had a dream of providing free energy to the world. In 1900, backed by $150,000 from financier J.P. Morgan, Tesla began construction of his so called &quot;Wireless Broadcasting System&quot; tower on Long Island, New York. This broadcasting tower was intended to link the world&#39;s telephone and telegraph services, as well as transmit pictures, stock reports, and weather information worldwide. Unfortunately, Morgan cut funding when he realized that aims.      Tesla reported that he had received radio signals from Mars and Venus. Today we know that he was actually receiving the signals from distant stars, but too little was known anout the universe at that time. Instead, the press had a field day with his &quot;outrageous&quot; claims.   In his Manhattan lab, Tesla made the earth into an electric tuning fork. He managed to get a steam-driven oscillator to vibrate at the same frequency as the ground beneath him (like Ella Fitgerald breaking the glass with her voice in those old Memorex\n commercials).   The result? An earthquake on all the surrounding city blocks. The buildings trembled, the windows broke, and the plaster fell off the walls.   Tesla contended that, in theory, the same principle could be used to destroy the Empire State Building or even possibly split the Earth in two. Tesla had accurately determined the resonant frequencies of the Earth almost 60 years before science could confirm his results.   In his Colorado Springs lab in 1899, he sent waves of energy all the way through the Earth, causing them to bounce back to the source (providing the theory for today&#39;s accurate earthquake seismic stations). When the waves came back, he added more electricity to it.\n   \n   \n  \n\njuli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; wrote:\n            If I could add my 2 cents.
