Copper is next best at 59.6 E06 S/m. Gold is not the\n&gt; best, at 45.2 E06 S/m. Aluminum is much farther down, at 37.8 E06 S/m.\n&gt;\n&gt; Silver and gold are expensive. They are usually used to plate RF assemblies\n&gt; where the skin effect takes place (current doesn&#39;t flow uniformly through a\n&gt; conductor at RF frequencies but mainly travels at the surface of the\n&gt; conductor). Gold has the advantage that it never tarnishes or corrodes with\n&gt; most things it is exposed to. It&#39;s used a lot in contacts for rotary\n&gt; switches and relays.\n&gt;\n&gt; Zack\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, May 27, 2009 at 9:38 AM, Golden Phoenix &lt;golden_phoenix42@\n&gt; yahoo.com&lt;http://us.mc01g.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=golden_phoenix42@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    Firrst Electrical job I was on as a helper in 1976 was to pick up a\n&gt;&gt; pole that was to feeding a house someone had wired in aluminum that had\n&gt;&gt; burned to the ground due to a bad connection it had just been built.

The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livingroom\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; downstairs.
