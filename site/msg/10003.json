If you want to be \ntaken serious in this field and not under a microscope with the \nquestion of whether or not you in fact did actually get a voice \nand/or response and that clip is edited, don&#39;t bother putting it up \nfor public display.  You can amplify it, take out the hiss, but you \nbetter not splice it in any way, cause your just asking for trouble.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; I had this very debate with Bruce long ago.  I know first hand that \nif in fact its edited many question your motives behind why you in \nfact would bother removing the dead airtime between.  The very first \nthing that came into question when editing EVP from Frank&#39;s Box many \nmoons ago (pun intended) that a certain person was in fact splicing \nhis audio by putting the questions and response right after.  Many \nnow consider him to be a fraud and this was just one of the reason \nbuilt upon others as a direct result.  You are altering the clip, no \nifs and or butts about.  It can therefore hurt your creditability as \na researcher in the paranormal field.  Regardless with you save your \noriginal clips.  Everything you do comes into question.  You can \nclearly tell by the skip in rhythm as you play the audio vs the free \nflowing of the dial when it has been altered.  Real Time is real time \npeople, not 15 seconds after the fact.  If you have to questions what \nyou\n&gt;  got....&quot;If in Doubt, throw It Out&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; People, there is one thing that you have to remember.  The word of \nbox research is spreading, and there are those who are implementing \nit as an additional tool on investigations.  This is not just some \nwho are going to give up their current status as a ghost hunter to \nnow slowly be a box researcher ( for that was never a thought for \nme).  I was hoping that through my research I could in fact \nincorporate it on my investigations.  Because of the radio fragments \nitself, there are many that do not support this research and believe \nwe are reaching and grasping at nothing, and literally laugh when the \nsubject of box research comes up.  Do you really want to give them an \nextra ammunition as splicing your clips?  I know myself that there is \nmore that meets the eye in this line for communication, and I do \nstand proud and true of pursuing real time communication, myself, but \ncutting out the dead air is not just because you don&#39;t want to listen \nto it, or you can&#39;t\n&gt;  fit it all is a lame excuse.  Use a different program!\n&gt;  \n&gt; I personally have questioned many on their clips and have to tell \nyou that if you truly want to be considered as a professional \nparanormal investigator/ researcher that if you intend to use this \nprotocol for you evp/box research clips, you stand to loose your \ncreditability and the word fraud may just come into question.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, if you have nothing to loose as far as your reputation and \nor not in it to prove anything to anyone, be my guest.  There are \nmany here that are not involved in the paranormal field and a prefer \nevp-itc researcher vs. other areas of the super natural.  If they are \nnot putting themselves out there for God and Country to see, and are \nonly doing it for your personal results and curiosity, and can could \ncareless with others thing, then clip away to your hearts content!  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Just remember, if someone who is currently studying evp and not box \nresearch sees and hears your clips, don&#39;t be surprised, if they start \nquestioning your motives and box research all together!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just adding my 2 cents!\n&gt; Juli\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; psfponies &lt;psfponies@yahoo. com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Yes I get your point Rees.

Anyone that \n&gt; cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the file\n&gt; &gt; that has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously \n&gt; garbage like the &quot;EH O EH AH O EH UR&quot; in between words.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For example &quot;Is there anyone here that wishes to \n&gt; communicate_ YES_AH ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE&quot;\n&gt; &gt; It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return to \na \n&gt; file that I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold some\n&gt; &gt; relivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly \n&gt; listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At this stage in real time communication the messages are the top \n&gt; priority.\n&gt; &gt; I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained \n&gt; and made available to individuals that make a request \n&gt; &gt; for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may \n&gt; be made, and god knows there are always fanatical \n&gt; &gt; sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to attack \n&gt; an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that \n&gt; &gt; our research files should be made available on request by every \n&gt; tom dick and harry that is unknown to us and may potentially\n&gt; &gt; doctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the \n&gt; researcher that receives the request for raw research data should \n&gt; &gt; scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment \n&gt; before handing out any research data.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; &gt; From: yahoogroups@ ...\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2008 09:55:42 +0200\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I \n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a \nwhole, \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can \n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip \n&gt; (including\n&gt; &gt; the experimenter&#39; s voice), filter or denoise it to make it \n&gt; clearer, but\n&gt; &gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP \n&gt; match\n&gt; &gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should \n&gt; always\n&gt; &gt; be provided along with the edited version.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But that&#39;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to \n&gt; express, as\n&gt; &gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical \n&gt; public.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Stefan\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these \n&gt; files.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the \n&gt; message \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can&#39;t piece \n&gt; these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; files together to make something it&#39;s not, so i keep them in \n&gt; true \n&gt; &gt; &gt; form pretty much to the original.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Steve\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hey Steve Forgot to ask...how much editing was needed to get \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; file?
