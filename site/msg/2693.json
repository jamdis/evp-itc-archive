I \ncan talk into it and some of my EVP contacts answer back right away. \nBut because I am not knowledgeable about sound recorders except for \nthe basics when it comes to editing my EVP, I would like to know if \nsomeone here could download the 10 day trial version of DC Seven and \nlet me know what you think about it. I&#39;m having a few problems with \ngetting it to work as it&#39;s probably supposed to work... mainly having \na problem with feedback and so on.. \nHere&#39;s the link to DC Seven&#39;s 10 trial demo:\nhttp://www.enhancedaudio.com/dc_seven.htm\nHope someone here will try it out because I would love to know if it \nworks for you! \n\nwingd\n\n\n\n                         \n\n __________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
