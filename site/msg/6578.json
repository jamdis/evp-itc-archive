Just a single post stating that I had \nposted the files and where they could be found.\n\nNow this is the dilemma, If you do not post an announcement for each \nfile and you trust that the single post announcing all the files that \nhave been posted will suffice, well I don&#39;t think so!\n\nI know that most individuals here do not listen to or reply to every \nsingle file posted but I will usually get some comments on the better \nor more interesting ones. So far from the posting yesterday &quot;NADA&quot;\n\nIf anyone saw the post I wrote announcing the files I posted to the \nfiles section, please for my own satisfaction let me know.\n\nOtherwise I don&#39;t think the one post notice thing is gonna cut it!\n\nBruce"}
