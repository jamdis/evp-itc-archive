It is the only clickable thing--I can&#39;t  \nclick the title of the clip, for example. When I click it, nothing  \never happens. I looks like it is loading but nothing comes of it.\n\nI&#39;ve had this problem with esnips since it first started up. I have  \nnever yet been able to get any clip of any length by anyone to ever  \nload.\n\nAnn\n\nOn Feb 1, 2008, at 2:33 PM, bruce halliday wrote:\n\n&gt; Ann,\n&gt;\n&gt; Which icon are you talking about?\n&gt;\n&gt; bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; From: lisby@...\n&gt; Date: Fri, 1 Feb 2008 13:07:46 -0500\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] ok here we are I posted a bunch of new RS470  \n&gt; files to esnips\n&gt;\n&gt; Okay, Bruce, the job of the day is figure out why I get nothing  \n&gt; when I click on the icon.
