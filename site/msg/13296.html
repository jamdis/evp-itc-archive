It's too bad you didn't get more participation.=A0 I'd be happy to be part=
 of the second test too.

One thing I'd suggest: remove any question(s) tha=
t you are asking, from the audio file.=A0 Since you're trying to study how =
different people will interpret the same file, and are trying not to give a=
ny hints as to what other people hear in the file, leaving the question in =
could be a factor there.=A0 For example, if you are asking a yes/no questio=
n in the audio, then the people listening might be inclined to restrict the=
ir answers to having heard a "yes" or a "no" (because the question implies =
that is what may follow).=A0 But by leaving the question out, you remove an=
y hints as to what they should expect.
