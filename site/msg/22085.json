Did you know that radio sweep is nothing new?  Many researchers have been using it for years.  Franz Seidel used it in the 1950&#39;s.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I guess that&#39;s where frank got the idea, just duplicate what has worked since the 50&#39;s.  I thought frank came up with the idea of radio sweep, this book is full of stuff i never knew.  People should pick it up and read it, i got through 165 pages in just a few days.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
