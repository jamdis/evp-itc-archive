<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>These are probably more unidirectional, being the little electret mic
elements. I use them cuz there are cheap, and small.

&gt; Do you find better results with a uni or omni directional mic?

&gt;  The speaker in on one &quot;end&quot; of the echo chamber tube, and the mic is one
&gt; the other, In this case I glued thin plastic sheet from something I bought
&gt; in a blister pack over the ends of the tubes, then cut a hole the diameter
&gt; of the tube for the speaker, and for the mic I melted a hole with a
&gt; soldering iron, then glued mic and speaker in place.. I have used all
&gt; kinds of stuff for the chamber, 12 inch X 4 foot long MDF board chamber,
&gt; aluminum foil in a 1/4 inch wood frame, metal channels formed by gluing in
&gt; metal strips. In box #1, I used a triangle shaped cany tin, and hte main
&gt; board for the box was mounted on top.
&gt;
&gt;  The mic feed the fourth op amp channel of the sweep generator, where it&#x27;s
&gt; amplified and forms the line out signal, and then drives the monitor/panel
&gt; speaker. The electret mic has to be biased to work, if you buy one at RS I
&gt; think the paskage shows the details. it gets a little complicated.

&gt;&gt; So how is the mic positioned? Is it on the other end then? The mic then
&gt;&gt; feeds into what?

&gt;&gt;   The speaker is from a dead mini tape deck, the chamber is 3 inch
&gt;&gt; lengths of 3/4 inch PVC conduit, flattened on a band saw--very carefully. I
&gt;&gt; try to enclose it to minimize feedback, but that&#x27;s only partially
&gt;&gt; successful. And this is how it sounds, at 3 seconds &quot;Purple Princess Ghost
&gt;&gt; Box&quot;.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  The first speaker I had glued in the lid was bad, so had to replace it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Depends on what I have room for. The mic is the standard 3/8 inch
&gt;&gt;&gt; diameter electret mic, and the speaker I try to find the smallest possible 8
&gt;&gt;&gt; ohm, with decent sound.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Frank,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Couple questions on your echo chamber. How big are the speaker and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; microphone on each side? Are they enclosed in a box with the tubes with one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on each end and how are they positioned? Just trying to piece things
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; together. :)
