<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, familiar with the concept, but not the religious aspect. It&#x27;s basically the same as what they tell me, but they make no bones about it being 2012. &quot;They&quot; don&#x27;t go into anything religous, nothing about only true believers being saved. Sometimes, but very rarely, I get that stuff like Astar command (channeled crap) how the ships will come and save everyone. I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath waiting! Same with the Jesus stuff. Change the names, but it&#x27;s same story. I recommend everyone read the book &quot;Messagers of Deception&quot;, before believeing you&#x27;re getting the absolute gospel truth. 

 Yeah, some imply &quot;right now&quot;, other say 2012, other say like someday. 

 If it&#x27;s only for the righteous, ya won&#x27;t see me in that number. I won&#x27;t sell, or give my soul to anything, I don&#x27;t care what they claim it is. 

 Resurrection is just more of that ancient 5000 years plus old fear based guessing what some deity wants religion and people&#x27;s fear of death. It&#x27;s Zoroasterism, the roots of the bible go back that far, they even had the virgin birth, eons before Jesus. I think with EVP/paranormal we can see there is no death, so the resurrection thing, non-sensical. When there is 600 plus commandments, you can be sure it&#x27;s a guessing game about what some deity wants. You can&#x27;t think, you can&#x27;t question, you have to fear wearing the wrong clothes--it stupid! 

 &quot;they&quot; tell me that crap too about how I&#x27;ll be transformed into  this woman they talk about--right!  Not holding my breath or selling my soul to be that. Wanting to be one gender or another is illogical, gender is for breeding, it has no other purpose. I won&#x27;t play the ego game, and I&#x27;ll do the void before I become an instrument of evil. I do not have to exist!
