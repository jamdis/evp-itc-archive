<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I too would like to hear some audio files from other boxes.  I&#x27;m 
currently without a box for the time being.  The antenna broke off 
the board and i wasn&#x27;t paying attention where it came off.  Just 
needs some soldering i&#x27;m sure, i just have to figure out where the 
wire goes on the board.  Hey wish me luck and hopefully i&#x27;ll be up 
again soon with some new clips.  The box does call me Steve as soon 
as i turn it on, but they have also asked for frank or &quot;purple&quot;.  
What a weird road we are traveling down.  My mom was using the box 
one day and stated her name, but my feeling is that they already 
know who is using the box and you don&#x27;t need to clarify who you 
are.  It basically works off of energy and besides, the spirit realm 
is all around us and can see what we are doing.  We just can&#x27;t see 
them.  Well wish me luck, i&#x27;m going to try and work on the box.

&gt; Yeah Steve has gotten some good results. I would like to hear some 
of yours and Rosemary&#x27;s as well as the others. I think that the more 
people share the more others can learn and try things out for 
themselves. 
&gt;    
&gt;   They have always called me by my complete name no matter what 
method I use. Music, Sweep Tuning, Water, Evpmaker, Radio, 
etcetera... there are some voices which remain consistent enough to 
modulate any source.

&gt;           Hi Misty, thank you for your post. I will upload some 
files. There 
&gt; have been interesting sessions with how the Boxes address people 
by 
&gt; name. And now that it&#x27;s happening to Steve it seems like this is 
part 
&gt; of the phenomena of the Box that is repeatable and observed by 
&gt; others. -Bill

&gt; &gt; Bill said something that had me thinking. He mentioned that when 
he 
&gt; first got his box it called Franks name repeatedly. That isnt the 
&gt; first time I saw someone say that. I know quite a few of you now 
have 
&gt; been given a box or even constructed your own versions like Steve 
&gt; based on the work Frank did. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have heard a couple of peoples results here but I would like 
to 
&gt; hear more so I am going to ask if you have one you comment on your 
&gt; use of it and how you think the results went as well as maybe post 
a 
&gt; few sound files that I can hear. I have spent years listening to 
the 
&gt; box voices but its refreshing to hear others results and see the 
&gt; variations as with any other evp method, it differs by 
user/location. 
&gt; LOL you know who you are and I wont name you all but I do hope you 
&gt; will share with us.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
&gt; &gt; Misty
