Thanks Tom for your comments.=C2=A0 You say that different people listening=
 to the recordings often here the same thing.=C2=A0 But Frank says that is =
rarely the case.=C2=A0 Wouldn't Frank be more of the expert here?

The fact that the operator CAN and DOES make recordings=
 and files of understandable words and phrases shows that we are dealing wi=
th an OBJECTIVE rather than a subjective phenomenon here.  Two things appea=
r to be going on though.  

  First there is an actual voice modulated sign=
al. Different people who listen to it often hear the same thing.  The sound=
 is not perfect and is very noisy, so that would explain others who cannot =
hear the message.

     The second thing is that some people can listen to =
the noise as a "random field", and with a slightly altered state of mind, t=
his field will induce latent "mediumship" ability in the operator and he or=
 she will get a lot more information and voice material than another listen=
er.



Note that the content random fields have little or nothing in common=
 with whatever imagery or sounds may be percieved from them.  They simply e=
nhance the user to access psychic information that, while even not being a =
"psychic" allows him to get info normally innaccessable to him/her.

If the=
re is any objective percieved sound similar to what is heard by others impr=
essed upon the background noise, it might be due to the spirit who is speak=
ing being PRESENT.  That entity would then be able to get the message throu=
gh to the operator Psychicly on another level.  that the words are also in =
the noise would be a co-incidence.



I work with VISUAL random fields---Th=
e imagery, while clear, is formed in my mind/eye system , so I cannot photo=
graph it.  Some of this EVP background noise may be working the same way to=
o---formed in the Mind/EAR system.  This is only heard by the primary opera=
tor and likely cannot be recorded to a file.  

  But some random field stu=
ff IS objective--for example, using a random backdrop for ghost photos make=
s the ghosts easier to, and more often appear in a photo.  This is equavale=
nt to the EVP that people can hear on the recorded file.



I will discuss =
and explain random field theory itself, later, in its own posting.
