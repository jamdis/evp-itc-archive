I am impressed! What a trooper you are, and that you are in a way assisting to get closure! I was thinking last night about this coed at Chapel Hil here in my state of NC, as he was shot in the head in a street , and they have no witnesses.  Her name is Eve Carlson.  If we can perfect this tool, and as you said have the documents to back up what messages you get, think of how many people can be helped.  So I assume the police you work with have not pushed you away as a nut job, and are quite happy to receive what you have to help them.  That is great.  
   
  In helping children that may still be alive, there has to be spirits out there that know they are alive and where they are.  I wonder if on the other side there is a command center or group just like this group, working to set up a working link where they can assist. Heck, if I was dead, Id join that group and link up with folks like you.  
   
  You are a wonderful person and thanks for sharing..
   
  If I get anything related to a case, I will send it to you.

It's very little but, but has provided additional lines of questioning for authorities to pursue.

      Wow, Juli! I never thought of boxes being used this way, especially 
to try and find missing and abducted children/people, etc, BEFORE 
they are harmed. What a great idea to discreetly work with law 
enforcement behind the scenes to see if it is viable. ;)
