I don&#39;t believe he owns a box, or else he would post the video, but maybe now he will get one. He should take the video down being that he is using Franks picture without permission, but obviously he likes the attention from it. So if I were Frank I would contact YouTube and ask to have it removed for that reason. Secondly, even though those of us from the GB community first thoughts is to defend the work, he is loving the attention from it. So I suggest watch the video, vote it down if you do not agree with it, but I wouldn&#39;t leave him anymore comments because he appears to be enjoying them, unless you just cannot help yourself and feel you have to say something. As his replies back and forth show he is enjoying it.\n\nGabreael"}
