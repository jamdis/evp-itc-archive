Got one evp...man said &quot;were dead&quot;, I also went over to the Jewish Burial Site. I asked to have an Elder or someone with an accent to speak so I could have some proof. I get this EVP. It says &quot;Jim &gt;Salonika &lt; Hanukka&quot; Now I&#39;m NOT positive it says &quot;Solonika&quot; but I tried to use &quot;savonika&quot; (spelled it something like that) and Google gave the Salonika suggestion.
