I remember a couple of years ago, on another \n&gt; board, Frank used to get references to pizza a lot.

That&#39;s funny because i was \n&gt; doing a \n&gt; &gt;   session over Skype with my sister and i told my sister i had to \n&gt; go and \n&gt; &gt;   eat and the box said &quot;Yeah Pizza&quot;. They were close, i was \nhaving \n&gt; food \n&gt; &gt;   delivered from a pizza place but i was having lasagna. Either \nway \n&gt; i \n&gt; &gt;   think they like pizza. Maybe it&#39;s all they serve over there???\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%\n40yahoogroups.com&gt;, \n&gt; Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   wrote:\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &gt; This is the &quot;Ghostman&quot; an old digital Walkman, with a sweep \n&gt; &gt;   generator, amplifiers to drive stereo speakers, and line output \n&gt; for a \n&gt; &gt;   recorder.
