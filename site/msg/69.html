Amy,
If you don't have any raw audio that german broadcast wav I sent last =
night should work for you. :)

   First you have to hit the =
folder icon to open, and load a wav file for the raw audio. I usually use h=
uman speech as the raw audio, but music will work too, it has to be in .wav=
 format. Then you hit the record button at the bottom of the window, then t=
he yellow arrow at the top, and a box should open where you can type in a q=
uestion. When you click ok in the question box, then EVPmaker should run. Y=
ou'll have to play with the "overlap" "z-cross" and "segments" ms setting t=
o find what works best, and produces the easiest to hear voices. The voices=
 come out distorted, and might take some practice to hear.
