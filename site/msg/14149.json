Its part  of why \nI prefer to use water method for my recordings, then there is no  deciding \nwhat is what. I suggest you start out recording short sessions.  I usually \nrecord sweep for about 3 minutes at most. With water its  always about 30 \nseconds of recording time and that recording can contain  1-30 messages on -74 \nspeed. The speech is usually very very fast,  different vibration than we \nhave and with water the speech is way  outside normal human speech rates.\n \nAttaching a recent h2o clip it should come as attachment to those  getting \nindividual emails. I dunno if you will hear this so I chose a  short one of \nsomeone saying &quot;I spoke&quot; to give you some idea of what I  mean. This is in \nthe -74 speed range (slowed in audacity).
