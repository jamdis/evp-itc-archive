I&#39;ve been trying to contact \nmy ex-girlfriend that passed last year at 29.  That does sound like \nher voice, she has been coming through since Sunday night and i \nactually heard them through the radio telling her to talk and she \nsaid &quot;Hi Steve&quot;.  They were like training her to use the radio, \npretty weird stuff but it was good to hear from her in her own \nvoice.  The response time is remarkable with these radios, they seem \nto answer right away very &quot;frank&#39;s box&quot;-like.  These will keep me \noccupied while i wait for #27---the #13 replacement.  I&#39;m really \nexcited about that one, it may be the one to live up to for all \nfuture boxes.  I&#39;m sure Frank could buy a radio shack box and add a \nsound chamber, that would probably really enhance the voices.  These \nother boxes and radios are great, but there&#39;s only one Frank&#39;s Box \nfor all others to try to live up to.  I don&#39;t think a 10 Minute mod \non a $25 dollar radio will ever replace the time and effort frank \nputs into his boxes.  But anybody can try these radios and that&#39;s \nwhat is important, but without Frank there would have been no \nadvancement in ITC.  Someone had to break the ground work.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Steve this one is shockingly responsive.
