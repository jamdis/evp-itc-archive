Unfortunatley you\nwill hear her say what she thinks she hears in the files. Please try not to\nbe influenced by her. I will admit though that she seems to hear these\nthings much better then I can.\n\nThough I am still not convinced, some of these are uncanny, and I was\nsurprised. I will be conducting ongoing, regular experiments with this.\n\nOpinions are welcome.\n\nThanks!\nApril\n\nHi All,These a e om my i s session wi h my new P SB-7.I conduc ed his expe imen wi h my 6 yea old daugh e .
