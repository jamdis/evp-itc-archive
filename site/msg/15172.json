Was about 3 miles out-have recorded =\r\nhere before (Vandelia). This time my recorder was acting up (DR60). The REC=\r\n led indicator would flash sometimes (supposed to remain steady) and I woul=\r\nd notice that the timer would stay in place for sometimes 5 seconds before =\r\nit would change up one number....I though I had broken it somehow. I did he=\r\nar lots of LOUD splatter noises on playback while in the field. My battery =\r\nindicator showed 2 of 3 bars, but I went in to town and got fresh AAA&#39;s any=\r\nway. I then went to water trough and the flashing still happened for 2 reco=\r\nrdings here. I then said for the &quot;bad guy&quot; to leave and stop messing with m=\r\ny recorder. Well then on my 3rd attempt....recorder started working fine. A=\r\nfter I finished the 3rd recording I packed up and went to the fairgrounds (=\r\njust a spur of the moment) *I thought.....so at fairgrounds I recorded for =\r\na little over 10 minutes (I stopped at an old -church/school/courthouse- (s=\r\ningle room log cabin-multiple uses back then) that was used in Debuke Iowa =\r\nduring 1823 (think was date). And I also asked questions around 2 other rec=\r\nonstructed buildings from long ago. Well I got home....when my recorder was=\r\n acting up in country I find a Male evp say &quot;Get Out Of My Face&quot;. I think h=\r\ne was guy messing with my recorder........Then while at the water trough (r=\r\necorder still acting up even with 2 new batteries) I finally get it to work=\r\n (after telling what I think followed me &quot;to leave&quot;). At the end of my last=\r\n recording (the good one) from this water trough, I hear a little girl say =\r\n&quot;come to the fair....someone said&quot; ***So I didn&#39;t go to the fairgrounds uni=\r\nnvited*** I just decided to go for know reason I had guessed. Well what I a=\r\nm so &quot;disturbed&quot; about now.........is that while I was playing these other =\r\nrecordings I ACCIDENTALLY-ERASED my 10 plus minutes of recording from fairg=\r\nrounds BEFORE I even got a chance to listen or download it. OOOoooowwww!!! =\r\n:) Makes me mad. No telling what could have been on there. I was INVITED&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;shucks!! I will upload the &quot;get out of my face&quot; as the little girl is way =\r\nto quite to hear. The guy is not so quite-but is still LOW audio. I don&#39;t w=\r\nant him playing with my recorder anymore :/\n\n\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_0008_01C9F567.37D74060\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18783&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;Bummer!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nsty=\r\nle=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px=\r\n; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; \ndir=3Dltr&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10=\r\npt arial&quot;&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV \n  style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt=\r\n arial; BACKGROUND: #e4e4e4; font-color: black&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; \n  &lt;A title=3D=\r\nclockdryve@... href=3D&quot;mailto:clockdryve@...&quot;&gt;James W. \n  Hyslo=\r\npe&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A title=3DEVP-I=\r\nTC@yahoogroups.com \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Wednes=\r\nday, June 24, 2009 8:46 \n  PM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Su=\r\nbject:&lt;/B&gt; [EVP-ITC] sometimes they get you \n  while your coming AND going =\r\n:)&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;I went out to record=\r\n today out in country.
