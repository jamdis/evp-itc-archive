So when the radio is doing the sweep, is it important to have a random  
sw=
eep or a linear? Does one work better than the other? Also is it important =
to 
 be able to very the speed of the sweep?

They do hear, but as far I know, not through the  bo=
x---but--they do seem 
to indicate the box transmits something, maybe a  qu=

that is. You don't even have to have to sound comin=

recordings, like connecting the recorder via the headph=
