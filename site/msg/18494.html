<div> Same old th=
ing, heard them talking about "it hits the earth" again last night while te=
sting one of those single supply dual sweep boxes, so set up a hack radio I=
 had handy. "--BehindTheSun--ComesFarFromEarth--(jack-frag)IsComin'--Sessio=
n-EarthWillThenCollide-ItEnds--Comet-Good(?)". The jack thing is Jack FM, 1=
05.5 FM a rock station. Presumable 2012. The December 21st date from the Ma=
yans seems to be a middle number, there's like a window right around C=
hristmas, as they seem to mention the 17th along with this stuff. Who knows=
 if it means anything, but what I don't like are those that profess to "kno=
w better". </div>

a littel better, but it's over 3mb.</div>
