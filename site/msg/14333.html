<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am having excellent results with my &quot;cheap&quot; NUMARK HF 125 headphones. I got them for $30 New in package from local pawn shop (I just got another pair yesterday). They are very comfortable...have over the ear soft leatherette cups (smaller over ear-rests on outer parts of ear) has leatherette foam band on top of head also. Nice adjustable fit too. These outperform my new AKG MkII K240&#x27;s that I Just got in the mail 2 days ago. So price means nothing hear. I paid $135 shipped from eBay for the K240&#x27;s. Others are selling them  for near $200. I did a web search....these Numark HF 125&#x27;s are selling for under $20 at many places. They are advertised as mini DJ headphones. Here are the SPECS: 1/4&quot; stereo plug (needs 1/8&quot; adapter for pc), Large 40mm Mylar speaker drivers (english conversion 1.2 inches) 20 - 20,000 HZ Frequency response, 32 ohm impedance. Believe it or not.....these are SUPER headphones :) I assure you, they will detect the EVP&#x27;s that others miss. I have nothing to do with the numark company....I know what works though.
