<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ann, 

I think it is safe to say that everyone has their own methodology of 
recording and how they handle the captured audio files.  Nothing 
wrong with that, as being allowed to experiment, be creative, and 
think out of the &quot;box&quot; is of great value, IMHO.

The issues with any of this is that again, people will demand to have 
their own paranormal/spiritual experiences as &quot;proof.&quot;  Yet, we 
cannot prove it to anyone, as the &quot;evidence&quot; will never be good 
enough.  I would rather focus (as I am lead to work with said 
devices) on how I believe it is to be used by me.  Therefore I allow 
everyone else the grace to work with these however they deem.  

I think there is value in being able to share our ideas, triumphs, 
failures, etc.  That is how results will improve, by bouncing ideas, 
trying new things and working together.  If rule and law are put in 
place for everyone, then we limit creativity which is needed to 
overcome obstacles through invention.  

There will always be skeptics and critics, but one thing seems 
certain: everyone has their own time when they become open to the 
possibility of the paranormal/spiritual existing.  I just choose to 
share with those whose time has come.  :)

&gt; I have gotten some very long sequences and have posted them, as 
they  
&gt; were given to me. I do not clip anything out. My messages come  
&gt; through very, very quickly, so I do slow them and often amplify 
the  
&gt; sequence. So, long sequences are indeed possible and do happen. I  
&gt; just want you to know that is the case.

&gt; &gt; Bruce,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My only problem with this is when I did started Box research 2 
1/2  
&gt; &gt; - 3 Months ago.  From ghost box research (not sound soap, or  
&gt; &gt; EVPmaker) I saw alot of messages/files posted  that were 4-10 
words  
&gt; &gt; long, and you and others were bragging on how long of a message  
&gt; &gt; y&#x27;all had, and that nobody else could get messages that long.  
That  
&gt; &gt; is were I feel that I have been mislead.  I didn&#x27;t know that 
those  
&gt; &gt; files/messages had the garbage cut out of it.  I actually 
thought  
&gt; &gt; y&#x27;all got messages that long from the radio/Franks Box.  I was  
&gt; &gt; trying to get communication like that,  and wondered why I  
&gt; &gt; couldn&#x27;t.  I do know now that it is physically possible to get 
that  
&gt; &gt; type of communication after I lost my session 22, but it doesn&#x27;t  
&gt; &gt; happen like that every time.  I mean no disrespect about this  
&gt; &gt; situation.  Also I don&#x27;t see myself as a &quot;Newbie&quot; anymore.  If 
you  
&gt; &gt; want to go by ranks, I would like to be refer ed as a &quot;amateur 
box  
&gt; &gt; researcher&quot;.  If you have anything else to say, I think it needs 
to  
&gt; &gt; be taken care of in private emails.  You should have my work and  
&gt; &gt; personal email addresses.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks

&gt; &gt; With all do respect and I do mean that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You are a newbie and you just started box research.
&gt; &gt; You are pursuing this subject quite passionately.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you feel that you have been misled in any advice or  
&gt; &gt; representation here.
&gt; &gt; Go back and look at the posts from when you first started asking  
&gt; &gt; questions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; you will note that I have always said that the &quot;CRAP&quot; was cut 
from  
&gt; &gt; my files
&gt; &gt; and even have recommended audio programs to new researchers for  
&gt; &gt; that specific purpouse.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And you seem to be under the misconception that because you take  
&gt; &gt; out the blips and blurbs
&gt; &gt; that the message or answer somehow changes, no it does not!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; the message is the same only the bits of noise crap are gone.
&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s like you speaking a sentence once and coughing in the 
middle,  
&gt; &gt; and then repeating the sentence without coughing.
&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s the same sentence with the same meaning, minus the cough.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; William, I like you and your dedication to learning this 
research,  
&gt; &gt; but you are still learning and should take in subjects like this  
&gt; &gt; and digest them
&gt; &gt; before arguing the point with much more experienced researchers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Again no disrespect meant, just some advice from a friend.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My point is let everybody know that the clip is cut, because it  
&gt; &gt; just might mislead people (Newbies) in thinking that you get  
&gt; &gt; messages that long without all the bullshit.  They might wander 
why  
&gt; &gt; they can&#x27;t get a messages like that.  I think I been somewhat 
mis  
&gt; &gt; lead myself on this subject when I first started box research.

&gt; &gt; My thoughts on cut out the garbage leads people to believe that

&gt; &gt; Stefan,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I do remove the &quot;garbage&quot; from my files.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At this point in my research, the message is more important to 
me  
&gt; &gt; than the proof of it.
&gt; &gt; I think most of us here will agree that we are receiving some 
sort  
&gt; &gt; of paranormal communication.
&gt; &gt; but it definitely exists. now we need to concentrate on the  
&gt; &gt; messages they need us to hear and the answers to the questions
&gt; &gt; we ask and in turn our answers to their questions. Anyone that  
&gt; &gt; cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the 
file
&gt; &gt; that has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously  
&gt; &gt; garbage like the &quot;EH O EH AH O EH UR&quot; in between words.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For example &quot;Is there anyone here that wishes to 
communicate_YES_AH  
&gt; &gt; ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE&quot;
&gt; &gt; It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return to 
a  
&gt; &gt; file that I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold 
some
&gt; &gt; relivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly  
&gt; &gt; listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At this stage in real time communication the messages are the 
top  
&gt; &gt; priority.
&gt; &gt; I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained  
&gt; &gt; and made available to individuals that make a request
&gt; &gt; for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may 
be  
&gt; &gt; made, and god knows there are always fanatical
&gt; &gt; sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to 
attack  
&gt; &gt; an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that
&gt; &gt; our research files should be made available on request by every 
tom  
&gt; &gt; dick and harry that is unknown to us and may potentially
&gt; &gt; doctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the  
&gt; &gt; researcher that receives the request for raw research data should
&gt; &gt; scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment 
before  
&gt; &gt; handing out any research data.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file.

&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I 
would
&gt; &gt; suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a 
whole, in
&gt; &gt; order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can 
for
&gt; &gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip 
(including
&gt; &gt; the experimenter&#x27;s voice), filter or denoise it to make it 
clearer,  
&gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an 
EVP  
&gt; &gt; match
&gt; &gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should 
always
&gt; &gt; be provided along with the edited version.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But that&#x27;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to  
&gt; &gt; express, as
&gt; &gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical 
public.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Stefan
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -- 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these 
files.
&gt; &gt; &gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that
&gt; &gt; &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the 
message
&gt; &gt; &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise 
that
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#x27;t belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can&#x27;t piece 
these
&gt; &gt; &gt; files together to make something it&#x27;s not, so i keep them in 
true
&gt; &gt; &gt; form pretty much to the original.
