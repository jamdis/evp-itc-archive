<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s not so much the spirits that lie, the liars are non-human 
entities, and the often mimic as spirits. You can kinda get a feel for 
who&#x27;s who&#x27;s after some years, but it takes pateience, and not judging 
to harshly. This stuff works in stages, first you have to get past the 
ones that try to frighten you away, then you have to work past the 
liars.....
