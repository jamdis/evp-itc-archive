The other i heard &quot;He&#39;s&quot; and &quot;The Voltage&quot;, but didn&#39;t  catch the \n&quot;Checking&quot; part.  All in all, sounds like a &quot;Frank&#39;s Box&quot; to  me.  Although boxes \nautomate the raw material, i&#39;m finding that other  methods prove success as \nwell.  Even traditional EVP with my Panasonic  rr-dr60 is proving to be a positive \nattribute.  I think once they get in  touch with your life signature or aura \nor whatever they see in us, you can use  any method and get great results.  I \nhave used every box and method known  and have had success with every one, i \nkeep all my files backed up from this  journey for future reference.  My \nproblem is that i don&#39;t stay on one style  of EVP, i keep jumping around to try new \nthings.  I also have another small  project in the works, an idea i passed by \nStefan the other day.  I bought  an old pocket pc off Ebay that i didn&#39;t get \nyet.  It is a bit older and has  a windows CE based program installed on it, \nStefan seems to believe that  EvpMaker might work on that kind of palm pilot \nbecause it is a C+++ designed  program.  Well, in a couple days i will let you \nguys know if it  works.  If it does, it could be a handheld unit to bring out on \nlocation  and it has already proved to work great for me and some other \nresearchers  on here.\n \n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n**************Create a Home Theater Like the Pros.
