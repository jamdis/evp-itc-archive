Dangers which Mankind faces if SPIRICOM is not used wisely\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Since his beginnings, Man has been faced with the fact that\n&gt;&gt; individually and collectively he has the power to act for good or\n&gt;&gt; evil. As his knowledge of the energetic nature of the cosmos has\n&gt;&gt; expanded, Man has found that every energy so far identified -- from\n&gt;&gt; sexual energy to atomic energy -- can be used for his benefit or for\n&gt;&gt; his downfall. He will find that the energies involved in SPIRICOM are\n&gt;&gt; also of a nature that can be used to help him grow mentally and\n&gt;&gt; spiritually and become more God-like (that is more like the beings on\n&gt;&gt; the higher planes) or they can be focused on trivia which will make it\n&gt;&gt; even harder for him to grow out of the present deplorable mess in\n&gt;&gt; which Western civilization&#39;s social, economic and political actions\n&gt;&gt; are tending toward disintegration.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * For the spiritually oriented, we report some advice given by\n&gt;&gt; high level spirit communicators: If SPIRICOM researchers adhere to the\n&gt;&gt; following procedure they will not suffer possession by negative\n&gt;&gt; forces. First thing in the morning say, &quot;I will wear the protective\n&gt;&gt; cloak of the Christ light until I retire tonight.&quot; On retiring make a\n&gt;&gt; similar decree for the night hours. (Note: The Christ light is said to\n&gt;&gt; have overshadowed and inspired Jesus of Nazareth continually during\n&gt;&gt; the last three years of his earth life.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; back to Top of Page\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rhonda W rhondak1973@ wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; LOL crazy as a fox girl!

I have been hanging upside down - out my\n&gt;&gt;&gt; window and about to throw up a ladder and sit on my roof to get better\n&gt;&gt;&gt; reception!!! I have run out of tinfoil... can you spare some?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; AL from o&#39;BAMA: I too always get contradicting answers. Just\n&gt;&gt;&gt; yesterday I was cleaning my pool and listening to my 470 and I heard\n&gt;&gt;&gt; them say &quot;SHE&#39;S USING US FOR ENTERTAINMENT&quot; I replied that I was\n&gt;&gt;&gt; trying to get experience &#39;hearing&#39;. I heard THAT&#39;S GOOD&quot; and I also\n&gt;&gt;&gt; heard &quot;BITCH LEAVE&quot;. I apologized if they felt I was intruding and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; asked if they wanted me to shut down or just the DH&#39;s wanted me too.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I heard &quot;BOTH&quot; and I heard &quot;NO DON&#39;T&quot;. Who do I choose to listen to?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I stayed on for a bit longer - I always err on the side of positive.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If I&#39;m looking for answers to important personal stuff.. I wouldn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ask the box for answers. PS: I once asked if they could read my mind\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and they responded with &quot;OF COURSE NOT&quot; and then proceeded to answer\n&gt;&gt;&gt; my next question before I asked! Go figure :-)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; RHONDA - Are you hearing voice girl??? I knew it! You&#39;re as crazy as\n&gt;&gt;&gt; me!!! LOL... I think that&#39;s cool.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; REES: I really do believe your lost session was very cool. I don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;&gt; believe it&#39;s loss was a coincidence.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; BRUCE: Cool pictures in the Photos Section. Have you ever thought\n&gt;&gt;&gt; about doing a BOX session and a Photo session at the same time and see\n&gt;&gt;&gt; if you could get a photograph of the person talking?? That would be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; an interesting experiement.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; MARGARET: Your knowledge is so emense!

I\n&gt;&gt;&gt; just pray that the universe works it out so that karma is indeed\n&gt;&gt;&gt; something that these people will have to deal with.
