<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>One site I was in had a lot of activity one night.  There were almost 
continuous poppings, clicking and other weird sounds on the recording. 
There were also a lot of EVP that night. Other recordings at the same 
site before and after that one night did not have these noises.

&gt; Louis,
&gt; Could you please comment on the popping sound before an EVP is recorded? Interesting!

&gt; Yes and no Rick. The key word being the CONTEXT of the message(s) recieved. Many of the data being recorded in ITC sessions is in DIRECT answer to the questions being posed. The same can be said of the EVP people are recording as well... Also, there are characteristics of the EVP that in my opinion set them apart from stray radio signals... one is the distinct monotone or &quot;other wordly&quot; sound of the EVP... also, many people record a popping sound seconds before the EVP is recorded...  As far as digital recorders go. I don&#x27;t think anyone has conducted an independent study of which brands are more suseptible to radio interference than others. I think that would have less to do with make and brand and more to do with the the power of a particular 2-way radio...   Louis

&gt; That sounds like an extremely important discovery, Laurie.
&gt; If you have found that recorders are sensitive to some radio
&gt; frequencies, and those recorders and those frequencies have not been
&gt; well tested or documented, then potentially some recorders are also
&gt; senstive to normal AM/FM, as well as other frequencies. This should
&gt; bring into serious question any EVPs people have gotten, unless they
&gt; know those sensitivies beforehand.

&gt;&gt; YES!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We have had cell phones set off our EMF meters.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What made me ban the use of two way radios was when I noticed that
&gt; they were causing interference on the DVRs..
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; they also cause humming and static on some audio recorders - as do
&gt; some cell phones.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For large aeas like Gettysburg, ffort Mifflin, ESP, etc, what we do
&gt; is map out the area ahead of time, with a scheduled rotation of small
&gt; groups. That way we know where everyone is at all times. So far this
&gt; has been successful for us. This method assumes a level of
&gt; responsibility and respect on the part of the investigators - I have
&gt; found that if you are doing an event where others and the public are
&gt; invited it is essential to have them see the schedule and agree to
&gt; abide by it when they sign up and then again when they arrive.

&gt;&gt; Tom,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I own a Motorola Razor. On a recent investigation I had my Razor set
&gt; to vibrate. I recieved a phone call that set off the EMF detector and
&gt; it subsequently &quot;spiked&quot; from the color green to red and did so for
&gt; each vibra signal the the phone was receiving... This false positive
&gt; reading led me to make sure that everyones phone was instead turned
&gt; off entirely.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have also recieved radio interference or bleed over from other
&gt; two-way radios in the area that can be confused as EVP if not
&gt; mentioned when recording audio. Still, I find 2-way radios convenient
&gt; if not necessary for larger scale field investigations. I&#x27;m sure my
&gt; colleagues in the Gettysburg area would agree with me ... but I also
&gt; hear from my friend Bill Murphy that many have resorted to hand held
&gt; GPS systems to mark particular areas of interest when conducting EVP
&gt; or ITC sessions in the field...

&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s interesting Laurie. How have you seen radios like that messing
&gt;&gt; up equipment? What equipment do you think is susceptible to that kind
&gt;&gt; of radio interference?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I know my team when we go out we have two way radios and cellphones
&gt;&gt; so there is no yelling and we are pretty quiet. During the whole in
&gt;&gt; vestigation except prayers.But the only time we had to be loud is when
&gt;&gt; I was attacked.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Im sitting here watching Ghost Hunters...and I know alot of it is
&gt;&gt; done for drama purposes...but Im curious...when ya&#x27;ll are out on an
&gt;&gt; investigation do you talk as much as they do? I can hardly hear
&gt;&gt; anything over them chatting. Also I notice a cpl of their people
&gt;&gt; freak out when they get knocks or other responses... nobody ever says
&gt;&gt; hey thanks for the effort you put into responding or great job or
&gt;&gt; anything like that..its always wtf was that, what the hell is going on
&gt;&gt; in here, etc...do ya&#x27;ll say thanks and compliment the efforts of the
&gt;&gt; responding spirits? Ive never been on an investigation with a team so
&gt;&gt; Im kinda curious how different groups work and run things.(wish I knew
&gt;&gt; people in arizona I could go on an investigation with) I know when I
&gt;&gt; do my research here with my radio shack hack I always say thanks and
&gt;&gt; am polite and have never freaked out or cussed in response to one of
&gt;&gt; the responses Ive gotten. Anyways just curious. Hope everyone has a
&gt;&gt; great weekend!
