Interesting how the technique can produce results even \n&gt;under less then ideal conditions. I&#39;ve been finding several messages in \n&gt;reverse playback with the simple &#39;dial spin&#39;.

There&#39;s no echo box with this, and I&#39;m using\n&gt;only the built in mic on the recorder. I didn&#39;t have quite the right\n&gt;varactors, so the tuning wasn&#39;t very good, and didn&#39;t cover the whole band.\n&gt;I think if I use this with one of the home made tuners, designed for \n&gt;voltage\n&gt;tuning, it might be alot better.\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;It���s tax season, make sure to follow these few simple tips\n&gt;http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Taxes/PreparationTips/PreparationTips.aspx?icid=HMMartagline\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;&lt;&lt; 032807reverseweloveyoumortals.mp3 &gt;&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nIt���s tax season, make sure to follow these few simple tips \nhttp://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Taxes/PreparationTips/PreparationTips.aspx?icid=HMMartagline"}
