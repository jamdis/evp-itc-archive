&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I have been hearing the word &quot; Purple &quot; alot lately in my sessions.
&gt; Does anyone in the group know what it pertains to ? It&#x27;s been bugging
&gt; me alot. Could that be a special group on their side ? I have no clue.
&gt; Also has anyone questioned the voices if they have a last name ? All I
&gt; hear on the RS boxes are first names and haven&#x27;t recieved anyone
&gt; telling me their last name. Does Mike and Lisa have a last name ? Did
&gt; anyone here ever ask the question &quot; Are you Demonic Spirits ? &quot; What
&gt; was their reply if any ? I did one time and got a response saying &quot;
&gt; All of us are &quot;. Don&#x27;t know whether I believe that Spirit or not.
&gt; Probably a Joker saying that. I have asked for specific people for
&gt; them to find so I could talk to and got an answer &quot; We&#x27;re looking. &quot;
&gt; Then I never heard from them after that. I&#x27;m still waiting to be
&gt; contacted by Telephone so far nothing yet. They make me laugh
&gt; sometimes. I had the RS-12-469 on the one day I was just listening to
&gt; what they were chatting about. I found my daughters old Fart Machine
&gt; and was playing with it while the RS radio was running to see if it
&gt; still works which it did. All of a sudden after I made it &quot; Toot &quot; I
&gt; heard a female voice say &quot; Phew !!! .&quot;
&gt; LOL, I guess she thought I really passed one. Also, the other day I
&gt; was on the RS 12-469 and I said &quot; Hello Lisa how are you doing
&gt; today ? &quot; Then a few seconds later I hear a female voice say &quot;
&gt; Bruce ? &quot; like she thought that I was Bruce talking to her. I told her
&gt; no it&#x27;s me Ralph from Harrisburg,PA she replied &quot;Oh, okay fine. &quot; I
&gt; hear all the time voices calling for Lisa she must be a very Popular
&gt; Technician. Oh well I guess it was more than one question LOL. Hey you
&gt; all take care and &quot; Keep the Sweep &quot; a new slogan for here LOL. just
&gt; kidding. You all have a great day.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
