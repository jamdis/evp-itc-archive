<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank,

I&#x27;d heard you were in Littleton -- is there any chance you could take  
a look at this in person and tell me how to fix it? I had a feeling it  
was going to be a serious problem, but since its messed up already I  
guess I have nothing to lose. I could bring it by your place or we  
could meet some where convenient to you if you have a few minutes. I  
have a pointy tipped soldering iron that&#x27;s made for smaller electronic  
stuff and have a background in botanic illustration so I&#x27;m used to  
working on details. If I could get some guidance from you I&#x27;m willing  
to try myself.

What do you think?

&gt; Ouch! That redish colored torn stuff is a circuit trace torn off the
&gt; board, it&#x27;s green colored on top, and copper colored on the
&gt; underside.
&gt;
&gt; Those are surface mount connectors, and wires would have to be
&gt; soldered on the connector tabs, then spliced onto the board. I don&#x27;t
&gt; know if I can solder anything that small with the iron I have.
&gt;
&gt; I hate advertise it, but I&#x27;m in Littleton.

&gt; &gt; Okay, one of my DIY projects this weekend has been to convert my
&gt; &gt; husband&#x27;s old Olympus to infrared. We&#x27;re not extremely talented in
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; electronics area, but we have fun and seem to muddle by. No guts no
&gt; &gt; glory, huh?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, for the most part the operation has been a success. I
&gt; &gt; photographed every step of the way and taped screws and parts to the
&gt; &gt; photos so we&#x27;d know how to rebuild everything we took apart, and
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; has worked just fine. I located the IR filter, removed it and cut
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; replaced it with a piece of glass slide.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The one problem we ran into is that there were two wires that
&gt; appeared
&gt; &gt; to be clipped in place as opposed to being soldered or screwed in
&gt; like
&gt; &gt; everything else. When we tried to pry the clips open, instead the
&gt; &gt; whole thing came off the circuit board. WE HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO
&gt; PROCEED
&gt; &gt; FROM HERE. I don&#x27;t know if we can just glue the darn things down and
&gt; &gt; if so, what type of glue to use, or if we&#x27;re just plain up the
&gt; creek.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I immediately thought of this group of brainy electronics buffs. I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; hoping someone out there can give us some advice, or if you live
&gt; near
&gt; &gt; Highlands Ranch, CO, you could help in person &amp; bail us out of
&gt; this. I
&gt; &gt; was hoping to take this camera to the St. Augustine Lighthouse at
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; end of this coming week.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there any hope? I&#x27;ve posted a photo of an extreme closeup of the
&gt; &gt; clips (one is pink, the other is ivory) and the damaged board -- I
&gt; had
&gt; &gt; to sandwich two photos together to get both in focus at the same
&gt; time
&gt; &gt; (that&#x27;s why it looks that way). For an idea of scale, the clips are
&gt; &gt; both the same size, about 4 mm in width, 4 mm tall, 3 mm deep. Not
&gt; &gt; easy to handle and even harder to see with these middle age eyes.
