I bought \nmy  \n&gt; first reel-to-reel from her husband, back in the day. Sarah had a  \n&gt; bunch of them and her husband was always looking for them at yards  \n&gt; sales to pass onto AAEVP members. He&#39;d get them and fix them up. I  \n&gt; still have the one he got for me. I used several back them myself \nand  \n&gt; had three or four when I had to pause in taping for the birth of \nmy  \n&gt; son. It took me many years to get back to it...\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; On Oct 9, 2008, at 10:35 PM, judy_in_hollywood wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi All, Been awhile since I&#39;ve posted here, but was wondering \nabout  \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; methods Sarah used with her reel to reel tape recorder (Technics \nor\n&gt; &gt; Teac model - anyone know which???) as it seems she got MANY Spirit\n&gt; &gt; voices or EVP&#39;s this way. Not to knock, Frank&#39;s Boxes or other \nGhost\n&gt; &gt; Boxes! Just a though! I may have an opportunity to get a $160.\n&gt; &gt; refurbised Teac or Technics reel to reel tape recorder, but am\n&gt; &gt; wondering IF I should get it or not (it&#39;s a 1970&#39;s model \nappearently)!\n&gt; &gt; Comments/ideas? Thanks! =Judy= 8-D\n&gt; &gt; = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi, Lisby!  Were you able to get some EVP&#39;s on any of those \nrecorders? Was it too time consuming to even get one or two? Just \nwondering IF I should just stick to cassettes & Sony, and my digital \nrecorder?   =Judy=\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
