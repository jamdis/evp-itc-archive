      Come on! Everyone is worth something to someone. She was like so many=
 others who put a lot of stock into this type of communication. As fantasti=
c and incredible as it is, it is not perpect. Far from it. There are so man=
y layers of entities out thier that you can connect to depending on your at=
titude and disposition. Honestly, I agree with her that she is not cut out =
for this. Otherwise she may have gotten herself into a bad place with the w=
rong ones. Not evil...just wrong!
