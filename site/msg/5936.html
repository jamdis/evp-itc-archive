Babs,
 
You know it's really amazing,
any time you decide to pop up here 
=
It always seems you have an issue with something.
 
this time it's files wi=
thout questions, the length of the RS scan
blah blah blah.
 
Didn't your ma=
ma tell you "If you can't say nothin nice don't say nothin at all"
I'm sure=
 we could all do without your bi monthly criticism.

Alright, you all kn=
ow I'm vocal and I haven't made any "friends" herebut, if we can put that a=
side for a moment...Spirit communication has been my passion since day one,=
 a little over6 years ago. I am a believer in the afterlife and a believer =
inspirits attempting to communicate with us for a variety of reasons. Ihave=
 spiritual beliefs that I feel strongly about and devote much ofmy waking (=
and sleeping) moments to thoughts about this field.However, I am also a res=
earcher and a skeptic. In order for me toallow ideas to become part of my r=
eality I must experiment. In orderfor me to believe something is paranormal=
 I HAVE to rule out all otherpossible causes. That being said, I have some =
questions. My hope isthat there are some here willing to enter into discuss=
ion with me.I have a difficult time with many of the files here. Many times=
, thereis no question included in the file. I can not determine whether orn=
ot the "reply" is an intelligent reply. Maybe this has to do withallowable =
file size.Some of the files I have been able to download. (I don't always k=
eepmy email settings on for this group as I get too many - lol) When Ilook =
at the file I see problems. There will be complete flat linesilence between=
 the words. Many times the "reply" is also at the samedecibel as the questi=
on askers voice. Those two things should notoccur naturally considering the=
 devices being used. That tells me thatthere is manipulation of the files. =
Now, what is manipulation to me,may not be manipulation to others. To me, a=
ny altering of the recordedfile constitutes manipulation. I do not know if =
the reply wasintelligent or manipulated to be intelligent. Some say that th=
ey simply remove the "no response" time. I've beentold it can be as much as=
 18 seconds removed from between words. Nowwe run into the problem of us de=
ciding what word fits in with thequestion. What words are being ignored? Di=
d we take nonsense and makesense? Did we amp every noise/word or only what =
fit?I think it's great that files are offered for peer review. However, Ith=
ink we have to load them untouched or at the very least, offerexactly what =
was done to the entire file. Time elapsed between words,what was amped, etc=
. I'd also love to see some of these sessions videotaped with the question =
asker facing the camera and a second handclock visible. Truly, we aren't re=
searching if we don't have someprotocol in place.Here is an issue I have wi=
th the RS Hacks. I have the 469. It takesapproximately 18 seconds to scan t=
hrough the AM frequencies. Now, thetypical person would think that we can t=
ake that 18 seconds and divideit by the number of AM stations to determine =
how long we are on eachstation before moving on to the next one. In that wa=
y we coulddetermine what is impossible to be said via a radio fragment. How=
ever,that's not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one frequency to then=
ext and of course the biggest problem is that some stations arepicked up ov=
er multiple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard on 630, 640,650, 660 and maybe=
 even 670. That extends the time a great deal. Thisis a difficult problem b=
ecause it is almost impossible for the averageperson to be able to make a d=
etermination on time this way. I heard about the following today; An experi=
menter records at the sametime every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importa=
nce of meditating,automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but wha=
t we have toremember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning into t=
he sameradio show every day. One of my first experiments with the 469 had m=
ehearing this deep male voice over and over again. What was he tryingto tel=
l me, I wondered. Than I realized that he was speakingapproximately every 1=
8 seconds; every time the scan hit that station.So, if you are removing up =
to 18 seconds between words, then you arereally only recording the words fr=
om one station. This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides dis=
cussionabout some research problems. I know that there are those who are no=
tconcerned with anything more than the communication itself but I thinkthat=
 it is of the utmost importance to attempt to factor in someprotocol in ord=
er for this to be considered serious research at all.
