<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Nope not makin that one I&#x27;m working all weekend. I checked the roster about a month ago and looked interesting if you are a fan of some of the TAPS members who are attending or one of the other guests.

You live close? I&#x27;m not that far from there maybe an hour if I get lost(or 2 lookin for a place to park LOL)

Feeds might be cool depending on what information they are sharing with the public. I may check in to see if they got them up later.

&gt; I tried sending this yesterday (Friday), but I guess it
&gt; didn&#x27;t go through. &quot;I know how some people feel
&gt; about the TAPS guys, but is anyone going to TAPSCON (
&gt; http://tapscon.com/ ) in Clearwater, Florida this
&gt; weekend? I can&#x27;t make it on Saturday, since I have to
&gt; work, but I&#x27;m thinking about going on Sunday. If you go
&gt; to the site it has a live feed (which I plan to watch at
&gt; work) and its venue, etc. There&#x27;s going to be all
&gt; kinds of different stuff, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s
&gt; worth the money. I think it&#x27;d be interesting to go
&gt; though.&quot;
