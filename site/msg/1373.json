I&#39;ll be interested to see what \n&gt; rolls in through the TAPS magazine.  The issue will be featured \nnext \n&gt; weekend at the next Ghost Hunters haunted event, at Eastern State \n&gt; Penitentiary in Philly.  People will be getting it, and it&#39;s sure \nto \n&gt; generate some converation. (Bill, Randy & I will be there).  BTW, \n&gt; Randy alerted me that the hot link for the pdf includes a period \n&gt; which makes it not work, and I don&#39;t know how to edit the original \n&gt; post, so I would suggest highlighting & cutting the period out.  My \n&gt; apologies.  I fixed it on itcbridge.com under Forum/EVP/Ghost Box.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Rosemary\n&gt; \n&gt; -- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;phaser_2000&quot; &lt;phaser2000@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rosemary,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   I ditto what Frank says here!

The articles are published this \nmonth \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;TAPS Paramagazine.  The pdf can be viewed at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;http://spiritfaces.com/x200706ParamagArticl.pdf.  For those \nnot \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ghost work, TAPS is The Paranormal Atlantic Society, members \nof \n&gt; whom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;star in The SciFiChannel&#39;s  popular Ghost Hunters reality show.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Briefly, at a Ghost Hunters haunted week at The Stanley Hotel \nin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Colorado in March, the 200+ attendees were given \ndemonstrations \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the box by Chris Moon.  There were two open mike nights in \nwhich \n&gt; lots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;were drawn for people to come up and ask questions via the box.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Chris interpreted answers, and was assisted by medium Chip \n&gt; Coffey.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Many of the attendees had never heard of the box, and most of \n&gt; them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;had never seen it in operation, and it caused quite a stir.   \n&gt; Chris\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;also took the box into one of the hotel&#39;s more active haunted \n&gt; rooms,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;as part of the featured ghost investigations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;There were two other boxes present on site for part of the \ntime,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;owned by Randy Schneider and Bill Murphy.  Fortunately, these \n&gt; boxes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;were not pressed into service for paranormal tap dancing.  I \nwas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;especially happy to be able to participate in small group \nprivate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sessions with both Randy and Bill (and one of which included \n&gt; Mark),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;which I found far more illuminating.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;One article concerns the controversy over the box (for example,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;should it be used in haunted places to provoke ghosts; can it \n&gt; dial up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the dead on demand), and the other is a Q&A interview I did \nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Frank.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Personally, I agree with Frank&#39;s vision for the box as an ITC \n&gt; tool.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Rosemary Ellen Guiley\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n_________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hotmail to go?
