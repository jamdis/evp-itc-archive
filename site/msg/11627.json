Musical notes, snippets\n&gt; of dialogue in \n&gt; &gt;multiple languages, allophones, crowd noise, me saying\n&gt; &quot;the quick\n&gt; &gt;brown fox..&quot; pangram worked very well. If you want\n&gt; I can send you a\n&gt; &gt;few that have worked for me or upload them to my\n&gt; esnips.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, please email them to me off list!  Of post them in a\n&gt; file.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d love to experiment. \n&gt; \n&gt; Blessings,\n&gt; \n&gt; Becca"}
