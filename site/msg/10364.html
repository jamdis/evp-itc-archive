<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have a speaking susnicion you are right and anyone who seems &quot;possessed&quot; 
was so before the box use.

I&#x27;m still confused about the threats, though.  Were they on this group or 
in private?  I haven&#x27;t seen any physical threats posted here unless I fell 
asleep halfway thru reading an e-mail (which I&#x27;ve been known to do now and 
then lately).

&gt; provider. I don&#x27;t want to go there again.
&gt;
&gt; I have to ask, or wish I could ask, if these people are possessed
&gt; before, or after box use? I suspect it&#x27;s before, I hope it&#x27;s before,
&gt; or I have some serious karma to deal with.
&gt;
&gt; It is a federal crime to threaten and intimidate using e-mail and
&gt; the internet, and the FBI does have an on-line reporting center. It&#x27;s
&gt; title 18 something.

&gt;&gt; Hi Frank,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I know this is all stupid and some of us have really had enough of
&gt; it.
&gt;&gt; Especially being called childish names and being swore at and
&gt; threatened.  But it
&gt;&gt; hasn&#x27;t stopped in private emails?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is such the case.  And now it has come down to physical
&gt; threats  because
&gt;&gt; well maybe that&#x27;s all these neanderthals know or can understand.
&gt; ANd yes it
&gt;&gt; has been reported to the proper authorities but what do you
&gt; recommend  be
&gt;&gt; done about iy.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Your opinion would be greatly appreiated.

&gt;&gt; Huh!? I can only say, I don&#x27;t have to do this group thing either,
&gt; I
&gt;&gt; stay cuz a few request it. The guys actually talk more if I don&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; share.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I can understand where Bruce was coming fom, to a point,  but when
&gt;&gt; you start making threatening private e-mails to make sure  everyone
&gt;&gt; agrees with you, that&#x27;s just demented and wrong. This shit ain&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; that important!
