All files listed  \n&gt; in order with numbers much like yahoo group files...clicked on one  \n&gt; file...wainted a bit and the session was played...didn&#39;t have to do  \n&gt; anything else until I wanted to replay.  I still like it.  Still  \n&gt; can&#39;t get into Ann&#39;s files...nothing personal.

All of your files are listed with an icon that looks like  \n&gt; a square with a microphone and a CD. It is the only clickable  \n&gt; thing--I can&#39;t click the title of the clip, for example. When I  \n&gt; click it, nothing ever happens. I looks like it is loading but  \n&gt; nothing comes of it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve had this problem with esnips since it first started up. I have  \n&gt; never yet been able to get any clip of any length by anyone to ever  \n&gt; load.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;\n&gt; On Feb 1, 2008, at 2:33 PM, bruce halliday wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ann,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Which icon are you talking about?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; bruce\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; From: lisby@...\n&gt;&gt; Date: Fri, 1 Feb 2008 13:07:46 -0500\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] ok here we are I posted a bunch of new  \n&gt;&gt; RS470 files to esnips\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Bruce, the job of the day is figure out why I get nothing  \n&gt;&gt; when I click on the icon.
