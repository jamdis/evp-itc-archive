<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ron.  There&#x27;s plenty of room for long clips if people would change their software 
settings, as well as post in MP3 format rather than WAV. 

Hi LK.  I would add, &#x27;disclose when you have edited&#x27;, so others aren&#x27;t mislead by your 
results.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; Here&#x27;s my take.or 2 cents worth..:-)
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Share your files all clipped without the garbage for others to listen to.
&gt; Save your original files for further development and records, in the case a
&gt; scientific organization wants to &quot;hear&quot; the original along with the clipped,
&gt; walahh you have both. And everyone is Happy!

&gt; Bruce    To add to what you said, the capacity of the yahoo forum we are
&gt; with does not permit long recordings and the messages we have been receiving
&gt; seem to be getting longer and longer each passing month.  Not much room for
&gt; the &quot;gargage.&quot;  I for one prefer to hear the important message words,
&gt; knowing full well the author edited the file.  If someone wants to present
&gt; false stuff so that he or she gets false praise from us,  god bless them if
&gt; they need the praise.  For scientific research with original files...that&#x27;s
&gt; another story.  Ron L

&gt; Stefan,

&gt; I do remove the &quot;garbage&quot; from my files.
&gt;  
&gt; At this point in my research, the message is more important to me than the
&gt; proof of it.
&gt; I think most of us here will agree that we are receiving some sort of
&gt; paranormal communication.
&gt; but it definitely exists. now we need to concentrate on the messages they
&gt; need us to hear and the answers to the questions
&gt; we ask and in turn our answers to their questions. Anyone that cleans a file
&gt; in this way should not be touching any bit of the file
&gt; that has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously garbage like
&gt; the &quot;EH O EH AH O EH UR&quot; in between words.
&gt;  
&gt; For example &quot;Is there anyone here that wishes to communicate_YES_AH ER EEH
&gt; AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE&quot;
&gt; It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return to a file that
&gt; I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold some
&gt; relivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly listen to it,
&gt; without the distraction of the garbage sounds.
&gt;  
&gt; At this stage in real time communication the messages are the top priority.
&gt; I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained and made
&gt; available to individuals that make a request 
&gt; for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may be made,
&gt; and god knows there are always fanatical 
&gt; sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to attack an unwary
&gt; or injured researcher. I do not think that 
&gt; our research files should be made available on request by every tom dick and
&gt; harry that is unknown to us and may potentially
&gt; doctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such.
&gt;  
&gt; I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the researcher that
&gt; receives the request for raw research data should 
&gt; scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment before handing
&gt; out any research data.
&gt;  
&gt; These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file.

&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP
&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I would
&gt; suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, in
&gt; order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can for
&gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including
&gt; the experimenter&#x27;s voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, but
&gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP match
&gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should always
&gt; be provided along with the edited version.
&gt; 
&gt; But that&#x27;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to express, as
&gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical public.
&gt; 
&gt; Stefan
&gt; 
&gt; -- 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these files.
&gt; &gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that 
&gt; &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the message 
&gt; &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise that 
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can&#x27;t piece these 
&gt; &gt; files together to make something it&#x27;s not, so i keep them in true 
&gt; &gt; form pretty much to the original.
