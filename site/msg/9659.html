<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Everyone,

Anyone that is interested in using the sound soap program with the 
allaphone file method to do sessions. Here is a short explination of 
the process.

I also would like to thank my colleuge Steve Hultay for posting the 
step by step instructions for using EVP maker with the allaphone file.

As Steve has offered, So will I. If anyone wants the sound soap 
program just e-mail me and I will send it to you.

To use the sound soap method, 

1.Open sound soap

2.top menu bar click FILE, on the drop down menu click on 
&quot;open media file&quot;

3.When the OPEN FILE window comes up, go to the folder with the 
allaphone file and double click the file.

4.Set all features on the sound soap control panel to the &quot;off&quot; 
position. There are are two up and down slide bars, left side is 
for &quot;REMOVE CLICK AND CRACKLE&quot; the right side is for &quot;ENHANCE&quot; both 
OFF. There are  two round dials a right and left, make sure they are 
slid all the way &quot;COUNTER CLOCKWISE&quot;

5.DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING IN THE OVAL SHAPED PANEL.

6.The play bar has two buttons back to back on the left side, the 
left button is for returning the file to the beggining. The right 
button with the arrow is the play button. On the right side of the 
play bar there is a button labeled apply. do not touch it.

7.To use the program and do a session, click on the play button, when 
the file begins to play click the moving slider arrow on the bottom 
of the play bar and hold down your left mouse button. Thios allows 
you to &quot;DRAG THE SLIDER ARROW BACK AND FORTH ALONG THE PLAY BAR&quot;


This will facilitae manually scrambling the order the file plays in 
which allows our spirit friends to manipulate the tones into words.

Remember to record your sessions! 
I will be posting a tutorial on how to go over a recording shortly.
