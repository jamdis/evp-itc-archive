They then say DONT LEAVE YET. I even hear\n&gt; them say HURRY! \n&gt; There is some more back and forth while we try to get everyone back\n&gt; over. I must drive them crazy because on playback I hear done complete\n&gt; and here a bunch but eventually I here them and end the session.\n&gt; Its over at ESNIPS because the file is too large for here.\n&gt; Check it out: \n&gt; http://www.esnips.com/doc/6a4f2cc7-749c-4758-b5e4-de25fbe1c4c4/DONT-\nLEAVE-YET-ONE-MORE-HURRY-DONE-COMPLETE-HERE\n&gt; I hope the link works.\n&gt; k\n&gt;"}
