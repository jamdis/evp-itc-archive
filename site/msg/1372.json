I&#39;ll be interested to see what \nrolls in through the TAPS magazine.  The issue will be featured next \nweekend at the next Ghost Hunters haunted event, at Eastern State \nPenitentiary in Philly.  People will be getting it, and it&#39;s sure to \ngenerate some converation. (Bill, Randy & I will be there).  BTW, \nRandy alerted me that the hot link for the pdf includes a period \nwhich makes it not work, and I don&#39;t know how to edit the original \npost, so I would suggest highlighting & cutting the period out.  My \napologies.  I fixed it on itcbridge.com under Forum/EVP/Ghost Box.\n\n--Rosemary\n\n-- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;phaser_2000&quot; &lt;phaser2000@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Rosemary,\n&gt; \n&gt;   I ditto what Frank says here!

The articles are published this month \nin\n&gt; &gt; &gt;TAPS Paramagazine.  The pdf can be viewed at\n&gt; &gt; &gt;http://spiritfaces.com/x200706ParamagArticl.pdf.  For those not \nin\n&gt; &gt; &gt;ghost work, TAPS is The Paranormal Atlantic Society, members of \nwhom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;star in The SciFiChannel&#39;s  popular Ghost Hunters reality show.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Briefly, at a Ghost Hunters haunted week at The Stanley Hotel in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Colorado in March, the 200+ attendees were given demonstrations \nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the box by Chris Moon.  There were two open mike nights in which \nlots\n&gt; &gt; &gt;were drawn for people to come up and ask questions via the box.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Chris interpreted answers, and was assisted by medium Chip \nCoffey.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Many of the attendees had never heard of the box, and most of \nthem\n&gt; &gt; &gt;had never seen it in operation, and it caused quite a stir.   \nChris\n&gt; &gt; &gt;also took the box into one of the hotel&#39;s more active haunted \nrooms,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;as part of the featured ghost investigations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;There were two other boxes present on site for part of the time,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;owned by Randy Schneider and Bill Murphy.  Fortunately, these \nboxes\n&gt; &gt; &gt;were not pressed into service for paranormal tap dancing.  I was\n&gt; &gt; &gt;especially happy to be able to participate in small group private\n&gt; &gt; &gt;sessions with both Randy and Bill (and one of which included \nMark),\n&gt; &gt; &gt;which I found far more illuminating.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;One article concerns the controversy over the box (for example,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;should it be used in haunted places to provoke ghosts; can it \ndial up\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the dead on demand), and the other is a Q&A interview I did with\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Frank.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Personally, I agree with Frank&#39;s vision for the box as an ITC \ntool.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Rosemary Ellen Guiley\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Hotmail to go?
