It has a lot of features I&#39;ve heard\nBruce mention that would be beneficial to the boxes.  \n\nHell, I&#39;ve been trying my best to locate an older 12-470 to modify so\nI could start doing the research.  I know there is the 12-469, but\nI&#39;ve been hesitant because of all the talk about the annoying click. \n\nJeremy"}
