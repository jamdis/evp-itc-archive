You asked several questions=

1) you hope what? that i made a fool ou=
t of myself or that i called it in or perhaps both?=C2=A0 

I hope you call=

ught you had on a child abductor, even after several prompts, makes me hope=
 you did call it in, and didn't just say that to stop me from prompting you=
. I don't know of course, I am not there. I have no desire that you make a =
fool of yourself, but if it helps save a child from am abductor, I think it=
 would be worth it.

2) Why don't you get on the box, and do some asking? 
=

As I have said in the past, my experience with those boxes has shown me no=
thing paranormal yet.=C2=A0 However, people continue to say there is more t=

 to examine the evidence you provide.

3) Why are negative people on
 these=
 lists anyway. if you guys don't believe in this type of technology, why th=
e heck are you all here? 

If I had absolulely no belief that there might b=
e something interesting going on with the technology, I would not have been=
 so insistent that you give your information to the police.=C2=A0 How could=
 a person, of good conscience, not prompt you to give that information to t=
he police?=C2=A0 Again how is that a negative thing to do?

Wouldn't the re=
