<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Heard the 17th. This is an interesting box, Frank--not your usual. When did you build it? I&#x27;ve not been keeping close tabs on the GBC stuff the last year, so I guess I missed seeing this one. Got any more files from it?

&gt;  Keep getting the 17th, over an over, presumably a date, but what month,
&gt; what year, and even RoboBox answered a question @ 16 seconds
&gt; &quot;seven--teenth---true&quot;., they almost never answer question, and it was a
&gt; surprised to hear something answered on RoboBox.

&gt;  I been getting wormwood and planet x almost constantly if I leave a box on,
&gt; which I just started doing while I work.

&gt; BTW, dropped out for a while, just too damn many psychos in this field,
