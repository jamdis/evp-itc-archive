<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Angela,

If you are looking to get started with a simple ghost box, i would 
suggest a 20-125 model by radio shack.  It incorporates a speaker and 
is able to sweep AM, FM and shortwave.  The simple procedure is on my 
site.

http://www.keyportparanormal.com/simpleghostboxhack.html

Other models that are available for the hack are as follows:

12-469 (New Model White)---Pull the Mute pin off the board once 
opened.

20-125 --- Cut wire on ribbon going to the &quot;Mute&quot; markings on the 
board.

12-820 --- Cut wire going to &quot;Mute&quot; on the board

12-150 --- Cut Wire going to &quot;Mute&quot; on the board.  This is my latest 
find and is a bit harder to get at the wiring, but can be done.  It 
also incorporates a built in speaker.

12-469 and 12-820 will need an external speaker, but they come with 
earbuds.  I use a 21-549 speaker from radio shack, it works well and 
is fairly inexpensive.

&gt; Hi Angela
&gt; 
&gt; LOL! Why dont they just give the winning lotto numbers that would 
be 
&gt; easier to aquire =)
&gt; 
&gt; Personally I never seek to prove this to anyone, they should 
&gt; prove/disprove it themselves. Even amongst those who arent 
skeptics, 
&gt; hearing varies. Sometimes everyones hears the same sometimes they 
&gt; dont. 
&gt; 
&gt; I also dont ask about lotto numbers LOL I dont play it.
&gt; 
&gt; As for building one yourself, most are trying out the radio 
&gt; modifications like the 12-470 or the 12-469 (horrible clicking on 
the 
&gt; 469 model but a few have gotten around it. Theres a few others 
Frank 
&gt; and Steve have messed with. I think ones the 12-125 but I am a bit 
&gt; tired so all the model numbers arent popping in my head at the 
moment.
&gt; 
&gt; A few &quot;how to&quot; videos have been posted on youtube. You can type in 
&gt; the model numbers to access a few of Mike Colletta&#x27;s (ufogeek)
&gt; available posts as well as several others who have made thier video 
&gt; instructions available online. 
&gt; 
&gt; I did try out a fan test session the other day. Tho they werent as 
&gt; loud as with water, I could still discern a few statements. They 
were 
&gt; so &quot;bass&quot; in tone that its almost out of my hearing range on a few 
so 
&gt; I didnt post them all. As for the ones I did they can be found on 
my 
&gt; esnips 
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.esnips.com/web/MiscellaneousMethodsofEVP
&gt; 
&gt; That should take ya to the right folder

&gt; &gt; Hi everyone, 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m sure lots of you know who James Randi is, the skeptic who 
&gt; offers $1 
&gt; &gt; million for proof of the paranormal. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am wondering why there hasn&#x27;t been an EVP demonstration good 
&gt; enough 
&gt; &gt; to win the prize. I have never captured an EVP, but many people 
&gt; have 
&gt; &gt; including those in this group. I cannot say (like James Randi 
&gt; &gt; apparently and others like him) that I think every person who 
&gt; captured 
&gt; &gt; an EVP is a fraud or captured a fluke or something like that. I 
&gt; don&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; think that at all, it appears to me that many of them are the 
real 
&gt; &gt; deal, of that I am almost 100% certain and will be 100% certain 
if 
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; can ever capture my own. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know a lot about James Randi or EVP for that matter, but 
it 
&gt; is 
&gt; &gt; a question that came up. Can anyone enlighten me? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I tried a few sessions last night but came up empty handed. I am 
&gt; &gt; starting to think my white noise isn&#x27;t loud enough. I&#x27;m going to 
&gt; keep 
&gt; &gt; trying. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also I hope to experiment with ITC images. And soon I want to 
build 
&gt; &gt; a &quot;box&quot; which I keep hearing so much about. I don&#x27;t know the 
first 
&gt; &gt; thing about these ghost/spirit boxes as I&#x27;ve heard them called, 
all 
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; know is I want to learn to build one and use it as I&#x27;ve heard 
some 
&gt; &gt; interesting audio files here. But that&#x27;s probably a good subject 
&gt; for a 
&gt; &gt; separate post unless anyone can give me an informative how-to 
link 
&gt; or 
&gt; &gt; anything. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
&gt; &gt; Angela
