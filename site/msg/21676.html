Is anyone else noticing any similarities or correlati=
ons between the

names of the technicians on some of the boxes/radios we al=
l use and the

names of prophets, saints, angels, or apostles in Christiani=
ty (and some

other religions)? I now know three people with a technician n=
amed

"David," one with one named "Thomas" or "Tom" and I've been hearing t=
he

name "Tom" and "Thomas" and "Stephen." On another device I use, kind of=


like an ovilus, I get "Michael" and "John." Now, my dad's name is Tom

an=
d my bother's name is Stephen, so it does seem kind of obvious that

these =
are names of other people as well, like those who have lived

before and ar=
e living now. However, it's too coincidental  for me to

ignore that these =
are very specific names of prophets, holy men, angels,

and apostles, as we=
ll.



Has anyone else ever had any theories on this?
