We live in the middle of a lot of acreage, so neighbors and remotes were not an option, only faulty motherboards or whatever.  It stopped for a couple of years, and started again when my brother died this last December.  Then, recently, my mom had brought the Tom Tom GPS into the house and set it on the counter, turned off and unplugged.  It scared her to death when it suddenly turned itself on later in the afternoon and declared she should turn left.  \n\nSo yes, I can see them turning the radio on and off by themselves.\n\nBTW, thanks to all for the very kind welcome here, and the patient answering to my questions.  I&#39;m very grateful!  Now I must work on transferring my tapes to the computer so I can share what I&#39;ve recorded with you all.  I surely enjoy listening to what you guys post, and comparing it to my messages.  It&#39;s very helpful.\n\nJill"}
