I can tell you stories of tiny crazy ants to ants as large as half your thumb...tried all kinds of things like chlorine...acid...but a hand full of cheap, cheap, blue laundry detergent mixed in water will kill ants on the spot...dead, done, gone, ready for an EVP session.  What a blessing since I am highly allergic to all pesticides.  Getting ants out of an electrical system is another matter.  I have them running along by house electrical lines and must wait for them to show their face before I soap em.
