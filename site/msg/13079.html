Sometimes the groups I&#x27;ve been with do a lot of chatting but we try to 
keep it quiet when looking for EVP. We always start out by saying we&#x27;re 
not there to hurt or damage anyone and we thank whomever for any responses 
we get and at the end thank them for letting us be there. Even if we 
didn&#x27;t get any sort of a response.

I don&#x27;t know why the dumb comments when they hear a sound or get some sort 
of a response. You&#x27;d think that since they are in a supposedly haunted 
place, they&#x27;d expect and be looking for odd noises, etc. But then again 
it&#x27;s TV-land.
