The best results i \nhave had was using the line out cable and the mic feature that you \nbuilt into it.  When i played it back it seem to have a lot less \nnoise.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Try using an external speaker, and/or sound chamber. The small \n&gt; internal chamber will tend to accentuate the higher noise \nfrequencies-\n&gt; -I think. I have the same system using the same chip, and use a \n&gt; really large external box with it. The echo box is nothing but an \n&gt; enclosure with a speaker on one side, and the mic on the other--use \n&gt; electret mic elements and 8 ohm speakers. The are jacks for \nexternal \n&gt; mic and speaker on #27. That&#39;s why I included that function. That \n&gt; chip&#39;s output is also very noisy, I don&#39;t know how to make it \nbetter. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All the files are rough from this box, what really sucks is they \n&gt; &gt; answer me every time and i just can&#39;t hear them over all the \n&gt; noise.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday \n&gt; &gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Steve,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m hearing &quot;accepts us Frank sumption&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The file is a little rough.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: EVP-ITC@: EVP-ITC@: Sun, 13 Jan 2008 21:05:21 \n&gt; &gt; +0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,This email message is a notification to let you know \nthata \n&gt; &gt; file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; &gt; group.File : /Steve Hultay Files/Steve Hultay&#39;s Frank&#39;s Box \n&gt; &gt; #27/it_sucks---frank_sumption.mp3 Uploaded by : urkel232002 \n&gt; &gt; &lt;urkel23@&gt; Description : &quot;It Sucks Frank Sumption&quot;---Sorry Frank \ni \n&gt; &gt; was trying out the RVG on FM and this is what the file sounds \nlike \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; me.
