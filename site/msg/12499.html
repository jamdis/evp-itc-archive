<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, the concept of a Dybbuk is a bit different than the popular 
concept of &quot;posession&quot;.  It usually involves a soul that has not 
accomplished something they were supposed to and cannot advance 
further, so they return and bind with the living to do it.  Its 
considered a rare occurance and usually only acknowledged or dealt 
with by some of the orthodoxy.

ever  
&gt; complained about possession. They just think the idea is silly.

&gt; &gt; yes, its not considered a commonly seen occurance. Certainly 
nowhere
