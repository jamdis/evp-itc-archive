I spent the morning cleaning out\n&gt; &gt; wav files to clear up space and those postings just took up over 23% of the\n&gt; &gt; groups file storage space because you used wav format and not mp3. If you\n&gt; &gt; must post wav format or tons of files use esnips or attach to email posts as\n&gt; &gt; file attachment.

I used my trusty\n&gt; &gt; RS\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 20-125, and Goldwave for the recording, I did not do any type of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; filtering, except to lower or raise the volume where it needed. You can\n&gt; &gt; see them in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my folder if you want to listen to them later but I&#39;ll post an attachment\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; firstly, then you tell me which should if any go into my folder.
