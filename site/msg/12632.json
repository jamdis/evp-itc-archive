Some posts are made via email \nwith attchments and the only way to recieve files that are attached \nto posts is to put your settings on individual email.\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 10/28/08, Allen &lt;amuck944@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Allen &lt;amuck944@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: almost too embarassed to post this, but....\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, October 28, 2008, 3:20 PM\n&gt; &gt; I had the same problem.  I broke down and changed my setting\n&gt; &gt; so now I\n&gt; &gt;  get individual emails from the group.  That solved the\n&gt; &gt; problem for me.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Allen \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ourobouros2k2&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;ourobouros2k2@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, when someone posts a non-stored embedded soundclip\n&gt; &gt; or video, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; find it to be non-clickable. I am forced to run latest\n&gt; &gt; version of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; firefox, but at work with ie6 I have the same issue.\n&gt; &gt; How do I open\n&gt; &gt; &gt; these post attachments? I am sure the answer is\n&gt; &gt; painfully obvious, so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; here is a preemptive &quot;d&#39;oh!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Andy\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
