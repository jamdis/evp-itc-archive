I see his daughters last name is Huff, and his fathers \nlast \n&gt; name is Huff... so why isn&#39;t his, Chris&#39;, last name Huff?  Anyone \ngot \n&gt; the 411 on this a.k.a.?\n&gt; \n&gt; Here are the three articles I found:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://ghostofcoast.blogspot.com/2007/03/i-smell-another-scam-about-\nto-\n&gt; happen.html  (See comment at end of article)\n&gt; \n&gt; \nhttp://www.mscd.edu/~themet/TheMetropolitan/06_07/Vol29_issue30/metros\npe\n&gt; ctive/haunting.html\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.masonhouseinn.com/Joy&#39;s%20Journal%202006_happenings.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt;"}
