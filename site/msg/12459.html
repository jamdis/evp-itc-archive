<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I never claimed to be the first on the RS hack, i just posted the 
first files from it.  I have no ego and have many friends on here 
that could attest to that, i educate what i have learned along the 
way and that&#x27;s all.  No recording duels here, nobody cares anyway.  
What would that serve?  I only have helped people on here and other 
boards.

&gt; Actually I don&#x27;t know you and therefore can&#x27;t
&gt; say if I like you or not. I will say that I&#x27;ve heard
&gt; who first came up with the RS Hack and your
&gt; name wasn&#x27;t it.
&gt; 
&gt; I have posted many of my recordings to this
&gt; list, but don&#x27;t store them here. I&#x27;ve also heard
&gt; your files. So? Nothing I haven&#x27;t heard before,
&gt; but as always I enjoy listening to everyone&#x27;s efforts.
&gt; 
&gt; What I don&#x27;t like is an attitude and egomania
&gt; when it comes to this research.
&gt; 
&gt; Next I guess you&#x27;ll challenge me to a recording
&gt; duel? LOL. Give that ego a rest.

&gt; &gt; You&#x27;re right and i&#x27;m not here to argue with anyone. You obviously
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t know me, but dislike me. That&#x27;s ok, i like to get along with
&gt; &gt; people; it helps the research move forward. I would love to hear 
some
&gt; &gt; of your files from your frank&#x27;s boxes and compare notes on what 
we&#x27;ve
&gt; &gt; been getting. My results are in the files section here.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So have I. So has Misty. So has Frank. Mike too. I could go on 
&amp; on.
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are many here and on other lists who have contributed 
years of
&gt; &gt; &gt; free time way before you showed up on the recording scene.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Does it matter? No.
