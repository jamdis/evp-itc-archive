<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>if you took the photos with your own camera he cannot say crap. all he can do is ask you.there is no legal issue about it its your camera and your pictures,so you have the right to do what you want with them.

&gt; I have a legal question that I cannot seem to find an answer to. I recently
&gt; went on an investigation to a public place with a  paranormal group. While
&gt; my experience is much less than theirs, I found them to be too disorganized.
&gt; Three people came from the group. One had no equipment and the second used
&gt; his cell phone. I never even saw a pencil. So, I started a small group,
&gt; specifically for amateur investigators staying in local public places so we
&gt; don&#x27;t get in over our heads. We aren&#x27;t trying to get any resident
&gt; investigations and are non competitive. On our site I put photos and evps I
&gt; had gotten while on the investigation and put at the bottom that some
&gt; evidence was obtained while on investigations with other groups. I didn&#x27;t
&gt; use any of their names. As with any of my photos, I blocked out any faces,
&gt; and it was all on my equipment. I signed nothing and agreed to nothing.
&gt; Yesterday he sent me an email saying he wants it taken down. It&#x27;s
&gt; technically and legally his ( technically and legally?). If I wanted to
&gt; start my own group all I had to do was ask. He has said that I invited a 16
&gt; year old to join the group (Definitely didn&#x27;t). And that he thought I would
&gt; join their group.
&gt; -I don&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s right on the legal issue. Ethically, I would have
&gt; accredited the group if he was more diplomatic and maybe even taken it down.
&gt; 
&gt; - wouldn&#x27;t making false accusations make him guilty of liable?
&gt; - I don&#x27;t need to ask him to do ****. I&#x27;ve met him twice.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody know of any place where I can find something written on the law
&gt; about those photos and media being mine.
