Look at it the other way: if the =\r\nnumber of bytes were DIFFERENT, than you&#39;d know the files HAD changed, and =\r\nyou could stop testing.  But if the number of bytes are the same, it tends =\r\nto indicate the files are likely the same, but you still need a low level f=\r\nile comparison to be sure.\n\n        My method is to compare the files using=\r\n the CMP command in unix.  There are many programs to compare files, but yo=\r\nu have to be careful not to use one that does a line-by-line compare (or a =\r\ncomparison meant for text files), since text files can be different at a lo=\r\nw level, but look essential the same in an editor (because of the way space=\r\ns and tabs and new lines work between editors and platforms).\n\n        But =\r\nanyway, the way to compare is with a program that can compare binary files,=\r\n not text files.\n\n\n        --- On Sun, 5/10/09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@ab=\r\nercrombieghostresearch.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          From: April Abercrombie &lt;apr=\r\nil@...&gt;\n          Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uplo=\r\nading rules-ATTENTION JON\n          To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n          D=\r\nate: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 2:42 PM\n\n\n\n          So if the number of bytes m=\r\natch then they are the same bytes?

For example, if I had a program in some .exe files, an=\r\nd I sent it over email, it could compress it.  But if it lost even one bit,=\r\n the resulting exe file would not execute again after it was uncompressed o=\r\nn the other side.\n\n                                This kind of compression=\r\n does things like looking for common patterns in the file, and replacing th=\r\nem with a token.  A rough example would be if it found &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot; in =\r\na file 20 times, it could replace all the occurances with say $HN1.

In video processing, this would result in a field of mul=\r\nti-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish bl=\r\nock, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise example, it maybe replac=\r\ne all the random pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.

While some formats (like wav) can store the audio very close to the way=\r\n it was recorded, formats like mp3 compress the file, and in so doing lose =\r\nsome of the sonic details.  This may not be a big deal in music, where the =\r\naudio is fairly clear to begin with.  But with sound sources with a lot of =\r\nnoise (like evps), this can not only obscure any real sounds, but pixelize =\r\nnon-sounds (like white noise) and make them start to sound like speech.\n\n  =\r\n                              So mp3 might be good for sharing the data, on=\r\nce you&#39;ve already formed an opinion based on an analysis of the wav file.  =\r\nBut mp3 is not good as a medium for analysis.  It can lead to many false po=\r\nsitives and misinterpretations.\n\n                                --- On Sun=\r\n, 5/10/09, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                   =\r\n             From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt;\n                    =\r\n            Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n                   =\r\n             To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n                                D=\r\nate: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 8:26 AM\n\n\n                                Thanks=\r\n =3D)\n\n                                 You will get the hang of it.
