You are right, the audio quality in these prefabbed boomboxes is superior.\n\nIn the AM boost clip I hear:\n\n.03  hultay\n.07  find Tim\n\nThe rest I believe is radio noise, especially Shanahan at the end.  I am not sure what the first word said in this clip is though, it may be a message of sorts.\n\n\nIn the first FM clip I hear:\n\n.03 alright\n.04 Fay\n.11 I don&#39;t tape record the one (not very clear, but this is what it sounds like to my ears)\n\n\nIn the last FM clip I hear:\n\n.01 Getting called from me -or- Getting call from Dee\n.06 Help people\n.11 Right this hand (not very clear, but this is what it sounds like to my ears)\n\nNice work as usual!\n\nTim\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Just need a switch for the AM antenna amp. FM kinda noisy. &quot;PLL&quot;==phase\n&gt; locked loop. This one has a delay when fiorst turned on, or when the band is\n&gt; changed, it has to wait for the sweep to bottom out before the sound comes\n&gt; on.\n&gt; \n&gt; F-S\n&gt;"}
