mike,
 
I'm sorry I was not around when you started, I guess no one took t=
he time to explain boxes and box research to you.
Well here is a crash cour=
se!
 
I don't know what your experience is with evp_itc or any other form o=
f spirit communication, but whatever you have learned about capturing and a=
nalyzing traditional EVP, has to be thrown right out the window. 
Box resea=
rch is a horse of a whole different color. The basic premise for traditiona=
l evp capture is that the spirit or entity that is grounded or in visitatio=
n at a set location, will manipulate the ambient energy available to it tha=
t surrounds the recording medium, be it a digital or analog recorder. It us=
es this energy, usually thought to be EMF energy to place an asimally of a =
voice onto the recorder. The recording is then uploaded to a computer and i=
s gone over by the researcher/investigator to search for these little whisp=
ered voices on the recording. This traditional way of gathering spirit comm=
unication serves it's purpose or at least has served it's purpose. 
 
When =
you decided to pick up a box, everything you ever learned about spirit comm=
unication ceased to apply.  Box communication in a nutshell, no matter what=
 type of box you use is run on the same premise. The box or radio is made t=
o sweep the dial fast enough so that no stable or whole radio signal is cap=
tured. The signal is therefore fragmented into small bits of sound and frag=
ments of human speech. The idea is for our spirit friends to be able to man=
ipulate the fragments of sound to form intelligible words, phrases and mess=
ages that we can understand clearly.
 
As you know the major factor in the =
difference between box research and traditional EVP is the fact that you ca=
n and most certainly do hear spirit communication through a box live and in=
 real time.
That's what sets this apart from any other paranormal communica=
tion research in the world or even the history of paranormal research.
 
Th=
e research you are embarking on now will take time and patience to become a=
ccustomed too but eventually with experience comes stronger communication, =
a better relationship between you and your spirit tech/guides and a better =
ear for hearing and discerning spirit communication from ordinary radio noi=
se.
 
this is just a quick explanation but don't worry anyone here that kno=
ws me can tell you there will be much more to come.
 
The reason I started =
this reply was your reference to class a EVP, in box research there is no s=
uch thing, you either hear it or you don't.
 
Mike my ears and my mouth are=
 always open so any questions, don't hesitate.

Hi B=
ruce, yeah I am new to the group. 4 weeks now.  I have other files loaded, =
and only load what is closer to class "A"  EVP.  
 
I am using the radio sh=
ack hack 12-469.
 
I record usually in the morning. I work from home, and w=
ait until the kids and wife are out of the house, so I have no interruption=
s.
 
My personal interest is to make contact with my family members and fri=
ends that have passed on. I have so many questions to ask them, etc....
 
T=
ips are welcome.. I still am playing with the sound of the radio when in sc=
an mode. Trying to get the volume just right where if i did hear a spirit, =
the sound of the radio does not drown it out.
 
Any advice you can give me =
after listening to my files, that would be great!
