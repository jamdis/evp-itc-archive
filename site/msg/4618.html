Hello Bill,

Yes, I did steal that phrase from Ursula because I thought it =
described what I was doing as compared to what I would like to be doing!

I=
 like what you said about focus on the equipment helping to establish the p=
sychic connection.  It makes so much sense.  This discussion has definitely=
 shown me that mental tools and preparation are as important as physical on=
es.  

Thank you for your input.

Robin
