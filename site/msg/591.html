<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m unable to view the images. There is a notation next to them that 
says &quot;file not stored&quot; so perhaps Yahoo&#x27;s server doens&#x27;t store them 
for long. I look forward to seeing some of your files. Thanks, Bill

&gt; Took me forever to get the webcam running right again so the video 
&gt; wasnt choppy. I still have to get all my webcam software running 
correctly 
&gt; so for now I was just using quickcam and sports video player to 
view 
&gt; frame by frame.
&gt;    
&gt;   I asked them to help me test it and I had alot of fuzzy faces 
some of 
&gt; which I saved in paintbrush (as usual) but they lost some of thier 
&gt; color intensity. Not sure why yet. I still have to hammer that bug 
out. 
&gt; They seemed eager to test as well and eventually a few clearer 
faces 
&gt; started to come thru. It will take a while for me to stop messing 
with 
&gt; settings and to get back on track but eventually I will.
&gt;    
&gt;   Enjoy.
&gt;    
&gt;   I will add them to the gallery later when I get time.
