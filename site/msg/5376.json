I think maybe some may have \nmessed with the bottom board.  You only need to access the top board \nwith the LCD display and there is nothing that will fall off except the \n2 buttoms that control the light and SW band selector, both can easily \nbe put on after the hack in a matter of seconds.  I posted some \npictures and a detailed description on my site, so you can see the \nprocedure.  It took 5 minutes the first time, but after looking at it \nagain it could probably be done faster but take your time with it.\n\nThe details are at www.keyportparanormal.com and look for the folder on \nthe left that says &quot;Simple Ghost Box Hack&quot;\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-Steve H."}
