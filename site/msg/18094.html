oon Denver time on 
                      Monday, 7/19/2010. This experimen=
t asks for participants 
                      to determine what that objec=
t is. Vague or partial answers 
                      won't be counted (for=
 example, just giving a color, shape, 
                      size, what it'=
s made of, etc): we're looking for what it 
                      is. Answe=
rs anyone reveals after noon Monday won't count. 
                      Par=
ticipants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or 
                   =
   any other means they chose. At the end of the experiment, 
             =
         I will reveal the object, and a tally of the number of 
          =
            correct and/or incorrect answers.

In order to keep 
          =
            me honest, I have taken a picture of the object at the 
       =
               start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section 
=
                      (RJ folder) of this group. The idea with this file is=
 that 
                      you can download it now and 'keep it safe' on =
your 
                      computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I =
will post 
                      the password so you can reveal the content=
s of the file. 
                      That way, you were in control of the =
original image during 
                      the entire test, not me. If yo=
u can follow the link, it is 
                      here:

16/2010 I placed an

until noon Denver time on 
                      Monday, 7/19/2010. This ex=
periment asks for participants 
                      to determine what tha=
t object is. Vague or partial answers 
                      won't be count=

                  =
    Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or

          any other means they chose. At the end of the experiment, 
      =
                I will reveal the object, and a tally of the number of

                   correct and/or incorrect answers.<br><br>In order to kee=

 the 
                      start of the experiment and loaded it to the Fi=
les section 
                      (RJ folder) of this group. The idea with=
 this file is that 
                      you can download it now and 'keep=
 it safe' on your 
                      computer. Then at the end of the e=
xperiment, I will post 
                      the password so you can revea=

                      That way, you were in co=
