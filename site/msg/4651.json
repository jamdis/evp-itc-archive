So I didn&#39;t \n&gt; have the good fortune of meeting Frank S. as I wasn&#39;t at the November \n&gt; Stanley event. :(\n&gt; \n&gt; My first exposure to the Spirit Box at The Stanley caused me to \n&gt; wonder why Chris and Chip had to interpret 90 percent of everything \n&gt; that was coming through; so in other words, it wasn&#39;t very clear \n&gt; what, if anything, was being communicated.  It certainly gave us much \n&gt; fodder to chew on though!\n&gt; \n&gt; I tend to view the ITC ghost/spirit boxes as akin to a kind of \n&gt; electronic Ouija board -- instead of a planchette-pointer on a board \n&gt; with letters in the alphabet to spell out answers, we&#39;re supplying \n&gt; the spirits with radio frequencies and sound bites to rearrange and \n&gt; form into audible words.  With this in mind, one must be cautious in \n&gt; conducting experiments in one&#39;s home because one never knows what one \n&gt; is inviting into one&#39;s home.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Regardless, I&#39;m glad that we&#39;re all trying, learning, and sharing.  \n&gt; Like the early medieval alchemists, many who have risked their own \n&gt; lives (or unintentionally grew hair on the soles of their feet) by \n&gt; ingesting some of their own concoctions, we&#39;re part of a pioneering \n&gt; group of spirit chasers that began back in the 19th century.  Because \n&gt; of lack of funding from the government in this field, I frankly don&#39;t \n&gt; know if we&#39;ll be able to obtain scientifically-validated proof of our \n&gt; ITC experiments in our own lifetime, but I like to think that 500 \n&gt; years down the road, the people in the future will look back at what \n&gt; we&#39;re doing today as pioneers, maybe not as charming as the early \n&gt; alchemists are portrayed in Durer woodcuts, but pioneers nonetheless.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sharon\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hey Sharon and Ann,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Did you meet Frank S while you were at the Stanley event in \n&gt; November?\n&gt; &gt; He was in the lobby in the evenings showing and discussing his new\n&gt; &gt; Box.

I met him about 3 \n&gt; years\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ago.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My husband is a commercial photographer and Mark asked him to \n&gt; do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; portrait for a book he was coming out with. He came to our \n&gt; home\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; studio\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the portrait, and I got to talk with him a little about \n&gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does. At that time all I knew of EVP was from the White Noise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; movie,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t sure it was real. But Mark was very nice, passionate \n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ITC/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EVP and very convincing. I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to expect \n&gt; when I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; originally heard what he did, with all the loonies out there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claiming\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all kinds of stuff, but I got a really good feeling from him \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very, well, like I said, convincing. After that I went to his \n&gt; web\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; site\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and also bought one of his books, which was a nice read.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I went to the Stanley Hotel in November with a ghost hunting \n&gt; group\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mark was a speaker there. I was really looking forward to his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lecture,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but ended up with a wicked stomach virus and had to come home\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; early.

I forgot to answer: No, I have not given up ghost \n&gt; hunting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all, but over the years I have come to focus more on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; collection\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and distribution of experiences than on encountering \n&gt; phenomena\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself. ITC has really affirmed this for me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve felt all along that my job is to make people aware that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual phenomena go on all the time in millions of \n&gt; lives; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a scientist and I know nothing I do will change the way \n&gt; science\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinks. BUT if I can open the minds of young people today,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our future scientists will make it their business to figure \n&gt; all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know this is a lot of what ITC experimenters are doing:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; convincing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others of the afterlife by their recorded evidence. Amazing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can happen when THAT happens.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, Mark Macy is so wonderful because he has dedicated \n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to this. He and his colleagues have received such detailed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descriptions of how the afterlife works, that they have \n&gt; helped\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; living change their lives to erase the fear of death--and \n&gt; to live\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a way that brings us to as high a spiritual level as \n&gt; possible\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away when our bodies die. This means, for example, dealing \n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issues and addictions, that plague us in life, since the \n&gt; spirits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tell us we take it all with us! That is, death isn&#39;t a cure-\n&gt; all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any glimpse at the history of ITC shows us that all of this \n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gradually growing since the 19th century, when state-of-the-\n&gt; art\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; graphite pencils and telegraphs were used to contact the \n&gt; dead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since then, there have been &quot;breakthroughs&quot; a number of \n&gt; times\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; astounding floods of messages have come through.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You experimenters are all so incredible--I&#39;m amazed every \n&gt; day at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your love, dedication and faith. Surely something wonderful \n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to come from all this, and I think it&#39;s going to come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; during\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our lifetimes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ursula\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robin Searcy Henson &lt;MudPuddleFarm@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Bill,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I did steal that phrase from Ursula because I thought \n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; described what I was doing as compared to what I would like \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like what you said about focus on the equipment helping to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; establish the psychic connection.
