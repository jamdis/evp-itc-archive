"Have none of you never wondered why some files here are amazingly clear while others are far closer to what actually happens with any of the devices? Has no one else questioned this, even to yourself?"

No, I do not question them or their reality. No one is born spiritually equal! We all have different levels of experience, psi abilities and connections. For me to say that everyone should get the same connection as me would be unfair and naive. I would expect that there are many people who get better and worse. I am grateful that I can get a connection at all. This unfounded jealousy is exactly what brought down INIT.


Do you accept everything you see and hear from everyone at face value?

Yes, I do! Who am I to question yours or anyone else's reality? What you believe is true, is true in your world.


Do you never have ideas on how things might be improved? Do you never question? 

Sure, I have several experimental pieces of equipment that have given me different degrees of success in the clarity of communication. The equipment is only a small part though. Your attitude and intentions are what will strengthen or weaken your transdimensional bonds. If you are having a bad day or harbor feelings of resentment, jealousy or hate your chances of connecting with something higher than the earth plane are slim. Not many beings want to come down to this dark level unless they are already here. Usually, these beings are identified by their pleas for help or a streak of nastiness. The higher beings that are around them are usually gatekeepers and "social workers" as I call them. The social workers are the ones trying to help the earthbound spirits to move up and out of the darkness. Gatekeepers facilitate your communication channels.

Anyways, you get the gist.... Bottom line is, if experimenters want to improve transcommunication then they have to work on themselves and not their equipment.

PS: See there is no reason to use nastiness to respond to questions. Being confident in what you know allows for a calm response.

Regards,

Frank R.

            I never said Frank was misguided or selfish but, I'm not surprised you

construed it that way.

Research and researchers in the truest form of the word is and are

open to critique and suggestions. So, no, in the truest meaning I

don't believe so. My comments were absolutely valid and could have

been used in a productive manner but, instead I was deflected and

called names. 

For myself, I believe it is of utmost importance to have an accurate

view of what is really happening. Edited files may indeed be very

accurate but there is no way to tell when the raw is not available and

it causes me great concern that the suggestion was met with such

hostility. If it doesn't cause each of you concern as well, then I

worry about your ability to be objective as well. Have none of you

never wondered why some files here are amazingly clear while others

are far closer to what actually happens with any of the devices? Has

no one else questioned this, even to yourself? I get approximately 2

-3 emails a week from people wondering that. 

You can not become offended and take questions like mine personally. I

was never attacking. I asked for opinions and thoughts about my

questions. 

Do you accept everything you see and hear from everyone at face value?

Do you never have ideas on how things might be improved? Do you never

question? I'm guessing the answer to all three is a "no". 

I never said anyone was faking anything here. If you thought that than

I wonder why you thought that. Personally, I believe that

communication is happening. It is the how and the why and the ways it

can be possibly improved that concern me. It is in knowing what is

being recorded accurately, before it is cut and spliced and amped

otherwise it is not a true representation of what is happening. We

almost completely eliminate the truth in peer review when we only

provide them with an end result not how we got there. 

There is nothing negative in what I posted, only in the reaction. I

have seen Bruce come under fire before but it's these comments and

opinions and suggestions of mine that cause him so much negativity he

wants to leave? 

So, in the end I have a clearer idea. The group is concerned solely

with recording and developing devices to do so. That's fine. Recording

the communications is a good thing. But my opinions thoughts, etc are

not welcome here or desired. That's fine too. 

I wish you all the best in your en devours. Sincerely.



Babs

No one is born spiritually equal! We all have different levels of experience, psi abilities and connections. For me to say that everyone should get the same connection as me would be unfair and naive. I would expect that there are
 many people who get better and worse. I am grateful that I can get a connection at all. This unfounded jealousy is exactly what brought down INIT.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
Do you accept everything you see and hear from everyone at face value?<br><br></span>Yes, I do! Who am I to question yours or anyone else's reality? What you believe is true, is true in your world.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
Do you never have ideas on how things might be improved? Do you never question? <br><br></span>Sure, I have several experimental pieces of equipment that have given me different degrees of success in the clarity of communication. The equipment is only a small part though. Your attitude and intentions are what will strengthen or weaken your transdimensional bonds. If you are having a bad day or harbor feelings of resentment, jealousy or hate your chances of connecting with something higher than the earth plane are slim. Not many beings want to come down to this dark level unless they are already here. Usually, these beings are identified by their pleas for help or a streak of nastiness. The higher beings that are around them are usually gatekeepers and "social workers" as I call them. The social workers are the ones trying to help the earthbound spirits to move up and out of the darkness. Gatekeepers facilitate your communication channels.<br><br>Anyways,
 you get the gist.... Bottom line is, if experimenters want to improve transcommunication then they have to work on themselves and not their equipment.<br><br>PS: See there is no reason to use nastiness to respond to questions. Being confident in what you know allows for a calm response.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Frank R.<br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><br><br></span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span><br><div style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; padding-left: 5px; font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;">----- Original Message ----<br>From: babiarz3 <babiarz3@...><br>To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com<br>Sent: Monday, January 21, 2008 6:45:02 PM<br>Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Babs has Issues!<br><br>








    <div id="ygrp-text">
            <p>I never said Frank was misguided or selfish but, I'm not surprised you<br>
construed it that way.<br>
Research and researchers in the truest form of the word is and are<br>
open to critique and suggestions. So, no, in the truest meaning I<br>
don't believe so. My comments were absolutely valid and could have<br>
been used in a productive manner but, instead I was deflected and<br>
called names. <br>
For myself, I believe it is of utmost importance to have an accurate<br>
view of what is really happening. Edited files may indeed be very<br>
accurate but there is no way to tell when the raw is not available and<br>
it causes me great concern that the suggestion was met with such<br>
hostility. If it doesn't cause each of you concern as well, then I<br>
worry about your ability to be objective as well. Have none of you<br>
never wondered why some files here are amazingly clear while others<br>
are far closer to what actually happens with any of the devices? Has<br>
no one else questioned this, even to yourself? I get approximately 2<br>
-3 emails a week from people wondering that. <br>
You can not become offended and take questions like mine personally. I<br>
was never attacking. I asked for opinions and thoughts about my<br>
questions. <br>
Do you accept everything you see and hear from everyone at face value?<br>
Do you never have ideas on how things might be improved? Do you never<br>
question? I'm guessing the answer to all three is a "no". <br>
I never said anyone was faking anything here. If you thought that than<br>
I wonder why you thought that. Personally, I believe that<br>
communication is happening. It is the how and the why and the ways it<br>
can be possibly improved that concern me. It is in knowing what is<br>
being recorded accurately, before it is cut and spliced and amped<br>
otherwise it is not a true representation of what is happening. We<br>
almost completely eliminate the truth in peer review when we only<br>
provide them with an end result not how we got there. <br>
There is nothing negative in what I posted, only in the reaction. I<br>
have seen Bruce come under fire before but it's these comments and<br>
opinions and suggestions of mine that cause him so much negativity he<br>
wants to leave? <br>
So, in the end I have a clearer idea. The group is concerned solely<br>
with recording and developing devices to do so. That's fine. Recording<br>
the communications is a good thing. But my opinions thoughts, etc are<br>
not welcome here or desired. That's fine too. <br>
I wish you all the best in your en devours. Sincerely.<br>
<br>
Babs<br>
