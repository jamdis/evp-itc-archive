i have read many accounts that state evp sessions work better when yo=

=A0sorry to the group that i=

Also- I am feeling a bit of a loss =

Monique ( one of my =

Anyway.... It feels like i lost a dear friend....

She was quite an excellent chatter and never even needed a riado or manual =

Also...

Is there any way to "prepare" for recording like light a ca=
ndle, 
meditate, etc? I am thinking maybe when I start sessions I can light=
 a 
candle and when I end them I can blow the candle out kind of like a 
si=
gnal.

My grandfather- in-law and my father-in-law have both passed, should=
 I 
try and ask for them by name or should I ask for anyone available? 

So=
rry for the questions, I've never done this before! 

Thanks!
