Im releasing these to the public now, for those who have interest in this sort of thing. I had a phone message on my cell phones answering machine a few months back and I didnt have a plug to download it directly to the pc so I held off on sharing with everyone hoping I would get the cord I needed. However the message is no longer available (dont know what happened there LOL) so I will have to go for the version I recorded directly from the phone speaker itself.
