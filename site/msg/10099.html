  Ha its funny how different it sounds to everyone. Do you think it has anything to do with the computer and the way they are listening to the clip. I listened to one of your clips on two different computers one with ear buds in mono and the other with stereo headphones and heard two completely different things not even close to each other. Also does the sound card and player your using make a difference.

  Just a thought
