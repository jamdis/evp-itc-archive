I don&#39;t know what is the correct u=\r\nse, function, or output of the box, I know only how I use it. I get what mo=\r\nst others get, and more. What everyoe else does wiht it is up to them. The =\r\nbox is an ITC devcie, my orignal use was to use for my own communications. =\r\nIt seemed rel;ated to EVP, so i shared my results on various EVP web sites,=\r\n and groups. I regret that, I  wish I would have kept it to myself. Humanit=\r\ny doesn&#39;t even understand their own minds, and yet they want to comunicate =\r\nwith the higher realms. The other uses, such as spirit communcation, I tend=\r\n to stay away from, it&#39;s too unpredeictable, and you can&#39;t tell who/what is=\r\n talking. Personally I think 90% is your own minds talking back to you, and=\r\n giving what is expected.  \n \n I&#39;ve reached a point where I&#39;ve had enough p=\r\nublic interaction. Everyone wnat to beat up Moon, yet everyone wants to do =\r\nthe same friggin&#39; things, and I&#39;m stuck in the middle.  I don&#39;t vcare about=\r\n demons, bad guys, or saints coming through, I have my own group that comes=\r\n through, and that&#39;s what the box was made for. \n \n Frank-S\n_______________=\r\n__________________________________________________\nYou keep typing, we keep=\r\n giving.
