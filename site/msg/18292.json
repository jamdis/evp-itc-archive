From read these emails it seems all this is, is a lot of he/she said crap. The matter remains (regardless of beliefs) these boxes hold no concrete proof of paranormal. Just because one or two things happen doesnt make it indefinetly perfect. I mean i have faith in them but science teaches us to go over things with a fine tooth comb and you cant with these. That is the point, regardless of beliefs minimal evidence.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Have an idea, we will go to bat for you and Frank, Steve, don&#39;t be afraid, at least talk to an attorney, they won&#39;t charge you a thing at least for a first consultation, let them know, you and Frank have witnesses, this will damage your reps. Curtis is right this could hang on the net for many years what they said, I have sites from years ago, for my paralegal business from 10 years ago, i have no idea how to even take the thing down anymore, I would go for it, Steve, don&#39;t even talk to them, the lawyer will tell you not to have any conversation with those people, otherwise it could jeopardize when you go to court. sf\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Urkel23 urkel23@...\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Mon, Jul 26, 2010 2:19 pm\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Science vs. Ghost Box Technology\n&gt; \n&gt;           Â                                   Also, if you listen to that podcast you will hear some very specific protocols that these science minded folks display.  Like giggling like school girls while attacking a person that neither of them know.  And, my favorite in the show:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Dr Rorke calling me a douce bag at around 20 minutes in.
