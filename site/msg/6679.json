They told me tonight to put the  old antenna \nback on and the sessions keep getting better and better.  I  dragged Juli and \nJoel in on what i believed and felt was going to be a great box  session and \nhere is a file only a couple minutes in to our hour long  session.  This is a bit \nrough sounding, but hearing it live is pretty clear  and you can hear me \nrespond and than Joel agrees that he heard it too.  My  sessions are pretty \nincredible since the random mode started working on the  FB#27 and i feel the random \nis the best thing out there...hands down.  I  have done Sessions on the \ninternet through Skype all week and i feel the energy  between Juli and I are \nreally bringing them through clearly.  I only use  FB#27 now in random mode and it \nis the best feature on any box, between the  white noise, echo and random \nthere is no competetion up to this point.  The  hacks are good, but nothing is \nbetter than an original frank&#39;s box.  Our  friends on the other side told me that \nthey fixed the random mode to go and  teach others and i am going to a \nmeeting on wednesday to demonstrate the  different boxes and our friend made a \npromise to come though if i go....so we  will see.\n \nHere is one of the files i got so far.\n \n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n**************Biggest Grammy Award surprises of all time on AOL Music.     \n(http://music.aol.com/grammys/pictures/never-won-a-grammy?NCID=aolcmp003000000025\n48)\n\r\n-------------------------------1202008265\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUS-ASCII&quot;&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16587&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY id=\r\n=3Drole_body style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot; =\r\n\nbottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Dr=\r\nole_document \nface=3DArial color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;I have been having weird sessions with Frank&#39;s Box #27, but in a good \nway=\r\n.&nbsp; They told me to change the antenna, which it did and the random \nst=\r\narted working and never has on this box.&nbsp; They told me tonight to put =\r\nthe \nold antenna back on and the sessions keep getting better and better.&n=\r\nbsp; I \ndragged Juli and Joel in on what i believed and felt was going to b=\r\ne a great box \nsession and here is a file only a couple minutes in to our h=\r\nour long \nsession.&nbsp; This is a bit rough sounding, but hearing it live =\r\nis pretty clear \nand you can hear me respond and than Joel agrees that he h=\r\neard it too.&nbsp; My \nsessions are pretty incredible since the random mode=\r\n started working on the \nFB#27 and i feel the random is the best thing out =\r\nthere...hands down.&nbsp; I \nhave done Sessions on the internet through Sky=\r\npe all week and i feel the energy \nbetween Juli and I are really bringing t=\r\nhem through clearly.&nbsp; I only use \nFB#27 now in random mode and it is t=\r\nhe best feature on any box, between the \nwhite noise, echo and random there=\r\n is no competetion up to this point.&nbsp; The \nhacks are good, but nothing=\r\n is better than an original frank&#39;s box.&nbsp; Our \nfriends on the other si=\r\nde told me that they fixed the random mode to go and \nteach others and i am=\r\n going to a meeting on wednesday to demonstrate the \ndifferent boxes and ou=\r\nr friend made a promise to come though if i go....so we \nwill see.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Here is one of the files i got so far.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Steve H.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;color: =\r\nblack; font: normal 10pt ARIAL, SAN-SERIF;&quot;&gt;&lt;HR style=3D&quot;MARGIN-TOP: 10px&quot;&gt;=\r\nWho&#39;s never won?  &lt;A title=3D&quot;http://music.aol.com/grammys/pictures/never-w=\r\non-a-grammy?NCID=3Daolcmp00300000002548&quot; href=3D&quot;http://music.aol.com/gramm=\r\nys/pictures/never-won-a-grammy?NCID=3Daolcmp00300000002548&quot; target=3D&quot;_blan=\r\nk&quot;&gt;Biggest Grammy Award surprises of all time on AOL Music.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n-------------------------------1202008265--\r\n\n\r\n--part1_d3e.220d02d4.34d68acb_boundary\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;\n\tname=&quot;i_got_a_question_for_steve----forced_to_believe.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=&quot;i_got_a_question_for_steve----forced_to_believe.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--part1_d3e.220d02d4.34d68acb_boundary--"}
