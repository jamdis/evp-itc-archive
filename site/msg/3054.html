&gt; I am truely sorry for your situation,  Bruce,  and hope you the

&gt; in deaths,  but  with sanity, also.  I,  for instance, am on a  
&gt; steady diet of three psychological medications,  have been for the  
&gt; two years since.  I am not alone in this,  not by a long shot.    
&gt; And my doctors do not give me much hope of improvement. God

&gt; I sure put sparks in your day,  didn&#x27;t I?  And you still missed my  
&gt; point entirely.  BTW, I&#x27;m a New Orleans Katrina survivor.  We  
&gt; didn&#x27;t get rescued for 4 days.  God bless.          --Rod

&gt;  One last word, that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like Paranormal Invetigators,  
&gt; and ghost hunts. These people have no clue about spirit, and about  
&gt; real spirit communcation, they have a paradigm they live by, and  
&gt; that&#x27;s that all ghosts are like the Hollywood version, and nothing  
&gt; else exists. They ignore all contrary evidence, yet make enough  
&gt; noise that the lay public believes them to be the true experts.  
&gt; Nuff said!

&gt;
&gt; You have been a member of this group since 2004 and still have no
&gt; idea what it&#x27;s about ? As far as me not watching ghost shows on tv,
&gt; it seems by your explanation of how you have been involved in the PI
&gt; field that you are a lot like those cheesy ghost hunting shows. To
&gt; make a statement that spirits are not interactive and could care less
&gt; about us or what we are trying to do, that alone shows you know
&gt; nothing. I am a disabled rescue worker injured in the 911 attacks and
&gt; am home all day with plenty of time for research and I can
&gt; imphatically tell you that they do pay attention they do interact
&gt; they are definitely interested and they are working harder than we
&gt; are to communicate.
&gt;
&gt; maybe you have formed your opinion because in your vast wealth of
&gt; knowledge and experience you have never come across a spirit that was
&gt; interested in you. besides throwing you all around a room or lifting
&gt; you into the air and hurling you like a shot put or whatever you
&gt; claim some ghosts did. And if they did do that to you that sounds
&gt; pretty interactive to me. I can see why they would want to throw you
&gt; around and kick and bite you but if I where you I would find another
&gt; hobby.
&gt; and I say hobby because by your analogy of it that&#x27;s all it is to you.
&gt;
&gt; As far as your friend with the mini box, yeah I&#x27;m not stupid I
&gt; figured that out, you can stop trying to defend it no one here is
&gt; gonna buy that piece of crap.
&gt;
&gt; I will not trade any more malicious posts with you so don&#x27;t bother.
