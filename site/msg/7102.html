<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank,

I plan on building one myself one of these days but it&#x27;s not my 
top-priority project and I&#x27;m happy just to sit here and read what everyone 
else is doing with the boxes.  My main construction activities have been 
with ham radio millimeter-wave equipment.  You cannot imagine (well, 
maybe you can) what&#x27;s involved in building stuff for frequencies above 47 
GHz.
:-)

All the recordings are fascinating and I don&#x27;t post very often but I do 
listen to them!

&gt; Hi All;
&gt; I&#x27;m wondering why some many that do this &quot;reseach&quot; go mash potatoes in the head, developing what seems to be that messiah complex. Box user after box user seems to go down this road. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just human ego, or they get possessed, or what. Maybe it&#x27;s blinded by dollar signs!? Maybe it&#x27;s like the Brookings Report, people just can not handle the truth on a psychological/ego level. I think that report applies to all encounters with  the vastness of the universe.
&gt;
&gt; I can&#x27;t provide boxes for anyone else until I figure this stuff out. It&#x27;s not ethical to give people something that has the potential of fucking them up, to be blunt. I wanted to give these boxes out to see how it worked for others, to see if they got something like I did, and so far it&#x27;s very disappointing. It&#x27;s almost like an experiment on people, except most were pretty much begging for, and demanding the things. Even if it&#x27;s not the boxes per se`, that&#x27;s even more reason to avoid the situation.
