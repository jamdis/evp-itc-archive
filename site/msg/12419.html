<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>In my eyes we are all Ghost Boxologists, and all equal.
That is why I coined the phrases:

Ghost Box-ology (Ghost Boxology) - The study of Ghost Boxes including 
the art/science of design, test, instruction, and performance.

Ghost Box-ologist (Ghost Boxologist) - One who practices the 
art/science of Ghost Boxology.

There is no right way, or wrong way... there are just ways.
Who knows what the spirits or entities like best?  I&#x27;m sure there are 
a number of methods that work well for them, and us.. and we are 
always attempting new ways. Some work and some don&#x27;t... or not at 
first maybe.

Frank&#x27;s Box, the Radio Shack Hack(s), the Mini Box, Joe&#x27;s Box, etc. 
are all methods that use sweeping audio.  And others are coming up 
with new ideas all the time.
The Ovilus and Puck for example.  Even though Bill Chappell says 
those methods are just for entertainment, I&#x27;m sure there will be 
times when things happen when using those devices that make one 
wonder.
(Note: I don&#x27;t have a Frank&#x27;s Box, Mini Box, or Joe&#x27;s Box, but I hear 
they all work well.)

It&#x27;s really great to have people (Ghost Boxologists) that are willing 
to share their information and ideas.  Recently I&#x27;ve read some posts 
about another method using a chamber, switch, etc. for an audio type 
device.  That&#x27;s awesome that there is still a desire to try new stuff.

I too am working on something new, right now in the test phase, and 
I&#x27;ll be sharing that in the near (or far) future.
I&#x27;m also going to attempt to &#x27;crack&#x27; that other radio again, even 
though it might not be possible.

Thanks to all who keep this Ghost Boxology effort going!

&gt;  &#x27;The grays&#x27; never said they can only speak to &#x27;certified&#x27; box 
users. I find all that ego BS highly offensive, it&#x27;s just so a few 
can keep charging mega bucks for readings, instead of having anyone 
go to Radio Shack and buy a cheap &quot;box&quot;. I don&#x27;t fault anyione for 
making a living, as long as it&#x27;s honest. There&#x27;s a few out there 
claiming to be Box masters, and all I can ask is where do they get 
that shit!? Everyone hears different, and the damn messages change 
for the listener, so how can anyone be an expert, or more qualified 
than anyone else. I&#x27;ve always said one has to be very careful when 
you think you&#x27;re getting the absolute truth, or &quot;know what questions 
to ask&quot;. I make the boxes, and I don&#x27;t have anyone, or anything 
telling me it has to be this, that, or the other thing. They never 
say it has to be random, or only linear will work. I get pitifully 
little technical advice.
&gt;  
&gt;  Besides, the friggin&#x27; box is one method of many that supplies a 
raw audio that spiritis and entities use to form voices. The box is 
consistent, but I often get better, and clearer messages and voices 
with other methods, such as DRV, the foreign language method and 
EVPmaker.
