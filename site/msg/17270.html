<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Starts out &quot;next month the 17th&quot; Don&#x27;t know what that is, but I&#x27;ve heard it
several times in various recordings. But wait, this is AM, where&#x27;s the usual
interference? At 5 seconds &quot;Wait---Navy&quot;, maybe that has to do with the old
disaster.

 Oh crap! I forgot to ask for the scientfic aproval before posting.
Admittedly, I was being mean spirited on purpose, I&#x27;m not going to allow
some science dork to brow beat me into submission. I believe the home page
of EVP-ITC says something to the effect that we don&#x27;t follow science, this
is for sharing information, and using the cut and try method, see what
works. I know everyone hears different, and that&#x27;s ok, that does not
invalidate this stuff. My apologies for ruffling feathers.
