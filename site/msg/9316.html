<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m already so pleased with the research results I obtain that
anything better from box 31 will be extra whipped cream and cherries
on top of my enormous vat of ice cream. 

I am curious to see how the mini and Frank&#x27;s compare. I feel that the
my minibox is a bit like a TARDIS in a way--I hate to say it has
bonded with me or imprinted on me (or I&#x27;ve imprinted on it), but that
does seem to describe it. The entities operating through it have bent
their communication style to my circumstances. I will be curious to
see if 31 does something similar. Who knows? It may decide it likes my
son Nick over me, or my friend Julie.

Whatever happens, I shall enjoy the experience!

Ann

 I can only tell you that I love my Franks Box for there is nothing
like it in the world!

&gt;           Well, we&#x27;ll see if number 31 can hold a candle to mini
114. ;) Frank says that 31 is about the size of a mini, and that&#x27;s
good, because I haven&#x27;t got a lot of space to experiment in.  
&gt; 
&gt;   We&#x27;re all quite excited here--my son, Julie Stoddard, and I. And
of course, I am really happy that Frank has vetted and approved me to
adopt one of his babies. (I think the Purples made him do it; they&#x27;ve
always been sweet on me, right from the start. ;) )
&gt;   
&gt; 
&gt;   Thanks for always cheering me on, Bruce. You&#x27;re the toppermost.
