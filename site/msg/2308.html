  Hey Guys
      Here is the info taken straight off of the company's website.  I have to say that it is a very affordable meter and very rugged.  I am by no means a professional in this field, but I have to say that it is by far one of the most useful pieces I carry.  The company is K II (2) enterprises, I got mine off of ebay and had it in about 3 weeks do to back log in production.  I hope this helps.

                                              Protect your family from harmful EMFs!   Measure the EMF (Electro magnetic Field) strength of every electrical device in your home, workplace or school; outdoor power lines, underground lines and even when you travel and shop for appliances. Health concerns about the negative effects of ELECTRO MAGNETIC FIELDS (EMF) from appliances, power lines, and home wiring have caused the U.S. Government to issue a warning to use "Prudent Avoidance" to help reduce your exposure to this risk.   Since EMF's are everywhere it may be impossible to totally avoid them.  The SAFE RANGE EMF METER from K-II can help you measure these potentially harmful fields and determine the safe range to help reduce exposure. It also helps you determine which appliances produce high level emissions.

                FEATURES INCLUDE:                        Easy to read LED Display          50 & 60 Hz operation          Five level milliGauss ranges          For indoor and outdoor use           Durable plastic case                    Operates for months on a single 9V battery            Detects the ELF range (50 to 1,000Hz) & VLF range (1,000 to 20,000Hz)

  Good morning all,
       
          Chris Fleming used one on the episode about the Manson murders before.  I have had one for a while now, and let me be the first to say that it works.  I have had numerous two way conversations using it, as well as captured video evidence of these conversations showing that there is nothing around capable of giving off an EMF.  The only issue that I have concern with is unlike EVP work or video ITC work you have no recognizable voice or image to positively correlate who the communication is coming from.  In my case, I might ask the question "Are you Sylvia, my mother, show me two spikes for yes and one spike for no" and the meter will spike twice for yes, but I have no voice or image I would recognize to verify that is who is causing the meter to spike.  The meter is a very useful tool and I do not conduct an investigation or session without it by my side, but like the rest of the tools in this field it has its valuable points as well as negative points.

I saw on Ghost Hunters last night that they were using a "K2 Meter" to get yes-no answers from the unseen. I never heard of that meter before.
