<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I had an AM mode voice using amnual sweep that I haven&#x27;t had time ot 
copy to the computer yet, that said somehthing like &quot;use a diode to get 
your Lincoln&quot;. Back in 2002, I did have Lincoln attempt to speak 
through the box. It was hard to hear, and you could tell he didn&#x27;t know 
what a mic was. I think I&#x27;ve missed alot by having to focus all my 
attention, and time on building boards, and almost none by comparison 
on sessions.
