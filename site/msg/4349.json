I have not uploaded the file, yet, but I am ruined.  Great \nquestioning and answering...very discernable.  It seems when the \nperson operating the device tunes in, the mish mash of audio bits \nbecome something else when the spirits start using it.\n\nAs Halliday said, no box needed with these radios.  The box made it \ndifficult to record clearer voices and made things a bit muffled for \nme.  I made an echo chamber and used a sound chamber, but didn&#39;t like \nit as well.  The amplified speakers seem to give a nice &quot;hiss&quot; which \nfills in the gaps with white noise (?), but that hiss makes it \ndifficult for clarity when dropped in a chamber. \n\nNow I am excited to use the 12-470 (older version) without the \nchambers and with (just to compare, as well).\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@...m, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ahhh... Welcome to the world of 12-470 (older version) ownership.  \nI \n&gt; think you will find it a bit better than the 12-469, in my opinion \n&gt; anyway.  I guess since I own both models... I can say that after a \n&gt; side by side comparison.  You can say goodbye to that AM sweep \n&gt; clicking found on the 12-469, anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; Enjoy your new experimental device... once it arrives!\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mike,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you.
