I hope t=\r\no get a new experiment up and \n            running soon. Since there wasn&#39;t=\r\n much participation Mon-Wed, I think \n            the next experiment will =\r\nbe arranged to mostly span the \n            weekends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, thanks =\r\nto everyone who participated in this \n            first experiment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div style=3D&quot;height: 0px; color: rgb(255, 255, 255)=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;font =\r\nid=3D&quot;role_document&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;font styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;background-color: transparent;&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;height: 0px; color: rgb(255, 255, 255)=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font id=3D&quot;role_document&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=3D&quot;background-color: transparent;&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font id=3D&quot;role_do=\r\ncument&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  =\r\n   \n\n\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-811197308-1279143966=:17432--"}
