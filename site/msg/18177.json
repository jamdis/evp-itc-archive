This experiment as=\r\nked for participants to determine what that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ob=\r\nject was. Vague or partial answers would not be counted (for example, just&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; giving a color, shape, size, what it&#39;s made of=\r\n, etc): we&#39;re looking for what&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it is. Answers =\r\nanyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#39;t count.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any o=\r\nther means&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they chose.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In order to keep me honest, I took a pic=\r\nture of the object at the start of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the experim=\r\nent and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The idea with this file is that you could download it a=\r\nt the beginning of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the experiment and &#39;keep it=\r\n safe&#39; on your computer. Then at the end of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; experiment, I would post the password so you can reveal the contents of t=\r\nhe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; file. That way, you were in control of the =\r\noriginal image during the entire&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time, not me.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Passworded pdf:&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.pdf&quot;&gt;http://=\r\ntech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The password for that file i=\r\ns: 2plus2isFour&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instructions, if you need them=\r\n for the other files, are also in that RJ&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fold=\r\ner.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So to the res=\r\nults:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Number of p=\r\narticipants: 6&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Total tries: 29&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; Ambiguous answers: 0&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Correct ans=\r\nwers: 0&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Object: C=\r\nhair&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Object picture:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://tech.groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.jpg&quot;&gt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a little side experiment, on Monday I also asked i=\r\nf anyone had gotten&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any answers that might ind=\r\nicate an article of clothing (though I did not say&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; why I was asking). One theory is that the human operator can be influe=\r\nnced&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by things they already know or suspect, a=\r\nnd so interpret audio with their&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; own personal =\r\n&#39;educated guesses&#39;, that would differ from what they would hear&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; had they not known those things. This side experiment did=\r\n indicate some&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; support for that theory, since =\r\nbefore I mentioned &#39;articles of clothing&#39;, no&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\none included an article of clothing in their results. But after I mentioned=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it, several reports of clothing began to appe=\r\nar. I did not add these tries&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the results a=\r\nbove.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone h=\r\nas any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let me&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know.
