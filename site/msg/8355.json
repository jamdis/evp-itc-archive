I record direct to the \ncomputer with a Soundblaser Audigy card set to +3 octave to bring the \npitch back, this is why it sounds a bit &#39;off&#39;. The &quot;Ohhh Yes&quot; clip is \njust how it was recorded, I find it most unusual. I&#39;ll try more \ntesting tonight, it&#39;s been exciting.\n\nDave\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Dave,\n&gt; \n&gt; the &quot;Ohhhh yes&quot; file is of course absolutely clear. Did you slow it\n&gt; down? It sounds so &quot;stretched&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; From &quot;You hear the people&quot;, I can&#39;t hear the &quot;peo&quot; from &quot;people&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; And from &quot;The [peo]ple u[se the] test, you should [tape]..error&quot;, I\n&gt; can&#39;t hear the parts between brackets.\n&gt; \n&gt; But that doesn&#39;t mean anything, since we all have a different \nhearing,\n&gt; and EVP are primarily for the person who gets them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Stefan,\n&gt; &gt;  I tried your idea last night using your file and instructions \nand got some results. Most messages were two or maybe three words, \nonly a couple were longer with any meaning. I&#39;ll post a few here as\n&gt; &gt; an example.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ohh Yes&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You hear the people&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The people use the test, you should tape..error&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the excellent tip, this method appears to have great \npotential,\n&gt; &gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- yahoogroups@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: Misty Dawn &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] An idea: random event generator based on \nalphabet\n&gt; &gt; Date: Wed, 26 Mar 2008 02:39:52 +0100\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Misty, &quot;inner energy&quot;, all,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; maybe one could feed the SpeakJet allophones into EVPmaker. The \nattached\n&gt; &gt; WAV file contains the 72 allophones of the SpeakJet chip. (I used\n&gt; &gt; Audition to cut them out of the sample clip which has been posted \nhere\n&gt; &gt; recently, and store them in a cue list.) To use this file as an \nEVPmaker\n&gt; &gt; source, the &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option must be checked. I have done a \nfew short\n&gt; &gt; sessions, and got this strange message:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;                 &quot;I little Sir help you eclipse.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Doesn&#39;t make any sense to me... lol)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of course, this cannot replace a hardware version of SpeakJet, \nsince\n&gt; &gt; EVPmaker isn&#39;t able to produce the proper transitions between the\n&gt; &gt; allophones. But maybe it&#39;s worth a try...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Stefan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n----__Part.20080326163611.E86746CE\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;032608theeightiethyearihearpeopleallovertheearth.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;032608theeightiethyearihearpeopleallovertheearth.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__Part.20080326163611.E86746CE--"}
