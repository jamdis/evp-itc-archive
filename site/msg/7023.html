Frank, good files.  They know you so well, with the response about you testing the boxes.  The second file was so clear, not static at all coming through!~

 It's still looking like the sound chamber is completely un needed, and may even hamper the voices. What I get form the Ghostman, and even directly from a tuenr module is easier to understand that the ones through an sound chamber and mic amplifiers. the Gostman in direct mode yields longs, and more coherent voices than the original box, at least compared to what I was getting last night.
Tonight I'll modifiy #32 to get either direct recordings out of the tuner, or through the sound chamber so I can compare.  I had one from 2/5/08 from the Ghostman that said "that Earthquake will occur-------on the island near Chile (Falklands?).  There was a EQ today off Brazil, but no island there.
 
 DRV=direct radio voice
