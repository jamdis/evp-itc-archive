I&#39;m not gonna analyze anything, or spend excessive time on these files. I listen to the recordings a couple times, cuz I hear more the second time, but picking them apart usually &quot;creates&quot; more then is there. You could spend months on a file, slow it down, speed it up, reverse it... I was doing that yesterday with a EVPmaker session, could get entirely new comments by doubling the speed. Mostly, if they don&#39;t speak it plain, I&#39;m gonna ignore it. So don&#39;t go wasting alot of time.\n\n F-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Snowfire Lioness &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Ok, I&#39;m going to go through this one with a fine tooth comb, Frank, I used up the whole eng. alpha bet, plus the whole aramaic alphabet on separating the entire file in Wav format.  There might be something important in here, so I&#39;m a gonna look, both backward and forward.  Maybe, i&#39;ll learn something in the process. give me a couple of days on this one.
