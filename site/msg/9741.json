Sharing software applications is such a common practice it&#39;s easy to \nforget (or simply disregard the knowledge) that it is illegal, and people can and do get caught \nand fined for it.  Granted, the odds are slim, but no sense in providing evidence to &#39;piracy \npolice&#39; when you could just as easily protect yourself by not making communication of this \nnature viewable to everyone.  :-)\n\nMargaret"}
