Oil of oregano is an antibiotic and antifungal. It does not, however, kill 
off the intestinal bacteria that are so important to your digestion. It 
may help in the elimination of the H. Pylorii bacteria (the cause of 
ulcers).

It's pretty strong stuff, though, and will burn your mouth if taken 
directly. Put a couple drops in an ounce or two of another oil 
(recommended: coconut oil) and drink it that way if you can.

You can probably get it at a local health food store.
