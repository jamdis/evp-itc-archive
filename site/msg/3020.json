I have confronted them face-to-face while they were both vi=\r\nsible and invisable.  I have numerous times held conversations with them vi=\r\na voice recorder and once even one-on-one (it was the experience\n of a life=\r\n-time!).  I was Hunting Ghosts many, many years before it became a fad,  or=\r\n cool to do so.  And,  believe me,  I am far from being an &quot;expert&quot;.  I do =\r\nnot presume on Ghosts or their personalities.  Every time in the past that =\r\nI&#39;ve done so,  I&#39;ve been rocked back on my heels,  psychologically speaking=\r\n. Some are good,  some are not.  Many of them very much enjoy making you th=\r\ne fool (that&#39;s a lot easier done with some people than are others!) .  \nIt =\r\ndoesn&#39;t matter in the slightest what you Think of them,  They are what they=\r\n are,  and &quot;being a friend&quot; is definitely not on their list of priorities! =\r\n That goes for All of them.  They will play with you.  They will lie to you=\r\n.  They will tell, or imply to you, what they know you want to hear,  that =\r\nor they will laugh at you.  I have\n personally heard their laughter,  on mo=\r\nre than one occasion.  The first step in beginning to understand Ghosts is =\r\nto quit watching stupid TV Ghost Dramas,  and learn to be discernful about =\r\nReality.

After =\r\ndoing so my opinion on this box and the builders &lt;br&gt;intentions for it is.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;The box itself is not a knock off of Frank&#39;s box but a cheap and &lt;br=\r\n&gt;ineffective version of Joe&#39;s box,It works on an AM band instead of an &lt;br&gt;=\r\nFM band as Joe&#39;s box does. Another big difference is Joe&#39;s box &lt;br&gt;actually=\r\n works and you have all heard the files I have posted from &lt;br&gt;sessions wit=\r\nh it. After listening to this box and seeing it in &lt;br&gt;operation I feel tha=\r\nt anyone who purchases this box will be very &lt;br&gt;disappointed and will not =\r\nreceive any contact from it and even if &lt;br&gt;they did they\n probably would n=\r\not\n even realise it for the simple fact &lt;br&gt;that you have to have a certain=\r\n amount of experience with box &lt;br&gt;research and operation before developing=\r\n an ear for picking up real &lt;br&gt;time communication and also creating a bond=\r\n with the spirit friends &lt;br&gt;on the other side and also a measure of trust =\r\non both sides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believe the manufacturer to be a capitalist and onl=\r\ny interested in &lt;br&gt;the monetary reward to be gained from offering this che=\r\nap and &lt;br&gt;ineffective copy to unsuspecting and naive individuals who are &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;interested in this medium. I do not like to bad mouth anyone, it &lt;br&gt;usu=\r\nally comes back to bite you in the ass but I believe that our &lt;br&gt;friends o=\r\nn the other side know of our intentions and would not allow &lt;br&gt;someone wit=\r\nh the wrong intentions to develop a working tool for &lt;br&gt;communication. als=\r\no I believe that a person does not pick the box the &lt;br&gt;box picks the perso=\r\nn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So let him have his short and lucrative run with this\n fooling &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;unsuspecting\n clients, bad karma always comes home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bruce&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=\r\n=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private &amp;=\r\n confidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is addressed t=\r\no.&nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000=\r\nff&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000=\r\n0ff&quot;&gt;No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or forwarded=\r\n to other parties without explicit written permission.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;SPAN=\r\n style=3D&quot;width:100%;height:2px;border-bottom:1px solid rgb(212,208,200); b=\r\norder-top:1px solid rgb(128,128,128);background-color:black;overflow:hidden=\r\n; margin:8px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;  Boo!&nbsp;Scare away worms, viruses and so much=\r\n more!
