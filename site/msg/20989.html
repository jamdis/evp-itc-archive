&gt; Ok, he says &quot;the world wide animal, birds, fish, bees, bats, ducks, crabs,  
&gt; cows,whales, dolphins, buffalo,  etc...deaths are going to continue,  it 
&gt; seems they will all return after about 2 or 3 years or so after the permanent  
&gt; return of Christ to this world, this will occur after the antichrist has 
&gt; all but  destroyed all life, but JC will come back, and stop him.&quot;  David says 
&gt; that  &quot;the entire animal population may be nearly wiped out before Christ  
&gt; returns,&quot; things are going to only get worse,&quot; right now we are all living 
&gt; in  this bubble, thinking it won&#x27;t happen.
&gt;  
&gt; It&#x27;s very sad, I still can&#x27;t get David to tell me who it is that killing  
&gt; the creatures, he only says they will all be brought back to earth after JC&#x27;s 
&gt;  return.  So, stock up on canned food if you can guys, enough to last for 
&gt; at  least a year or 2, I buy mine a few extra at a time, and if you are 
&gt; translated  over, the food will be there for some one else that gets stuck here 
&gt; for that  near 3 years.  I keep hoping to win the lotto, like everyone else, 
&gt; then I  would put lots of food in here for people so, they don&#x27;t starve.   I 
&gt; have  the lake down here, our water is from a natural artesian spring 
&gt; water, it is 250  feet deep so, it&#x27;s pretty safe to drink.  And even if I lost 
&gt; electricity,  one could always get some water, from the lake out there which 
&gt; is private  too.  If I leave, anyone stuck here is welcome to come over here 
&gt; to live,  but you will need to probably keep up with the mortgage if there 
&gt; is still the  bank left.  Whatever, it&#x27;s going to be pretty bad from what I 
&gt; hear.  sf
