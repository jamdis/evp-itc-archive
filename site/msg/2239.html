&gt; Too bad you don&#x27;t have a box with a TV tuner adapter! The adapter  
&gt; is just an amplifier that jacks up the 8 volt tuning voltage for  
&gt; the radio up to 30 volts for the TV tuners, so the same sweep  
&gt; generator circuit is used for both. Unfortunate, kind of, that  
&gt; everything is digital now, and so you have to find old VCRs and TVs  
&gt; to use. Guess I&#x27;ll have to move this stuff into the 21st century  
&gt; one of these days.
&gt;
&gt;  As with the voice recordings, I just don&#x27;t have time to do alot,  
&gt; building this junk eats up most of my time.

&gt; Well, if they asked for it, then I am inclined to sit back, buckle  
&gt; my seat belt, and enjoy what is going to be a wonderful ride.

&gt; Yeah, matter of fact, &quot;they&quot;, or one of them asked for video on the  
&gt; session tape Chris and I did.
&gt;
&gt;  If I can find a video copnverter, I can post the whole videos. I  
&gt; found one that converts it to MP4, if ya don&#x27;t mind a banner  
&gt; blocking the video every few seconds.

&gt; Can you ask them to do something in these images that would  
&gt; indicate they are paranormal? I hate to say something like tell  
&gt; them to hold up a sign that says Hi Frank! but.....
&gt;
&gt; Did they tell you they wanted you to go this, BTW?

&gt;  Just the way they look, like the portrait images are like floating  
&gt; in a sea of black, yet some are coler images, the others are to big  
&gt; for the screen, like amateur video. I wouldn&#x27;t say they are all  
&gt; paranormal images, only that most are interesting, and probably  
&gt; something.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  BTW, thanks to those who did take a minute to look!

&gt;  Same as the voices I get, with a randomly tuned VCR tuner, removed  
&gt; from the VCR, and connected to cable. The tuner has line level  
&gt; video and audio out. I use a monitor to view the video, then  
&gt; &quot;captue&quot; it with the digital camera in camcorder mode. As with the  
&gt; voices, you can&#x27;t rule out with 100% certainty that it isn&#x27;t  
&gt; broadcast fragments, but a face surrounded in black!?

&gt;  These are from last night, at around 6pm.

&gt; Frank--how was this recorded? I can&#x27;t comment on the images at all  
&gt; unless I understand how you&#x27;re getting them.
