Hello Frank, 

I see most all of this as complete apophenia and pareidolia =
at best, but, and that is a very big BUT, you are the one real thing about =
the whole deal.
 
Chris Moon is a fucking hack!  A person that has done not=
hing but pimp your idea like a whore on a corner.  A self serving asshole w=
ho never gives back. Glory seeking son of a bitch who wants to make a name =
for himself at any cost!  Now that is the truth of the deal! 
 
From all I =
have seen, that is all you do is give back.  You ask for nothing.  
 
I mig=
ht not believe in any of this, but I do believe in the essence of what you =
are doing and how you are going about it.
 
STICK TO YOUR GUNS!  NEVER GIVE=
 UP AND DON'T LET SHITHEADS TELL YOU HOW TO RUN YOUR SHIP!

wing us only the tail of the lion, but I have no doubt that the lion belong=

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Afeter a long discussion...

=
 After a long discussion, and at times a yelling match with Chris Moon on t=
he phone...I have like zero memory for verbal stuff, basically I think it c=
ame down to he said-she said type deal. I could agree with some of what Mr =
Moon said, but the bottom line is--I don't care! I have had enough of these=
 endless pissing contests, one person telling me one thing, someone else te=
lling me something else. I'm not wise enough to tell who is telling the tru=
th. I'm done, I'm not discussing this stuff anymore, I'm not making boxes a=
nymore. I have absolutely no interest in the so called paranormal. I don't =
sell this shit, I don't make any money, all it does eat all my time and pis=
s me off. I'll finish this last box I'm working on, and that's it. No more =
e-mails, no more discussion-- I have had it!
 
 Mr Moon said he would be gl=
ad to come on the group and answer question--so there ya go, now is your ch=
ance. I'm not going to be the go between, nor will I participate.
