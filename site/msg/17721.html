Mr Moon hosts seminars, at which, you may see him do public demonstrations.=
=C2=A0 But if you want a private reading.... $$$ (I've heard several hundre=
d dollars an hour, with discounts to conference atendees).

So one suspects=
 the public demonstrations probably help to acquire private clientele.

I don't have the expert=

 right now.  So, I'm on this list, listening vicariously to others' experie=

I'm grateful for those who share their insights, ex=

Thanks again, Frank!
