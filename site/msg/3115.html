Hi All;
 
 In my always experimenting way. I have an older digital Walkman=
 AM/FM board. It use to be an AM/FM cassette, but I took the board out, and=
 threw the rest away. I ran acorss the board a month or so ago while lookin=
g for FM radios that I could rob parts from. The Walkman board has been sit=
ting on my shelf for a couple years, I forgot all about it. I can use a swe=
ep generator to sweep the tuning on both AM and FM of this Walkman. Then ju=
st make an amplifier for the headphone output to drive speakers. This is ho=
w I make cheap systems, albeit one of a kind. I also want to experiment wit=
h a diffenent method of making the sweep--get rid of the dual supply system=
!
