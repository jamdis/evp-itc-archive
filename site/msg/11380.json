Thanks for the edit\nand for the information. I&#39;ll make sure before I post again that I\nhave all the information straight. Not here to argue or anything as a\nmatter of fact I want to thank you for giving me the facts as they\nshould be. It&#39;s been a while since I actually read anything from WITC. \n\nAs I said, I was searching out ways to bring all the devices and their\nuses into one unit. It might help prove that the phenomena is real if\nI could get multiple confirmations on one unit. Of course you can\nalways just use many units at once and get the same effect. \n\nThanks for the info. \n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Guy&quot; &lt;yzzzguy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; There is NO research anywhere which shows that germanium diodes are \n&gt; superior to silicon diodes as far as the &quot;diode method&quot; is concerned.\n&gt; \n&gt; Konstantin Raudive didn&#39;t pioneer the &quot;diode method&quot; (sorry - exactly \n&gt; who did escapes me for the moment). I have a copy of &quot;Breakthrough&quot; \n&gt; which is the only English translation of any of Raudive&#39;s books and \n&gt; the &quot;diode method&quot; is described in an appendix. The diagram in the \n&gt; appendix note shown there (and I can scan in the page in the book and \n&gt; post here, if anyone likes) shows a typical 1N914 diode which uses \n&gt; silicon as the base semiconductor.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only &quot;transcommunication device&quot; I&#39;m aware of that specifically \n&gt; called out for the use of germanium was the one diagrammed by the \n&gt; spirits in one of the Scole Experiments (and even then - it was a \n&gt; block of this material - not a component diode).\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way - it was &quot;Konstantin Raudive&quot; (with a &quot;k&quot;), &quot;Franz Seidl&quot; \n&gt; (not Seidle...See Jean de Muelder&#39;s website for original diagrams of \n&gt; the Psychofon from Seidl&#39;s book \n&gt; http://jeandemeulder.transcommunicatie.nl/psychophone2.htm) \n&gt; and &quot;George Meek&quot; (no &quot;s&quot;). Additionally - George Meek&#39;s Metascience \n&gt; Foundation developed at least 5 different models of the Spiricom \n&gt; (most people are only familiar with Bill O&#39;Neil&#39;s Mark IV).\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;seanjankowski1&quot; &lt;seanjankowski1@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sure RetroCom,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; According to WORLDITC there are many different devices using \n&gt; different\n&gt; &gt; aspects of the radio and white-noise spectrum. Constantine Raudive\n&gt; &gt; used germanium diodes to capture EVPs. Siedle built his psychophone,\n&gt; &gt; George Meeks had the Spiricom tone device. Now you have the diode \n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; white noise, radio wave HF static, and a tone device. I am \n&gt; attempting\n&gt; &gt; to build an all in one audio recording and communication device. I \n&gt; am\n&gt; &gt; doing this to see if by having a combined unit you can get contact\n&gt; &gt; with either one or the other or perhaps multiple contacts at one \n&gt; time.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you define with some detail &quot;all ways&quot; ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- seanjankowski1@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;seanjankowski1&quot; &lt;seanjankowski1@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] All In One Device\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Wed, 25 Jun 2008 15:10:33 -0000\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is my first post.

I know that researchers such as Seidle had \n&gt; created\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the psychophone that seemed to cover many aspects of ITC but I \n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yet to see all ways of communication in one device.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have created an all in one design that covers most of the \n&gt; devices\n&gt; &gt; &gt; used.
