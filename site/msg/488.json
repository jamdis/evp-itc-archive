Mine appeared a bit dark but I \nshould examine it again. \n\nI was equally impressed with Alex MacRae and Paolo Presi for their \nkeen scientific scrutiny of the phenomenon. Even under close \nexamination, some submitted EVP&#39;s appear to be genuine paranormal \nphenomenon. EVP recordings are being subjected to some of the most \nvigorous digital forensic analysis techniques available. Of course, \nmany supposed EVP&#39;s can be debunked, but those considered supernatural \nin origin are classified as such due to audio characteristics that to \nnot comply with our physical world as science currently understands \nit. I would recommend any of the doubters to not jump to conclusions \nuntil reviewing the work of some of these great researchers. \n\nBetter yet, I recommend attempting to record EVP&#39;s themselves. Be \npatient, but diligent. Nothing convinces a person faster than personal \nexperience.\n\nCheers, Bill\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Vicki Talbott &lt;vtalbott1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Bill,\n&gt;   Good to see you here!  Enjoyed our lunch together and the \nconference.  Some of those presentations were excellent, weren&#39;t \nthey?  did you get a luminator picture with Mark Macy?  If so, did you \nget anything in it?  Take care, Vicki\n&gt; \n&gt; William Murphy &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;             Hello Frank, those who are advancing the study of EVP&#39;s \nwill likely always face the critics and doubters. Imagine what Tesla, \nEdison, Ford, the Wright brothers, and all the pioneers and early \nadopters have had to deal with. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Vicki, it&#39;s been nice reading your post. I am still absorbing all \nthe presentations including yours I heard at the AA-EVP Conference in \nAtlanta. I was your lunch time pal, Bill Murphy.\n&gt;"}
