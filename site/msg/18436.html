<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This stuff is not about people that can&#x27;t hear the voices, or see the
images in ITC, yet feel they are somehow more qualified to test. These
groups are not about ignore all evidence that other members get, and presume
you can test for paranormal activity.

 I don&#x27;t disagree with testing, but somehow spirit contact and paranormal in
general doesn&#x27;t seem to work that way. I think the best you can get is to
prove it for yourself, and if you can&#x27;t get anything, move on to something
that does work. Try fishing, or golf.

&gt;&gt; So I submitted a request to join the RTSC yahoo group, and it was denied.
&gt;&gt; I continue to be blown away by the fears and insecurities and cliches of
&gt;&gt; some of the people involved in RTSC. The group says:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &quot;This Board is dedicated solely to the research of Real Time Spirit
&gt;&gt; Communication. Any form of devices that are used in 2-way communication are
&gt;&gt; welcome here openly for all to share. This group is for the discussion,
&gt;&gt; promotion and development of new ideas to further this research. This group
&gt;&gt; was designed to take the next step in EVP to get away from conventional
&gt;&gt; methods. -Steve Hultay&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I suggest it add:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &quot;Unless you ask questions, experiment outside our box, or don&#x27;t agree with
&gt;&gt; what we state is so. Then you can&#x27;t join&quot;.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Amazing.
