Keep in mind guys that you can have an identical setup, the moon being in the correct phase and recording at the exact same moment and you can get different results. YOU are the medium not the "box", it is just a device to hear what you have received. No two people are equal in their results. If you expect to get the same results as Bruce you will always be disappointed. You will always get results depending on the strength of YOUR bridge.

            Hi, Bruce.  Can you clarify how your RS hack system is set-up when 

you are receiving messages such as this one and in the files: "11-26-

07_radio shack hack files_bruce" .  They seem much cleaner than what I 

am getting with the 12-469.  Are these recorded right out of the 

speaker with an amped mic picking up your voice and the speaker 

sounds?



Thanks...
