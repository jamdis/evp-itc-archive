<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all:
I just finished number 5 and posted a pic.  I also posted the an mp3
of its first 30 seconds of life.  The boxes seem to really talk a lot
when they are brand new.  They soon calm down but I have no answer for
this.  It is not because of the circuits or anything like that.  They
do not change or break in, they are always the same.  Any way check
out the clip and let me know.  This box was built into a handy talkie
radio case.  Its very small and a great way to do this.  It has a
rechargeable    battery pack.
