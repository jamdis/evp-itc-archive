That one has the &quot;seven&quot; piece in\nit. Is that shortwave or am? It&#39;s pretty amazing, I could hear\n&quot;testing, testing&quot; with other stuff coming through also. There is a\nvoice that sounds like identifying itself as Seven.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Yeah, those were pretty weak coming off the detector diode. I have \n&gt; since reconfigured the IF transformers getting a much stronger signal \n&gt; now. This may turn out to be a better chip for AM than that newer \n&gt; chip with FM. Tonight I was trying to get the RF amplifiers working \n&gt; for the shortwave bands. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That could be it. It&#39;s a pretty good capture, it prompted me to \n&gt; listen\n&gt; &gt; to it several times until I leaned so close to the computer my face\n&gt; &gt; got a static zing from the monitor.
