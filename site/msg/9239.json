I could probably make them a lot cheaper than they do. \nThe only drawback I have is that if they are double-sided boards, I can&#39;t \ndo plated-through holes and have to use &quot;C&quot; wires for thru-board \nconnections.\n\nZack\n\nOn Tue, 8 Apr 2008, Frank Sumption wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I hate to ask for anything. I can afford what I need for myself. What I want to do is make some printed circuit boards that have the sweep, and amplifiers, then I would only have to add whatever tuner I want to use to form a system, and I could make the boards available. I wouldn&#39;t mind putting this stuff together for others, but the requests/demands are so overwhelming, there just isn&#39;t enough time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S"}
