Also tonight I haven&#39;t had much luck with my RS 469.  I \n&gt; going to give the EVPm a shot again.

I have the sweep working so far, hopefully tomorrow I can test the \n&gt; radio with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; external sweep to see if it actually works. The frequency display is now useless, so it&#39;s \n&gt; face down, and the power and band buttons will be added to a new front panel. I&#39;m not \n&gt; sure if I want to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; make this direct out, or make it just like any other box. The audio should be more \n&gt; better than anything I&#39;ve done so for, at least it sounded real good when I was using a \n&gt; manual control, but only\n&gt;&gt; &gt; could tune half the AM or FM bands wihtout the negative tuning voltage component. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; The radio playing in the background is just C2C on a regular radio. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Windows Live Hotmail is giving away Zunes.
