One is old and shut down. The location is new to me with 3 recording sessions now. This day was a VERY good day with many EVP&#39;s on both DR60 and the B7 recorders. I increased the amplification in the area of the EVP&#39;s voice to help hear it otherwise MOST would not be able to find it. I found out today after just listening again that a little girl also says &quot;okay&quot; just before the main evp speaks. \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jim%27s%20RR-DR60%20EVP%27s/Brandon_Dillard_Brandon_Hyslope-BOOSTED%20-AUDIO-evp.wav \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/forms/general.htmlfiles\n\nRegards,\n\nclockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt;"}
