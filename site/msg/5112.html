&gt; Bruce, I now have done a few days testing with my rs 690, evp 
maker, audacity, a mic, and my handheld digital recorder.  Nada, 
nothing, zilch.  Maybe because I only get to scan past 5 to 8 
channels on Am or FM so I don&#x27;t have enough signals to muster a 
response.  But from what you and others with experience seem to be 
saying, it shouldn&#x27;t matter because I will get help from someone on 
the other-side.  Maybe they can&#x27;t find me in Mexico?  Please let your 
techs know I am here...should be no problem with immigration papers 
or money exchange.  I really need help.  Ron L

&gt; That may be, But I find that when I do a session mike and lisa both 
come through but mike seems to be the more dominant one.
&gt;  
&gt; I have asked that mike and lisa help in your sessions as well as 
other new researchers and they seem to comply but I think mike
&gt; is more like a supervisor and delegates actions to other techs. I 
know that if you do not have a perminent tech that whatever tech
&gt; is available at the time you do your session will be assigned to 
assist you. If it is lisa she is very sweet and will do her best to 
give you 
&gt; solid communication. I&#x27;m glad she can help.

&gt; 
&gt;       I&#x27;m getting the thought that Lisa is bouncing around between 
us. She&#x27;s very dominant every time I run a session and I&#x27;ve gotten 
some good stuff from her, which I will shortly be able to post, I 
hope. About a week ago, I got a really extraordinary sequence that 
ran something along the lines of a male saying, &quot;Lisa, can you do 
it?&quot; followed by a clear female voice saying, &quot;Testing. Beginning. 
Ground,&quot; and then a second female voice saying &quot;Kick.&quot; I was floored.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, Lisa seems to be the driver of a lot of what is going on 
right now. Maybe she intends to work with a number of us?

&gt;         Frank,
&gt;  
&gt; I have two techs that I speak with on a daily basis and one of them
&gt; is Lisa. She could possibly be contacting you with the technical 
info she tried to give me
&gt; yesterday.

&gt; 
&gt;       I&#x27;ve been getting Lisa too, but so far not in any segments 
tranfered 
&gt; to the PC. Even tonight I heard her, but not while I was taping.

&gt; &gt; Hmmmm. That second bit gave me the creepies, I must say. What are 
&gt; &gt; your thoughts on that, Bruce? I hear Lisa&#x27;s name at least a dozen 
&gt; &gt; times each time I run a session, so I feel confident that she is 
&gt; &gt; there, so I feel confident that I&#x27;m not in the hands of someone I 
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t want to be in. Maybe they are still auditioning for the 
role?
