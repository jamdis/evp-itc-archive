{"id": "21897", "subject": "legal issue?", "author": "Vicky Cox", "timestamp": "2011-08-18T13:32:53Z", "full_text": "I have a legal question that I cannot seem to find an answer to. I recently\nwent on an investigation to a public place with a  paranormal group. While\nmy experience is much less than theirs, I found them to be too disorganized.\nThree people came from the group. One had no equipment and the second used\nhis cell phone. I never even saw a pencil. So, I started a small group,\nspecifically for amateur investigators staying in local public places so we\ndon&#39;t get in over our heads. We aren&#39;t trying to get any resident\ninvestigations and are non competitive. On our site I put photos and evps I\nhad gotten while on the investigation and put at the bottom that some\nevidence was obtained while on investigations with other groups. I didn&#39;t\nuse any of their names. As with any of my photos, I blocked out any faces,\nand it was all on my equipment. I signed nothing and agreed to nothing.\nYesterday he sent me an email saying he wants it taken down. It&#39;s\ntechnically and legally his ( technically and legally?). If I wanted to\nstart my own group all I had to do was ask. He has said that I invited a 16\nyear old to join the group (Definitely didn&#39;t). And that he thought I would\njoin their group.\n-I don&#39;t believe he&#39;s right on the legal issue. Ethically, I would have\naccredited the group if he was more diplomatic and maybe even taken it down.\n\n- wouldn&#39;t making false accusations make him guilty of liable?\n- I don&#39;t need to ask him to do ****. I&#39;ve met him twice.\n\nDoes anybody know of any place where I can find something written on the law\nabout those photos and media being mine.\n\n-- \nVicky\n\nI ha e a legal ques ion ha I canno seem o ind an answe o.
