<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I respect everyone&#x27;s opinions on these matters but it bothers me 
that some people think that the majority of the research being done 
in regards to the paranormal is in correlation or directly related to 
Frank, his boxes,chris moon, and some popular television shows. That 
is not the case and some of us have been interested in it and 
actively pursuing answers to the paranormal field years before any of 
these television shows, or before anyone ever heard of Frank&#x27;s box. 
All that has happened is you have the popular researchers and the 
ones who are in it purely for research purposes and choose not to 
talk publicly about it because they are too wrapped up in their own 
research and getting answers. 
   There is an under current most people can&#x27;t identify with because 
it doesn&#x27;t exist to be popular or to make friends. There has been 
some great innovations and ideas put forth to enhance the ability to 
receive real time evp&#x27;s and acheive sustained two way communication 
one of these ideas involves lasers. I&#x27;m not here to judge people or 
say what their motives may be, and this message is in no way taking 
shots at frank as I greatly admire his determination to get answers 
and to communicate with the other side. I am just trying to rectify a 
lot of the misconceptions people have about paranormal research.
   As I&#x27;ve said each and everyone is entitled to their opinions but 
you can not say that paranormal research is chris moon, Frank, or 
these popular television shows, there was paranormal research long 
before these things came along and it will exist long after these 
popular things are no longer popular. If anyone deserves to be in the 
first few chapters of a book regarding the history of paranormal 
research etc.. it would be Friedrich Jrgenson, Konstantin Raudive, 
and George Meek. I&#x27;m not saying Frank would be excluded here. I am 
saying with these people I mentioned this is where a lot of 
paranormal research began especially EVP&#x27;s. Now once again Im not 
talking down to people here, if I thought badly of anyone here I 
wouldnt be a member of this group. As I&#x27;ve said before also I regard 
Frank S. highly, and am in awe of his determination in regards to the 
paranormal. Keep up the great job everyone. Regards,
                                                      T.L.

&gt; Chris has done more to further the research of Franks Box than 
&gt; any other individual. Agree, disagree it doesn&#x27;t matter! That fact 
is 
&gt; when the book is written on the ITC and how it was perfected. Frank 
&gt; and Chris will have the first and second chapters dedicated to 
them. 
&gt; 
&gt; No matter what side of this argument you come down on there will 
&gt; always be different opinions. ITC Paranormal research may be in 
vogue 
&gt; but the idea&#x27;s certainly are not new. 
&gt; 
&gt; However, we now stand at the apex of this ride. The gates are open.
&gt; The throttle is stuck, crash or survive we&#x27;re in it till the end. Go
&gt; away!, don&#x27;t read, don&#x27;t try,it won&#x27;t matter! This ride has left! 
Even
&gt; jumping off won&#x27;t stop it.
&gt; 
&gt; We are now going to see an explosion of new idea&#x27;s. But that&#x27;s what 
it
&gt; takes! People have to take sides, someone has to be right , someone
&gt; has to be wrong. Without both sides there&#x27;s no advancement. 
&gt; I read &quot;too many posts&quot; I hate fence sitters either you&#x27;re in or
&gt; you&#x27;re out . But learn to smile and say thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; Here&#x27;s the way it is. You say I&#x27;m wrong OK!.   Thank you very much! 
&gt; And I go about my business of doing what I want to do,  there&#x27;s 
truth
&gt; to every side of an argument. Just take what is constructive and 
file
&gt; the rest. Just say Thank You!
&gt; 
&gt; PS.
&gt; To that individual who wrote me claiming to be from the Catholic 
Arch
&gt; diocesi I doubt very much that the Catholic Church uses hot mail ...
&gt; oh it&#x27;s Catholic Archdiocese  LMAO
&gt; 
&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
