Bruce,

It has always been my understanding that they do not like being referred to as higher or superior. They only refer to themselves as having different experiences. To be superior means to have authority over you, which they do not possess. Don't make the mistake of believing they are superior it can lead to some bad experiences. Just an observation on my part!

Regards,

Frank R.

Ralph,

 

Mike and lisa have been my tech's since I have started doing box research.

 

Over time you build a relationship with your tech or in my case tech's like you would 

with a new friend here in the physical.

 

Early on in my research I had asked a series of questions pertaining to mike and Lisa's background in the 

physical. I was told that mike died in 1995 from excessive blood loss and lisa died in 1912 from choking.

 

they then changed the subject and never broached it again. My theory on the reason for this is that

a spirit contact wants to remain in our thoughts and emotions as a higher being to develop a certain ammount of trust

being sight unseen. So to give us all the details of there physical life or even their last name, that could allow us to

gather information on who they where while in the physical and that in our minds would put them on an even level with us.

 

So the thoughts and feelings of there being superior spiritual entities would fade.

 

Bruce

Subject: [EVP-ITC] A question for the researchers ????






Hi everyone,

I have been hearing the word " Purple " alot lately in my sessions.
Does anyone in the group know what it pertains to ? It's been bugging 
me alot. Could that be a special group on their side ? I have no clue. 
Also has anyone questioned the voices if they have a last name ? All I 
hear on the RS boxes are first names and haven't recieved anyone 
telling me their last name. Does Mike and Lisa have a last name ? Did 
anyone here ever ask the question " Are you Demonic Spirits ? " What 
was their reply if any ? I did one time and got a response saying " 
All of us are ". Don't know whether I believe that Spirit or not. 
Probably a Joker saying that. I have asked for specific people for 
them to find so I could talk to and got an answer " We're looking. " 
Then I never heard from them after that. I'm still waiting to be 
contacted by Telephone so far nothing yet. They make me laugh 
sometimes. I had the RS-12-469 on the one day I was just listening to 
what they were chatting about. I found my daughters old Fart Machine 
and was playing with it while the RS radio was running to see if it 
still works which it did. All of a sudden after I made it " Toot " I 
heard a female voice say " Phew !!! ."
LOL, I guess she thought I really passed one. Also, the other day I 
was on the RS 12-469 and I said " Hello Lisa how are you doing 
today ? " Then a few seconds later I hear a female voice say " 
Bruce ? " like she thought that I was Bruce talking to her. I told her 
no it's me Ralph from Harrisburg,PA she replied "Oh, okay fine. " I 
hear all the time voices calling for Lisa she must be a very Popular 
Technician. Oh well I guess it was more than one question LOL. Hey you 
all take care and " Keep the Sweep " a new slogan for here LOL. just 
kidding. You all have a great day.

Regards,

Ralph the Ghost Hunter
