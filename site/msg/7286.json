Over the usual clicking you get on AM \non the RS 469, I frequently get a loud click at what seems to be a \nconsistent time interval of almost 2 seconds before I get a response.  \nIs this fairly common?  And what&#39;s causing that?  Does he need to draw \nenergy from the RS469 before he can respond?\n\nSpeaking of which, are there technical terms for recordings in the \nspirit&#39;s own voice and for ones formed from bits of voices on the airwaves?\n\nI warned you that I had a lot of questions.  =)\n\nThanks!\n\nNellie\n\r\n--------------080008060809010305030505\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg;\n name=&quot;RS469 2-21-08 What did we have for dinner.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: inline;\n filename=&quot;RS469 2-21-08 What did we have for dinner.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------080008060809010305030505\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg;\n name=&quot;RS469 2-21-08 What kind of mood are you in.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: inline;\n filename=&quot;RS469 2-21-08 What kind of mood are you in.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------080008060809010305030505--"}
