That's fine, but I think your missing my point. My point is that this is no=
t evidence as far as science is concerned. That doesn't mean that your wron=
g, it just means that it doesn't constitute any kind of proof in the scient=
ific world.

If we presume that much of what is heard is in fact the result of personal =
