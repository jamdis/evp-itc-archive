<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, I understand where you are coming from, as I often get 
frustrated when I hear myself or another asking a question and there 
is an answer within the same audio from the spirits.  So I agree with 
this.  I only hear about 10% of the answers live, and find re-
listening to the recording at least two times is beneficial to catch 
everything.

However, we were at a lighthouse that was supposed to be haunted, and 
a lady asked if there was a &quot;Captain Babcock&quot; with us.  About 8 
seconds later, the reply, &quot;Spirit of Babcock&quot; came through clearly.  
The file is in my folder here.  So I do see value as well in asking 
questions.  The downside is we have a tendency to talk over them 
sometimes, yet, it is nice to provide the earthbounds direction to 
help them speak what we need to hear (to help them).  If people think 
they do not need help, then they haven&#x27;t been doing this enough in 
places where people in spirit are in trauma.  Believe me, some of 
them truly are and are in need of help - period.  

Perhaps there are two ways to do this, depending on what one is 
trying to accomplish.  At a haunted location, I seem to hear 
enlightened spirits, as well as earthbounds coming through.  This 
type of situation can be especially helpful to ask questions in my 
experience, as it helps to ferret out what&#x27;s going on there and 
provide &quot;evidence&quot; of intelligent responses to the questions.  This 
worked well to prove the spirit box as legit to the group who 
accompanied me.

When just trying to get &quot;higher&quot; messages from spirits, etc at home 
or elsewhere, I do think just letting it run and record is a great 
way to work with it, too.  This way, there are no expectations, just 
taking the time to listen for direction, messages of truth, hellos, 
etc.  Sometimes this way will really surprise you, especially when 
something comes through &quot;off the cuff&quot; and you are not expecting it.  

Frank, I hear your advice captain, but also want to throw in some of 
my personal experiences into the discussion.

&gt; Hi All;
&gt; 
&gt;  This is why I say don&#x27;t get so tied up asking questions and trying 
to 
&gt; get that one profound answer while missing all the real stuff. In 
the 
&gt; file I have in my folder of the 30 second test of #36, the very 
first 
&gt; voice is &quot;Thomas Edison(sung)--I Never Visited Frank&quot;, I did not 
hear 
&gt; this until the third time I listened to the entire session. I&#x27;m not 
so 
&gt; intent on runing session after session all friggin&#x27; day that I 
don&#x27;t 
&gt; have/take time to listen. If I was trying to hear this stuff 
direct, I 
&gt; would miss it, and simialr voices about 99% of the time. That&#x27;s 
why, 
&gt; forget the damn questions, and just listen--over and over till you 
&gt; think you&#x27;ve gotten it all. Even my dad, and son come through in 
their 
&gt; own time, I don&#x27;t costantly ask for them. I swear to God, they know 
who 
&gt; is listening, when you are listening/recording, and what you need 
to 
&gt; know! Trust it!
&gt; 
&gt;  I know, the idiot scientist type will insist you have to ask 
&gt; questions, and confirm the answers, but that is BS, and results 
little 
&gt; useful information. Useful, as in has personal signifgance.
