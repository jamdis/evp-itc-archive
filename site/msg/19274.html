<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>frank me too,they can hear our thoughts,because as you know they dont have physical vocal cords,they use thought to talk to each other and to us, but somehow we hear them through the radio or is it really our own minds using the noise of the radio to some how hear them speaking to us sometimes. could this be the reason why we all do not hear the same things sometimes ?

&gt; &gt; &gt;  I never, as far as I know, talk through the boxes, but I do use everything from time to time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank, do you talk through other boxes, like Shack Hacks etc, it would be fascinating to hear those, if you have any files...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Couldn&#x27;t you just say you don&#x27;t hear it the same, I don&#x27;t really give a crap &quot;what it really says&quot;!  No two people hear this stuff the same, and there is no one out there that has the one valid version of any given voice. People hear EVP different just like they hear music different. It gives some validiation when more than one person hears a voice the same, but mostly that is rare. Even minutes later I hear &quot;why bother numbnuts&quot;, or &quot;you&#x27;re the father numbnuts&quot;. I bet it don&#x27;t say anythin&#x27;!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Waste of time--??
