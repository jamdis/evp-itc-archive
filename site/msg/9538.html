<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi read books by Robert Monroe.

He had the ability to travel out of the body and go to
the Astral.

There are Technologically advanced Aliens that seem to
control the political situation in the Astral planes,
and they do not want Earth humans to develop full
communication with human spirits in the Astral.

WE HUMANS ARE BEING EXPLOITED IN THE ASTRAL PLANES,
that is why when communications are going good, all of
a sudden you no longer hear from the spirit any more,
THAT IS BECAUSE THE SPIRIT WAS FORBIDDEN to
communicate further.

WE NEED TO START DOING SERIOUS RESEARCH AND NOT GET
ALL EXCITED TO JUST HEAR VOICES.

WE also need to study the physics involved, this is
high energy physics.
