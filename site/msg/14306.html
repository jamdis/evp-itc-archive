Noone is saying what they hear is law, just their opinion.

   Soooo, everyone hears different, and personally=
 I find it offensive when someone presumes to tell everyone what another re=
searhcer's voices really say. I think EVP messages are for the one that rec=
orded thmm, to everyone else it's non-sense, except there's enough to show =
that there is a phenomenon. 

   I get really tired of these self proclaime=
d experts trying to dicate what's acceptable.

    this_one several listenings: noises, no speech

    The ones that took several listenings I though=
t I might hear words in, so I examined those several times. Sometimes I cou=
ld sort of hear something that sort of sounded like what you suggested, but=
 I could also hear it in other ways, or not at all.

    So my suggestion t=
o you, if you want to get less subjective conjuctures or simply less affirm=
ations of your own interpretations, is to post the future ones without labe=
ls. The labels you give can influence the listeners: when you have a sound =
that could be several things, and you note that it sounded like "keep it mo=
ving", the listener can find it nearly impossible to try NOT to hear what y=
ou heard, and so not be able to give a fresh perspecive to help your resear=
ch methods.
