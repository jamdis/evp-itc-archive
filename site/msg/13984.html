Hi, 
Years ago, in the late 60's I was the member of a spiritualist church in Detroit, MI, it was the best, we had a direct voice trance medium, she was up in age in her 80's she died in 1974.  Anyway, we had regular spirit meetings, right from Heaven, and spirit came through and told us that "one day people would have a thing that fits on the arm, like a watch with a cell the size of a dime,"  and we here would be able to talk with our loved ones on the other side.  They mentioned the word, "cell" before computer's ever came out.  Don't know who the inventor will be, it could be one of you folks perhaps, and I am letting you know now, that it is possible.  Sure wish I had one of those Spirit phone's you folks are able to build.  Well, just thought you would like to know, and I have passed it on to a couple of other people, now get to work!  <g>  btw.  Spirit told us that it is "true about Edison, he was working on a spirit box device to talk to the other side."   I  am looking for a set for myself, do you know of anyone that could make one for me or where i can get all the necessary equipment so i can start working with the one to one commumication, i'm not good at hooking stuff up so well, and wire are not my speciality.  But i believe you are all onto something very wonderful.  As i have informed a couple of people all ready, someone doing this type of research will eventually invent a product that will be worn on the arm like a watch.  Thanks so much,
sf
