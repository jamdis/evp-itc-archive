Well, if the waves have to bend around corners and work their way 
through chambers, that is an echo box in my opinion, as the sound waves 
are delayed and thus slowed down by doing so.  I think you are fine to 
call it an echo box, as slowing down the sound may be why it helps the 
sound of the voices become more discernable.  Bruce slows his 
recordings down a bit to make them easier to hear, as well.  One way is 
by a box of chambers, the other by way of a computer program.

Sounds good to me, Frank.

&gt;  This  is from #24 and the big echo box. I was going to stop 
callingit an echo box, but that despite the critisim, that still seem 
sotbe the best description.   First the voice says &quot;Bombs hit England&quot;, 
then &quot;length of channel doubles energy&quot;, so I&#x27;m not sure if they mean 
the echo box channel, or the English channel. I&#x27;m not sure the bombs 
hit england voices isn&#x27;t left over energy from WWII. that&#x27;s wy I say 
you can&#x27;t tell what l;evel is coming through, or the source, so don&#x27;t 
take any of this stuff as gospel, unless it&#x27;s unmistakable.   Frank-S
