Since only a limited number of 1st print=\r\nings have Chapter 8, &quot;The Realms Beyond&quot;, then I suspect 1948 would be the =\r\ndate of the first printing.\n\n        Each chapter ends with the year Mr. Ed=\r\nison wrote it (it is primarily his diary).  The part about spirit communica=\r\ntion is dated 1922.\n\n        Obviously a 61 year old book is a bit fragile =\r\nso I&#39;ll start trying to scan those pages but I&#39;m not going to hurt the book=\r\n for it.\n\n        I suppose I just post them as JPGs in an email?

His family had that version of the biography recalled an=\r\nd reissued it without the last chapter.\n\n                          Anyway i=\r\nn this last chapter, Edison alludes to a way to communicate with the dead b=\r\nut he never says he did it.  He simply hypothesizes on how it could be done=\r\n and the fact that the dead are just on a different wavelength than the liv=\r\ning.\n\n                          Sorry, no links...

I need to find the actual pa=\r\nge count from my copy but I went to amazon&#39;s used books and asked every sel=\r\nler how many pages their copy was.
