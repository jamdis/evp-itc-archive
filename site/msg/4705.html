<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Newbie here! my name is D`Ana, and i live in south texas. I recently 
got interested in e.v.p. due to the fact I have received it, without 
reason? Let me make sense of that! I was just video tapping my husband 
with my phone cam, and realize the video looks distorted, so i wasnt 
goin to use it, i thought a moving picture would be more real for 
others to see. Being friends far the past i had come into connact to 
because of the great ole myspace were wondering why I didnt have a 
picture of him up. keep in mind the t.v. wasnt on, except for the one 
he was playing a racing game on, and he turns the volume off of it, 
because it aint worth listening to if i am trying to watch my show, 
well i turned my t.v. off and went to video record him, and afterwards 
goin over it, i heard a very distinctive e.v.p. saying i love you.. 
nobody is talking, not even me, and you can hear it real well.. let me 
know how to send it and i will let the group see for themselves</pre>
