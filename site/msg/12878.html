Greetings fellow researchers,

While listening to the Coast to Coast AM ra=
dio show last night I heard
something that was very interesting and surpris=
ing. The guest during the
hours I listened was Tim Swartz, and he was talki=
ng about the 'lost
journals' of Nikola Tesla.
During the conversation Swart=
z mentioned that Tesla, while living in
Colorado Springs, had radio recepti=
on equipment on which he received
signals he did not believe were terrestri=
al. Some of those signals even
contained speech, in english. Tim Swartz mad=
e a comment during the show
that associated Nikola Tesla with EVPs. Awesome=
!

Now... we all have heard that that Thomas Edison was the guy who was
tho=
ught to have been the one with an association with what may have been
EVPs =
and an actual device for contacting them, but could it be that
Nikola Tesla=
 is the guy who really should be given the credit for that?
Do these 'lost =
journals', now found, have details or data which provide
documented proof t=
hat Tesla may have been communicating... or at least
listening to communica=
tion from beyond.

If it wasn't terrestrial in his opinion, I would imagine=
 he considered
them to be extra terrestrial or possibly inner terrestrial.
=

What is really cool from my vantage point... I live only three minutes
fro=
m where Nikola Tesla would have done those experiments and made that
commun=
ication contact. His lab was located on a hill within a 3 minute
drive; a p=
lace I have visited numerous times and attempted to capture
EVP at.

It was=
 when I first started my interest/investigation in EVP that I went
to where=
 the Tesla lab was, and using a simple device I constructed,
tried my luck =
at EVP capture.
Now that I have a number of other devices to use, and now t=
hat I know
that Tesla may have been the pioneer in EVP discovery, I will pr=
obably
go back there with my devices and make some additional attempts.   C=
ool
stuff...!!!
Here's a short excerpt from the Swartz book regarding Tesla=
 and the
EVPs:

Chapter 5 - Tesla and Electronic Voice Phenomena

No one ca=
n deny that computers and electronics have forever changed our
way of life.=
 There are electronic controls and computer chips in
everything from the sm=
all appliances that toast our bread to the cars we
drive, and make possible=
 myriad forms of new entertainment, from VCRs
and DVDs to video games and t=
alking stuffed toys.

For a number of years some people have claimed that e=
lectronics can be
useful in a quite unexpected way: to contact the dead, or=
 at least allow
the dead to contact us. Obviously, these claims are highly
=
controversial. They make many assumptions: that there is life after
death, =
that the dead are interested in contacting us, and that they have
the means=
 by which to do so.

The mysterious signals that Tesla received could be li=
nked to what is
now known as Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP). Tesla was on=
e of the
first men to experiment with the necessary electronic receiving
eq=
uipment. The very same equipment, albeit more sophisticated than Tesla
had =
access to, is being used today to receive EVP.

Many people experimenting w=
ith Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) and
Instrumental Transcommunication (I=
TC) say they have received messages
from "the other side" through radios, t=
ape recorders, VCRs, televisions,
telephones, and even computers.

These ph=
enomena have manifest themselves since the appearance of the
instruments th=
emselves. EVP, for example, has been reported for well
over 50 years or mor=
e: Strange voices being picked up with primitive
radios during WWI and hear=
d faintly on magnetic recording tape.

Tesla may have been the first to rec=
eive these electronic voices from
another plane of reality. As with other m=
odes of communications with
alleged discarnate entities, care must be taken=
 not to be swayed by the
stories often told by beings from the other side. =
Tesla may have been
duped, so-to-speak, by voices that only pretended to be=
 creatures from
other planets.

This is nothing new to those who are famili=
ar with the tall tales told
to them by spirits who claim to be ascended mas=
ters, Abraham Lincoln or
Ashtar of the Interplanetary Space Command. Spirit=
s love to tell lies to
anyone who will listen.

Those such as Tesla and Mar=
coni who experimented with radio early on
were the first to report anomalou=
s sounds and voices emanating from
their radio receivers. These early repor=
ts were looked upon as mildly
interesting curiosities and quickly forgotten=
.

Theosophist Alice Bailey in 1936, transcribed these words of her great
t=
eacher, the Tibetan Master DK:

"Within the next few years the fact of the =
eternity of existence will
have advanced from the realm of questioning into=
 the realm of certainty.
Through the use of the radio by those who have pas=
sed over, will
communication be set up and reduced to a true science."

It =
has been widely written that Edison and his assistant, Dr. Miller
Hutchinso=
n, were seriously at work building a machine to achieve spirit
communicatio=
n. Tesla wrote in his journals that Thomas Edison had heard
from other engi=
neers that Tesla had been receiving mysterious voices and
sounds over radio=
 frequencies that were not conducive for the
broadcasting of the human voic=
e.

Edison, who publicly mocked Tesla and his experiments, privately
believ=
ed that Tesla had managed to find the correct frequency to enable
communica=
tion with spirits of the dead. Edison was determined to
discover Tesla's se=
cret, and be the first to get the "Spirit Phone" on
the market.
