&gt; &gt; Opinion follows:
&gt; &gt; I think what most people forget when they view the reality TV shows
&gt; &gt; such as Door to the Dead, Ghost Hunters, Paranormal State, etc.,
&gt; are
&gt; &gt; that these ARE Reality TV shows and nothing more. I watch them as
&gt; &gt; entertainment, and nothing more.
&gt; &gt; Yes, there are some real investigations going on concerning the
&gt; &gt; paranormal, EVP, ITC spirit communication, entity dicovery, etc.,
&gt; but
&gt; &gt; 99.9% of the time you will not be witnessing a real investigation
&gt; &gt; going on in a reality TV show. (G.H. DttD, P.S., etc.)
&gt; &gt; These type venues are about making money in the form of advertising
&gt; &gt; dollars.
&gt; &gt; Your REAL investigations are being done by &#x27;unknowns&#x27; and people,
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; groups with nothing more than a few tools and a cheap video camera;
&gt; &gt; not TruTV, Discovery Channel, or History Channel.
&gt; &gt; You usually don&#x27;t see REAL investigations on TV.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, Ghost Hunters is the self proclaimed number one paranormal
&gt; venue
&gt; &gt; on the tube, but do you really think they are following REAL
&gt; &gt; investigative techniques?
&gt; &gt; If you&#x27;ve seen the show... you should have that answer.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; G.H. is scheduled to come to a local Inn near me; an Inn that has
&gt; &gt; very very few incidents of paranormal activity in its past history.
&gt; &gt; BUT, I bet when I see that episode on G.H., there will be more
&gt; &gt; activity in the first hour of the show than has gone on in the
&gt; entire
&gt; &gt; history of the INN. WHY??? Becasue it&#x27;s reality TV and to make
&gt; &gt; money they have to induce activity and action... otherwise no one
&gt; &gt; will watch.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So... bottom line. Don&#x27;t view shows like G.H., Door to the Dead,
&gt; &gt; Paranormal State, and the others as the definition of an
&gt; &gt; investigative series... watch them for the entertainment value, and
&gt; &gt; you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Okay... stepping off the paranormal soapbox now.
&gt; &gt; Thanks for listening!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am pleased that the outcome for the family was positive. And I
&gt; am
&gt; &gt; not surprised. The key I think is that a belief system was
&gt; &gt; successfully altered. This in turn likely impacted the focal
&gt; person,
&gt; &gt; who based on the limited information presented could have been the
&gt; &gt; young man.
&gt; &gt; .........to achieve them most likely.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for your interest as this is an important topic of
