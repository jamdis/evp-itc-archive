Why are you being so mean to people RJ?  We've all gotten lots of

lost bird, and she was right where they said she'd be.  sf

"   So RJ--where's your EVPs? How can a  skeptic type judge ot=
hers research 
if he don't do any research? Like a  food critic that only d=
ines at 
MacDonald's, yet critiques major  restaurants. 

I wouldn't waste =
anyone's time  by  posting a bunch of radio snippets that 
"Sound like some=
thing".  I  would post one if it ever actually seemed proof 
of intelligent=
  communication to me: for example, a bunch of consistent 
predictions,  po=
sted before the event, read by all, then confirmed afterwards.   
That woul=

Since I have =

Actually, it's more  interesting than that.  Not only do you not contr=
ol 
what  the 'spirits' say, you also don't control what broadcast radio  s=
ays, 
and to a large extent you don't control what your brain  finds and in=
terprets 
in the noise you are hearing.

I  listened to these (trying not t=
o look at the labels, since  once a 
person looks at the labels, they prime=
 their brains to  interpret the sounds in 
YOUR way, not their own way).  T=
o  me, they were either just a mess of random 
radio snippets,  exactly wha=
t you'd expect if a 3 year old were randomly  
twisting the radio dial, or =
they were just noise.   Nothing paranormal in the 
least.

I think your ins=
tinct  to stop posting this stuff might have been a good 
one. I  suspect y=
ou are feeling a bit overwhelmed with this field  right now, 
and it may be=
 something is nagging at you inside  someplace, saying it is a 
waste of yo=
ur time or a burden on  your life and health, or that you just 
need a litt=
le more  space for a while.

In any case, I'd recommend a break:  take a ni=
ce month off.  See how you 
feel being away from  all this for a while.  Co=
me back fresh if you feel ok  
after that.  But if you feel obsessed when a=
way, it might  be good to ask 
your friends and loved ones for some opinion=
s  on what they see in you.  Your 
health is more important  than anything =
here anyways, and you can't really do 
a job with  interpretation of your r=
esults, much less your other  
responsibilities in life, unless you put you=
r health  first.

Well, got no response out  of the other list,=
 let's see if any of you folks 
on these  lists can hear these at all. They=
 may be too  fast, but I did try 
to slow them a bit,  I  know, these are v=
ery hard to hear, got them last 
night  in response to Steve's letter about=
 all the  "religious"  crap I've 
been sending,  such weird  files I someti=
mes send in lately.  I do not control  
what spirits say though, after all =
they are just people too.  Got one on 
here that's really funny, I think it=
 has a  little demon on it too, he seems 
very angry, and wants  someone to=
 "Let me out!  Let me out!" is what he is  
saying, I think he is wanting t=
o come after some  folks, because, even 
demon's believe in God.  He  reall=
y sounds mad at some people and wants 
".....out," just  going to let you h=
ear it, may need to play it several times  to 
hear, but I think its kinda =
cute. I told them  what some on the lists were 
saying, and this  was the r=
esponse.  btw  Is someone going to  Florida ?  The 
last one says something=
 about FL Hope  you all enjoy them. sf
