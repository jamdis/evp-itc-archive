<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Steve,

I don&#x27;t know anything about wiring or electronics, but I&#x27;m wondering if, 
with both boxes going, it does something to your wiring?  Not because of the 
spirits, but just because it creates a load? LOL, load is probably not the 
correct electrical term..  Or is your wiring okay?  I hate to see you frying 
all your appliances!!

&gt; Wow, that&#x27;s a lot of info to think about.  I thought i was alone
&gt; with this.  When i first started i had asked for a sign that i was
&gt; actually speaking to someone and my ceiling fan stopped for a few
&gt; seconds and than started again.  The next day it wouldn&#x27;t work at
&gt; all, so i pulled the switch out of the wall and it was completely
&gt; fried.  I luckily had a spare and re-installed it and it works fine
&gt; again, but lesson was learned from that.  Don&#x27;t ask for a sign b
&gt; ecause you never know what they will do, and that goes for with or
&gt; without a box.  They do listen and will pull energy from anywhere
&gt; they can to achieve it.  I think that explains the appliances going
&gt; out, i will ask a question and right before they answer something in
&gt; the house will flicker or go out.  Sometimes they say &quot;I did that&quot;
&gt; to take credit for shutting something off.  It&#x27;s all about energy
&gt; and how we use it in life and in death.

&gt;&gt; I never paid much attention as to which boxes produced more
&gt; negatives, but I
&gt;&gt; used to get alot when I first started this stuff. I tend to ignore
&gt; those,
&gt;&gt; and sometimes if it&#x27;s in a segment I copy to the computer I&#x27;ll
&gt; play it
&gt;&gt; backward. Reversed, sometimes the evil voices are angelic.  That&#x27;s
&gt; curious
&gt;&gt; about it shutting off aplliances, I thought those ran on internal
&gt; batteries.
&gt;&gt; Maybe you&#x27;re getting a lesson in energies?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I did get a quake warning in last nights test, it said  China
&gt; suffers a
&gt;&gt; quake, followed by August 11. I usually don&#x27;t get dates, or
&gt; locations, so I
&gt;&gt; guess wait any see, of maybe they can evacuate China? Often, when
&gt; a quake is
&gt;&gt; coming I get a wolf image, well there&#x27;s a wolf face on the shower
&gt; window,
&gt;&gt; kind of a medium size wolf, so I think if there is a quake it
&gt; won&#x27;t be real
&gt;&gt; severe, maybe like a 6 or 7. Wolves for quakes, cats for wind, and
&gt; bears for
&gt;&gt; tsunamis, which I didn&#x27;t know ahead of time. For Katrina I had a
&gt; cat(image)
&gt;&gt; with huge round eyes.

&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Does anybody think it&#x27;s possible to get 2 extreme opposites in
&gt;&gt; &gt;communication?  1 Box curses at me constantly and tells me to die
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;also talks about the end of the world and hell.  And the other one
&gt;&gt; &gt;talks about how pretty it is there and i always get &quot;Hi&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m
&gt;&gt; &gt;Here&quot; as well as &quot;Don&#x27;t leave&quot; when i&#x27;m signing off and an
&gt;&gt; &gt;occasional &quot;Goodbye&quot;.  Has anyone experienced anything like this
&gt;&gt; &gt;before?  The 1 box even shuts off appliances in my house when i
&gt; use
&gt;&gt; &gt;it, i guess i&#x27;ll stop using that one for now until i figure out a
&gt;&gt; &gt;solution to what&#x27;s going on.  Any ideas?????
