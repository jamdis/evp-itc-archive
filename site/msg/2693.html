Welcome back Linda.
   
  Yeah I have that, tried it, couldnt figure it out, havent had time to try it again yet. Theres a couple around who have used it successfully. One is out of town but she may reply when she gets back.
   
  For me it just kept feeding back louder and louder until it was overwhelming loud noise, so I was doing something wrong.

          Hi,it's been awhile since I've logged on here but just popping in to 
say hi gang! Glad that y'all are here!

I saw some information in another ITC forum about DC Six, an audio 
editor that allows one to record EVP in Real Time... and it's 
awesome! Has anyone here tried out the demo version of this program 
that's now been updated to DC Seven? 

Anyway, I've been experimenting with it and it's really amazing. I 
can talk into it and some of my EVP contacts answer back right away. 
But because I am not knowledgeable about sound recorders except for 
the basics when it comes to editing my EVP, I would like to know if 
someone here could download the 10 day trial version of DC Seven and 
let me know what you think about it. I'm having a few problems with 
getting it to work as it's probably supposed to work... mainly having 
a problem with feedback and so on.. 
Here's the link to DC Seven's 10 trial demo:
http://www.enhancedaudio.com/dc_seven.htm
Hope someone here will try it out because I would love to know if it 
works for you!
