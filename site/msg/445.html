Do you know what the bridges name is? Where is it located? Perhaps someone here can find out some info for you. 
   
  I dont know why they wouldnt want to share the history with you now, its a little inconvenient to wait til you meet up again LOL
   
  It was interesting that you said the brisges history goes back to the 1700's because the "students" voice sounded like it had an english accent for me. I'd be curious to know more about early settlements and history that dates back to a time when americans were indeed still english immigrants.
   
  have fun on your trip

  I REMEMBER SOMEONE TELLING ME THAT SOMEONE WAS HUNG THERE AS WELL, "IT HANGS ME" BUT NOW NO ONE WANTS TO TELL ME WHAT THE HISTORY IS, SO I CAN CONFIRM THAT RIGHT NOW . THEY ALL WANT TO WAIT TO TELL ME IN PERSON THE HISTORY WHEN WE MEET UP AGAIN. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! THIS IS RIDICULOUS! <SP> ALSO REMEMBER SOMEONE SAYING ABOUT A CAR CRASH THERE WHERE A KID WAS KILLED CAR SURFING. SO, I CAN ASSUME THAT BY WHAT I REMEMBER AND WHAT YOU GOT ON EVP IS CORRECT.
  YOU GUYS ARE UNBELIEVABLY MAGNIFICENTLY AWSOME!
   
  RESPECT!
