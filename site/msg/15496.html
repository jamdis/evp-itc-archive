Naw, I would have been dead long time ago then, I hear my named called all  
the time, it's usually my mom letting me know she's around, without the 
radio  (box) I've heard it called, when I'm trying to sleep, in my ear too.  I 
was  once listening to yahoo chat where someone was giving their idea of 
Scripture,  and the religion they belonged to, which had certain beliefs, that 
I did not  agree with, I feel asleep, and I heard a very distinct voice come 
into my right  ear saying, "Bonnie, I will teach you the Bible" guess that 
person didn't want  me to listen to that person anymore thought I'd be led 
astray or  something.   But, little do they realize my conviction is so 
strong,  it will never brake down, sure I get upset sometimes when things don't 
always go  my way, but nothing can take what I know away that is, what I know 
to be  true.  It's all a matter of perception, that is so, but in one way 
or  another we are all shown at some point, that there really is a "Prime 
Mover,"  and there really is no death, it's only becoming unwired from our 
physical body,  and going home. Bonnie
Here are a couple more files,
One is of a couple fella's name's, and the other one is telling me I guess  
to get use to feeling tired, geez great!

There's another meaning---when you talk to the spirits it's talking to  
death, maybe in a metaphorical way, and when they call your name that's like  
death calling your name--maybe? Just a thought.
