<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think Frank said it best when he said it gets tedious with longer
sessions.  As you do more sessions, you will want to continue conversing
with the Others for as long as possible.  But, upon playback, careful
analysis (with headphones and Adobe Audition) takes me an hour for every 5
minutes.  So three sessions a week at 15 minutes a session can eat up a lot
of time.  So I try to keep my home sessions to 10 minutes or less.  There
are times when they are not too communicative and I keep pressing on past 15
minutes and I always dread it when I do because there is so much more to
listen to.

In the field, it is a different story.  Session times can go from 15 to 40
minutes and leave you with a helluva lot of audio to consider.  Being very
active in investigations and home sessions can make going over the audio a
very dreadful process if you inundate yourself with longer sessions.

So my advice?  Keep it under ten unless you are getting something fantastic.
 Also, keep a word file on every session file that documents the time and
communication received in the session for future reference.  Sometimes
people and messages come across that I got over a year ago and I would have
never known it if it weren&#x27;t for the files I keep.

Hope this helps.

&gt; I would go at least 10 to 15 minutes, but that&#x27;s just in my own experience,
&gt; which is not very extensive. What do some others on here have to say? I&#x27;m
&gt; actually curious about this question myself.

&gt; &gt; I have recently started doing EVP Maker sessions in my home and have
&gt; gotten results (Rudy&#x27;s Folder) from two of the first four sessions. I have
&gt; only been doing five minute sessions at a time. Is this too long or too
&gt; short of a session time?
