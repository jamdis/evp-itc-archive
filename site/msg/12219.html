<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">for Misty   Not a surprise here about ETs being involved.  From day one I have been sort of tracking what is reportedly said about "who is involved and who is in charge" of communications on the others side.  I hope more researchers ask the question so we can all compare notes.   For example, one evper report there are 10,000 "communications stations" staffed on the other side.  My question are; staffed by who or what, what is their purpose, do they have regulations for what can be said to this side, and many, many more questions.  Like it has been said, if we knew all the answers this would not be research.  Hope to hear more on this from you and others.  Thanks for that....ron<BR><BR>--- On <B>Sun, 9/21/08, Misty Dawn <I><bulletbabea@...></I></B> wrote:<BR>
