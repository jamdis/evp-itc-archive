Yes, I am Babs from Atlanta and co-founder of The Psi Network.\nJim had mentioned you a while back so when you signed up here I know\nwho you were. I have listened to your files, the &quot;Gino&quot; one was\ninteresting. \n\nJim brought the 469 to a holiday party here at my house a few weeks\nago. It did seem as if we were getting answers that I found incredibly\neasy to understand. Unfortunately we had all had cocktails so I knew\nit was no where near objective. Two days later I made the purchase and\ncompleted the hack. \n\nI have had several unsuccessful sessions which frankly (pardon the\npun) is what I expected. My goal is to make a determination based on\nmy trials. After the initial party session, subsequent sessions have\nbeen done by me alone. The next step for me will be to bring in a\ngroup of people who will make notations (non-verbal) as to what they\nthink they hear. I&#39;m doing this because I believe strongly in the\neffects of energy and people on these devices. The non-verbal\nnotations need no further explanations. I will also place people where\nthey can&#39;t see if someone is writing something. \n\nOn a recent post of Juli&#39;s (I believe) she mentions hearing Bruce and\nSteve&#39;s voices coming through her device. If that&#39;s the case then I\nthink a lot more objective study is needed, in particular with the RS\nversions and the mini-box (those using linear sweep methods). Now\ndon&#39;t get me wrong here... I have heard compelling files from these LS\nmodels. However, we all know the inherent problems with naming files\nwhat we think we hear. The listener than expects to hear the same\nthing and typically does. Also, I have heard files that seem to be a\ndirect, intelligent response to the question asked but what I would\nlike to see is the question asker request a certain word to be spoken\nand have that happen within a certain time frame. We should be able to\nsay &quot;Say Bruce or Babs or Steve....&quot; and have that happen rather\nquickly. A list of control questions could easily be developed that\nwould add to the credibility of these devices and could only help\nresearch move forward. Has anyone asked whether or not the spirits\ncould see us as well as hear us? If the answer is yes than that leads\nto a whole other set of questions whose answers could easily be verified. \n\nI realize that the majority here are not interested in the idea of\ndisproving but I think it needs to be done. Controlled study is a\nnecessity.  \n\nBabs\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Babs,\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you out of the Atlanta area?  If so are you from PSI?  My cousin \n&gt; Jim is in PSI, and purchased a 469 for the group.  He had heard some \n&gt; of my initial recordings of experiments I ran for audio set-up.  They \n&gt; were recorded with the 469, and did not come through until the 5th \n&gt; test for me.  It was as if the mish mash began being manipulated and \n&gt; I could then hear responses.  The recordings are under LC&#39;s... in the \n&gt; file section.  I currently have two 470&#39;s which will be experimented \n&gt; with after the holidays...\n&gt; \n&gt; The more you work with the box, the more those on the other side \n&gt; become aware of one&#39;s attempts at making contact, IMHO.  For me, I \n&gt; can feel a spiritual presence when the audio bits/white noise begin \n&gt; being manipulated.  When in doubt, just keep making \n&gt; recordings...sooner or later you will begin hearing words, responses, \n&gt; sentences.  Some of what I heard has been quite crafty, such as \n&gt; giving me my wife&#39;s name clearly, right before she phoned me, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;babiarz3&quot; &lt;babiarz3@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks Juli, it&#39;s nice to be back. Holiday times always get so \n&gt; hectic.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On a side note here- I&#39;ve been working with a 469 shack hack and \n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; yet to get anything I can consider a direct response or intelligible\n&gt; &gt; communication. IMO, thus far, I hear nothing besides radio \n&gt; fragments.\n&gt; &gt; Going on the theory that this device enables the same real time 2-\n&gt; way\n&gt; &gt; communication as Frank&#39;s Box or it&#39;s &quot;children&quot;, requesting that my\n&gt; &gt; own name be said doesn&#39;t seem like it should be a difficult task. I\n&gt; &gt; have even told them my name, as a just-in-case measure. Nothing even\n&gt; &gt; resembling my name, or in name for that matter. When asked what \n&gt; their\n&gt; &gt; name is, also nothing but radio fragment. Sessions with EVPmaker \n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; always provided intelligent responses and results.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, juli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nice to see your back in the swing of things!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; babiarz3 &lt;babiarz3@&gt; wrote:          Here are a few links to some\n&gt; &gt; of Chris&#39; public sessions with the Box.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; These files are easy enough to find.

I have heard \n&gt; several \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where some of the audio is clear enough to stand on its own \n&gt; without \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his interpretation, and where his interpretation generally \n&gt; agrees. I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have also heard some where the audio I hear disagrees with his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation, but not to such a high degree that I was \n&gt; overtly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; troubled by it--it was in what I would call the high-end of my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tolerance range for subjectivity. I have heard audio where the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person asking questions of the box clearly heard answered that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appeared to move them greatly without dependance on Chris&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, to try to sum up for you, my personal investigation led me \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe that something was happening with the box. I did not \n&gt; always \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; agree with Chris&#39;s interpretation, but it appeared the same or \n&gt; close \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to what I heard a high enough percentage of the time that I was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; willing to accept he was not faking it, but giving it an honest \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough go. It led me to start hounding Frank for a box of my \n&gt; own, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later to buy a minibox from Rick, since poor Frank was beset on \n&gt; all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sides. ;)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We&#39;ve already had some spectacularly burning arguments about \n&gt; what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris claims his guides or technicians tell him behind closed \n&gt; doors. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, no audio of this is public, so his claims \n&gt; can&#39;t be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaluated. I think the proliferation of people getting results \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the boxes belies his assertion that only 30 are chosen.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Dec 30, 2007, at 11:09 PM, Robin Henson wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think some of you were discussing this recently, but I&#39;m \n&gt; wondering\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what you all think.
