I only have a minute to respond, but will come back later.  I have gotten only \nONE clear (class A) EVP with my DR60.  Most everything is garbled (but intelligible much of \nthe time) yet I still find it a fascinating little unit.  My clip is titled &quot;This is Shawn that&#39;s \ntalking&quot; and it&#39;s in the folder called &#39;traditional evp&#39; under my main folder.  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, urkel23@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I got this recorder a couple weeks back, but haven&#39;t messed with it  much.  \n&gt; But every time i record, i get an EVP.  This recorder is really  strange, it \n&gt; seems like it doesn&#39;t have great sound quality for recording  us.  The answers \n&gt; are much clearer than the questions.  I know this  isn&#39;t box research, but it&#39;s \n&gt; still communication.  Like i said, i never  settle on one style.  To me, all \n&gt; styles work and if you mix it up it will  never get boring as long as we are \n&gt; getting results.  Here are just  a few traditional Evp&#39;s i thought were pretty \n&gt; good and worth sharing, the  thing is that i hardly had to touch these files.  \n&gt; What you hear is pretty  close to the original files, listen and let me know \n&gt; what you guys think.   Has anybody else got good stuff from this panasonic \n&gt; recorder, if so i would love  to hear it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **************Planning your summer road trip?
