&gt;
&gt; I attacked no one.  I attacked no evidence.  I did not give specific

&gt;&gt;&gt; Relax Ursula.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I too have been aware of this at Keith&#x27;s site for long, long time, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; like I said in the last post, I am very new to this as in doing it on my own
&gt;&gt;&gt; computer.  Just like you.  So don&#x27;t act like you know what I do and do not
&gt;&gt;&gt; know, thank you very much.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I am not attacking you so back the hell off.  I made it clear that this
&gt;&gt;&gt; was for my own own edification, for me to accept my own images.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The image I ever so briefly mentioned the one posted that had several
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Faces&quot; or pieces thereof that were circled.  As for your image of the man
&gt;&gt;&gt; peeking out, I saw nothing there.  Period.   Did I say previously what I
&gt;&gt;&gt; thought about the quality of the images in that photo?  No.  I politely kept
&gt;&gt;&gt; it to myself because I do not like to differ with people or to deflate hot
&gt;&gt;&gt; air balloons.  But there you have it, that is what I saw.  And to my
&gt;&gt;&gt; knowledge, that is the only time I have described what I have seen thus far
&gt;&gt;&gt; in your images other than mentioning the word &quot;eyebrows.&quot;  In the one that
&gt;&gt;&gt; had many circles, I saw one that looked like a set of lips and a chin and
&gt;&gt;&gt; the rest I personally thought was matrixing.  Once again, did I saw this?
&gt;&gt;&gt;  No.  But you asked for it so there it is.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The whole point of my post, had you read it with a clear head.  It was
&gt;&gt;&gt; all about my own edification, that I, and I alone, need to keep plugging in
&gt;&gt;&gt; files before I, and I alone, make a judgement about MY images and whether
&gt;&gt;&gt; they are real or not based upon the images they provide in contrast to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; bulk of other files.  If you simply compare your one image with the many
&gt;&gt;&gt; circles to the youtube file, I suspect I am correct in saying that faces
&gt;&gt;&gt; occur with much more rarity than your circle file and that they can appear
&gt;&gt;&gt; fully formed.  Once again, I suspect, only, and I will only be able to tell
&gt;&gt;&gt; after time.  Sample size is everything, and I thought I made that abundantly
&gt;&gt;&gt; clear.  The post was simply about my process of learning rather than running
&gt;&gt;&gt; out and saying look what I found when I simply don&#x27;t know what has been
&gt;&gt;&gt; found yet because it is the first time I have played with the controls
&gt;&gt;&gt; rather than seeing the end snapshots on another persons website.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why do you always jump on the defensive and attack every one who does not
&gt;&gt;&gt; fall in line with you?  Not everything has to be fight or flight, Ursula,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and not every bridge has to be burned so thoroughly to the ground.  This is
&gt;&gt;&gt; not an attack on you or results, reread the post, and this time thinking a
&gt;&gt;&gt; little more clearly about what is written on the page and not your own
&gt;&gt;&gt; emotional backlash construing things in the posted text that are simply not
&gt;&gt;&gt; there.  Had you done this, you would have seen the point of my post was not
&gt;&gt;&gt; an attack on you, in ANY way.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I don&#x27;t think I am being too critical, but I may have expectations
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that are a little too high.  I want to take my time with this.  For my own
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understanding, I need to have a large sample size so I know not only what to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expect to see, but what to look for.  I have seen ITC snapshots from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; programs like this that offer full faces.  I would be more inclined to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe in such an image as opposed to, lets say. two dark lines that may or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may not be eyebrows.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Even in your example of the towel, you get half a face.  If you have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; half a face (on the vertical plane, not the horizontal) you can extrapolate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out what the entire face would look like.  This is something I would like to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get myself and I would consider that evidence if it showed up in one of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these programs.  But, if you have something that looks like a forehead and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is all there is, then it could also look like a rock or some other such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; object.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am certainly hoping for results worked into box sessions.  Directing a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; session with intent, like saying &quot;I am going to examine the sound waves of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this communication in hopes of seeing your face.  Is it possible you can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; show your face to me now through sound? &quot; is what I am after.  If a positive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hit like this happens, then I will be jumping for joy.  Another good example
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be a name, lets say Tom, that occurs.  If you get a positive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; affirmation that the name you heard is present, then you try the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; technique only you address Tom by name and get a face, that would be even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But, as it stands now, the faces as they appear are random at best.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be more inclined to believe that when these faces do occur , they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going to occur with a lesser frequency than multiple images in a few seconds
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of audio like Ursula&#x27;s example.  If this where the case, there would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dozens, and possibly hundreds, of faces during a ten minute session and I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just don&#x27;t think that is possible.  This is why I need to look at several
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; samples to find out if this is the case or not.  If these partialized faces
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; occur in multiples all the time, I would be more apt to discount it.  But,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if they are a rarity affixed to only a few clips out of dozens, I would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more inclined to believe in them.  Sample size is everything.  It is like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; listening to GBC.  If you have never done a session before, you would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inclined to believe every stray radio signal is a communication.  Only by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; continued practice (expanding your sample size) can you start to rule out
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stray radio with any degree of accuracy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the other hand, I am very new to this and I could certainly be wrong.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  I will continue to plug sound into the programs and hope for the best.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I really want this to work.  As you have probably experienced, when they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want you to hear something or know something, they make it very obvious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while communicating.  I am hoping they apply this same rigor to this new
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; format to show us that they are there.  If they can, then the world of video
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and audio ITC will merge in one source and then the skeptics be damned!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    I think it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect every file to have faces and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; images. These faces are often just portions, eyes and lips, some have eye
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brows. Like all of this, not done for proof, it&#x27;s for emotional impact.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have this woman that shows up in towels, always just half the face. Perahps
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you are being too critical? As with all spirit messages, it&#x27;s what it means
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the experiencer that matters. Expecting full faces is like expecting the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kings english and proper grammer in all EVPs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  I saw a couple which could be construed as images in the one series
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you had from SEA, but nothing that knocked me over the head yet.  I am going
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to have to see a larger sample size before I determine if what you have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; witnessed is in fact a form or not.  I cannot accept an image as paranormal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without knowing where it sits among the bulk of audio files.  If every file
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has multiple faces, the I would have  to say that there is nothing there.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I will certainly keep testing with my copy and hopefully something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will really pop for me.  I have run through about ten files (EVP and GBC) so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; far for intensive study and I still haven&#x27;t got anything that I would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consider a positive hit.  I need an actual formed face, not portions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thereof, to consider an image real.  This is the only way to discount visual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; matrixing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have high hopes for this though!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  I&#x27;ve seen live webcast of ITC sessions where GB output is fed directly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into the mic line in on a computer running Adobe Audition with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spectragraph running. It was really compelling to see letters and numbers,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not images or pictures, but partial words appear in the graph. At first it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was I thought it was a software glitch but it is a repeatable event. It was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on LiveSciFi which is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was some kind
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of code error but it happened on more than one webcast.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So if anyone has Audition, just feed Box output right in your computer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and see what happens. I wanted to try it tonight but I have Audacity and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spectragraph feature doesn&#x27;t have that shaded appearance that Audition does
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so it&#x27;s not able to render images or characters, at least as far as I see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using the various settings.

No, I don&#x27; hink I am being oo c i ical, bu I may ha e expec a ions ha a e a li le oo high.  I wan o ake my ime wi h his.  Fo my own unde s anding, I need o ha e a la ge sample size so I know no only wha o expec o see, bu wha o look o .  I ha e seen ITC snapsho s om p og ams like his ha o e ull aces.  I would be mo e inclined o belie e in such an image as opposed o, le s say. wo da k lines ha may o may no be eyeb ows. 

E en in you example o he owel, you ge hal a ace.  I you ha e hal a ace (on he e ical plane, no he ho izon al) you can ex apola e ou wha he en i e ace would look like.  This is some hing I would like o ge mysel and I would conside ha e idence i i showed up in one o hese p og ams.  Bu , i you ha e some hing ha looks like a o ehead and ha is all he e is, hen i could also look like a ock o some o he such objec .


I am ce ainly hoping o esul s wo ked in o box sessions.  Di ec ing a session wi h in en , like saying &quot;I am going o examine he sound wa es o his communica ion in hopes o seeing you ace.  Is i possible you can show you ace o me now h ough sound? &quot; is wha I am a e .  I a posi i e hi like his happens, hen I will be jumping o joy.  Ano he good example would be a name, le s say Tom, ha occu s.  I you ge a posi i e a i ma ion ha he name you hea d is p esen , hen you y he same echnique only you add ess Tom by name and ge a ace, ha would be e en be e .


Bu , as i s ands now, he aces as hey appea a e andom a bes .  I would be mo e inclined o belie e ha when hese aces do occu , hey a e going o occu wi h a lesse equency han mul iple images in a ew seconds o audio like U sula&#x27;s example.  I his whe e he case, he e would be dozens, and possibly hund eds, o aces du ing a en minu e session and I jus don&#x27; hink ha is possible.  This is why I need o look a se e al samples o ind ou i his is he case o no .  I hese pa ialized aces occu in mul iples all he ime, I would be mo e ap o discoun i .  Bu , i hey a e a a i y a ixed o only a ew clips ou o dozens, I would be mo e inclined o belie e in hem.  Sample size is e e y hing.  I is like lis ening o GBC.  I you ha e ne e done a session be o e, you would be inclined o belie e e e y s ay adio signal is a communica ion.  Only by con inued p ac ice (expanding you sample size) can you s a o ule ou s ay adio wi h any deg ee o accu acy.  


On he o he hand, I am e y new o his and I could ce ainly be w ong.  I will con inue o plug sound in o he p og ams and hope o he bes .  

I eally wan his o wo k.  As you ha e p obably expe ienced, when hey wan you o hea some hing o know some hing, hey make i e y ob ious while communica ing.  I am hoping hey apply his same igo o his new o ma o show us ha hey a e he e.  I hey can, hen he wo ld o ideo and audio ITC will me ge in one sou ce and hen he skep ics be damned!

 I hink i &#x27;s un ealis ic o expec e e y ile o ha e aces and images. These aces a e o en jus po ions, eyes and lips, some ha e eye b ows. Like all o his, no done o p oo , i &#x27;s o emo ional impac .  I ha e his woman ha shows up in owels, always jus hal he ace. Pe ahps you a e being oo c i ical? As wi h all spi i messages, i &#x27;s wha i means o he expe ience ha ma e s. Expec ing ull aces is like expec ing he kings english and p ope g amme in all EVPs.

I saw a couple which could be cons ued as images in he one se ies you had om SEA, bu no hing ha knocked me o e he head ye .  I am going o ha e o see a la ge sample size be o e I de e mine i wha you ha e wi nessed is in ac a o m o no .  I canno accep an image as pa ano mal wi hou knowing whe e i si s among he bulk o audio iles.  I e e y ile has mul iple aces, he I would ha e   o say ha he e is no hing he e. 


So, I will ce ainly keep es ing wi h my copy and hope ully some hing will eally pop o me.  I ha e un h ough abou en iles (EVP and GBC) so a o in ensi e s udy and I s ill ha en&#x27; go any hing ha I would conside a posi i e hi .  I need an ac ual o med ace, no po ions he eo , o conside an image eal.  This is he only way o discoun isual ma ixing.


I ha e high hopes o his hough!
