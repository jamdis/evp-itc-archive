Yeah, Juli and Ron, I dont yet have a digital radio, but did try my old 1968 Panasonic ww am/fm radio yesterday, which is manual dial, and I got EVP!!!!!  
   
  Yes, they called my name three times!

            Ron, You have to keep trying!   I know it gets frustrating, but that is what keeps up going!  You will get past the week signal and when you get that 1 awesome session (above all the rest) it will be well worth it.  
   
   
  I thought the very same thing when I started.  I couldn't get enough of the voices, and keep wanting more and more, only not to be able to get the stations and scanning I needed.  I ended up researching for signal strenght, asking Frank and the others for help, and hear I am now.  
   
  Its the hurdles we climb, but once we make it to the top......WHOOO what sweet success!

      Just found this about your new box.  Looks and sounds promising.  But I suppose in my Land-of-Weak-Signals I would get nothing.  On the other hand, I almost feel I would sacrafice a volume of sessions and signals for good, clear, multi-word messages.  I am getting EVP block because I am afraid I will get nothing during a session or, worse yet, I may be getting messages but I cannot hear or understand them...if you get my drift.  Good stuff at your end.  Ron L

I am testing that scans to strong signals only on the FM band, with 
scan rate and range adjustments. This method is different sounding, 
being somewhat choppy, but may yield clearer audio. The downside, as I 
have been discussing elsewhere, may be the lack of weaker signals 
between, and less white noise to be utilized. I'll keep working with 
it and post my results as I have them. If spirits can manipulate 
audio, then this method may have merit, too. ;)
