I watched some of it.  Maybe I missed something, but it seemed whenever Chris Moon used that box, whatever I heard was nothing like what he interpreted it as saying.  Did anyone else get more out of those sessions than I did?  I have to believe that if there were any better results, they would have highlighted those on the show.  By not showing better results (again, in my opinion), the whole point of including Chris Moon&#x27;s sessions can only be seen, at best, as entertainment.  And with a family in stress, that seems, again at best, as inappropriate.

I have to admit that I thought I had seen the worst &#x27;paranormal&#x27; show on television already. I was wrong. Door to the Dead has exceeded my worst expectations.
 
Generally, I respect John Oliver&#x27;s work as a medium. While I have no personal experience with him, in the past he has looked and acted more genuine than not, the rolling of the eyes put aside for the moment.
 
I do take exception to the characterization of the talking box as an Edison device. I have documented the history of Edison, ITC and EVP  elsewhere. This is however the smallest concern I have with this show.
 
Prior to wathcing I had just had a conversation with a respected colleague on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena he and others are constantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to that on Door to the Dead. None of those measurements were made by this team. The use of thermal in this situation is not indicated as well.
 
The real concern is that no attempt was made to help this family in a broader context. The skeptic did and said nothing skeptical as far as I could tell. Key questions were not asked (at least on-camera) that would reveal the psycho-dynamics of this family. We know fairly well at this time that PK phenomena is often centered on a focal person who can exhibit specific characteristics. That the team seems unaware of this is quite disturbing to a person like myself.
 
A real research opportunity was lost in this case, as was an opportunity to educate the public on the right way to approach such situations. Continually sending the messages that phenomena is based on &#x27;demons&#x27; and &#x27;spirits&#x27; exclusively does nothing to further the position of serious investigators, which is perhaps most troubling of all.
