This time my recorder was acting up (DR60). The REC led indicator would flash sometimes (supposed to remain steady) and I would notice that the timer would stay in place for sometimes 5 seconds before it would change up one number....I though I had broken it somehow. I did hear lots of LOUD splatter noises on playback while in the field. My battery indicator showed 2 of 3 bars, but I went in to town and got fresh AAA&#39;s anyway. I then went to water trough and the flashing still happened for 2 recordings here. I then said for the &quot;bad guy&quot; to leave and stop messing with my recorder. Well then on my 3rd attempt....recorder started working fine. After I finished the 3rd recording I packed up and went to the fairgrounds (just a spur of the moment) *I thought.....so at fairgrounds I recorded for a little over 10 minutes (I stopped at an old -church/school/courthouse- (single room log cabin-multiple uses back then) that was used in Debuke Iowa during 1823 (think was date). And I also asked questions around 2 other reconstructed buildings from long ago. Well I got home....when my recorder was acting up in country I find a Male evp say &quot;Get Out Of My Face&quot;. I think he was guy messing with my recorder........Then while at the water trough (recorder still acting up even with 2 new batteries) I finally get it to work (after telling what I think followed me &quot;to leave&quot;). At the end of my last recording (the good one) from this water trough, I hear a little girl say &quot;come to the fair....someone said&quot; ***So I didn&#39;t go to the fairgrounds uninvited*** I just decided to go for know reason I had guessed. Well what I am so &quot;disturbed&quot; about now.........is that while I was playing these other recordings I ACCIDENTALLY-ERASED my 10 plus minutes of recording from fairgrounds BEFORE I even got a chance to listen or download it. OOOoooowwww!!! :) Makes me mad. No telling what could have been on there. I was INVITED&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shucks!! I will upload the &quot;get out of my face&quot; as the little girl is way to quite to hear. The guy is not so quite-but is still LOW audio. I don&#39;t want him playing with my recorder anymore :/"}
