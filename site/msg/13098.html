Not being an electronics guy... I guess slight modification(s) could solve =
the "problem" however, in doing so (and again I'm not an electronics guy) w=
ouldn't modifications solve one problem but affect the units ability to rec=

P.S. I've always used Sony recorders. Cur=

)...

I'm "old school" in that I like to also use microcassette recorde=

I'm guessing from my experience=

are sensitive to RF. Possibly som=
