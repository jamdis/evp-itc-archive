To greatly simplify things, motions within motions in and of \nspace (or spacetime, if you will) cohese to form larger patterns we call \nenergy.  Energy coheses and condenses to form denser patterns we call \nmatter or mass.\n\nCondensed space becomes energy. Dispersed matter becomes energy. There are \nmany ways of accomplishing this.\n\nAll that article is describing is the patterns.  It doesn&#39;t mention the \ncontent or structure of the patterns.\n\nAlso, the last sentence of the article is not completely true.  I&#39;m sure \nFrank and a few others around who are radio amateurs or are familiar with \nthe phenomena of propagation know about things like sporadic-E clouds and \ntropospheric ducting which enable signals in the FM spectrum (88 to 108 \nMHz) and even higher frequencies to propagate long distances.  I made a \nmicrowave radio contact over a 470 mile path on the frequency of 10368 \nMHz (microwave) with 2 watts and a small (20-inch) dish antenna a few \nweeks ago. Something called &quot;knife-edge diffraction&quot; is also fun to play \nwith, where the radio signals can be made to diffract over the tops of \nbuildings and mountains for long-distance contacts. We&#39;ve had lots of fun \nwith this over the tops of Chicago skyscrapers in the past, too.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Mon, 18 Aug 2008, black bear hollow wrote:\n\n&gt; Is it?\n&gt; http://library.thinkquest.org/C005705/English/Light/light1.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; w.\n&gt; On Aug 18, 2008, at 12:27 PM, threadsintyme@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Light is energy.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Al\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;"}
