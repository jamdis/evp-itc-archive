<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Al,

Yes, I&#x27;m pretty sure it came from the ion lamp as it sparked and sent 
its bolts all around the glass.  It shocked me that the device 
detected so much. At first I thought it was speaking, as it sounds 
like some sort of speech and the waves were actually good sine 
configurations.
I will have to play around with the audio file and see if speed 
adjustment brings out anything, as you suggested.
Wouldn&#x27;t that be cool if entities were using this as a form of 
communication...

Thanks,
- Mike (UFO Geek)

&gt; Mike,
&gt; You did indeed, pick up energy. Is this energy &quot;intelligent 
energy&quot;, IE, did the energy carry any sign of intelligent 
communication? 
&gt; Is there any way to try to slow the recording down; or, modulating 
the recording to see if there&#x27;s any intelligent communication?
&gt; The energy that you were picking up...could it have originated form 
the Ion lamp?
&gt; Thanks for a great experiment!
&gt; Al

&gt; Well, I did some testing of the device this evening... and wow! It 
&gt; worked better than I thought it would.
&gt; It&#x27;s not a microphone but it picks up energy in the area and 
produces 
&gt; waveforms.
&gt; I&#x27;ve produced a short video showing a demonstration of what it 
&gt; captured in two modes. You can see that video, here:

&gt; &gt; My prototype design of an EVP capture device using diodes, coils,
&gt; &gt; resistors. This allows for the capture of EVP without a 
microphone.
&gt; &gt; Plugs into a tape recorder, digital recorder, or computer. 
Similar 
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; the Raudive diode device used in the 1970&#x27;s.

&gt; &gt; Now... on with a few tests.
