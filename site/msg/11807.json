This seems to be an entity  \n&gt; collective who enjoy teasing EVP researchers. They caused a lot of  \n&gt; annoyance to other researchers in the past, but nothing serious.  \n&gt; Some seemed to be afraid of them, but I never really heard of them  \n&gt; doing anymore than being annoying and prankish and sometimes, well,  \n&gt; actually pretty damned funny on occasion.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;\n&gt; On Aug 17, 2008, at 12:42 PM, Pridegrl Neverumind wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; i have tried looking online for more info about these nefarious  \n&gt;&gt; fish-ppl.... anyone have a link to info?\n&gt;&gt; thanks\n&gt;&gt; Charm\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- On Sun, 8/17/08, Lisby &lt;lisby@earthlink. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; From: Lisby &lt;lisby@earthlink. net&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Ahhh the infamous Fish!\n&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;&gt; Received: Sunday, August 17, 2008, 8:39 AM\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Shit, Frank--I got one the other day that I haven&#39;t even pulled as  \n&gt;&gt; a clip yet that says, &quot;Believe in the fish.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Great.

Just when you think you&#39;re  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; getting great evidiecne and proo, it turns out to be these tricky  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; jokers. Another reason not to take everything a gospel truth.  I  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; think it was thoise researchers in Luxemberg(?) that first got  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; these guys, but I don&#39;t remeber for sure. So if you hear any  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; reference to fish, that&#39;s a clue that they are there.
