What? How's that?

To most people listening to the even the files posted he=
re, it is just radio gibberish, or they hear their own thing, until someone=
 else tells them what they hear. Science would call it pareidolia, nothing =
more.

  If other people could not hear the voices then the=
 files would not be posted here. There are at least THREE things going on. =
1) SOme voices are REAL and "impressed" upon the sound carrier. These can b=
e heard by everyone. 2) In some cases the "impression" is not as "clean" an=
d one has to develop "an ear" so to speak, to hear them (like sea legs, but=
 for EVP) 3)the sound forms an enabling "random feild" in the head of the l=
istener which makes him psychically open to the voices of the spirits direc=
tly.
