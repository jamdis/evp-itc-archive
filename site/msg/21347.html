&gt; you know what I keep my mind open to anything - after discovering the ghost box I starting to believe that nothing is impossible - but since I don&#x27;t know who caused what, I don&#x27;t know what to believe... right now I&#x27;m more concerned about all the radiation flying around everywhere... all the milk and crops growing everywhere have high radiation in it right now...  i don&#x27;t drink milk cause i&#x27;m vegan but i&#x27;m wanting to not eat salad anymore, and just stick to rice and beans and spaghetti peanut butter and crackers for a while....  our world is one f-ed up mess.
&gt; 
&gt; You know what would be terrifying, to be right in front of that bolt of lighting when it goes off (the beginning scene in the video).... one time it was storming outside and we were stuck in slowmoving traffic right when a powerline blew up right behind us and the fire from it was traveling towards our car along the powerline and we were moving too slow and I was like &quot;Drive Dave drive!!!&quot;  omg that was so scary...
