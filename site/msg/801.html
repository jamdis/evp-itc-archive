<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have so many e-mails coming in I can&#x27;t even see straight anymore!
the only way to test that &quot;30 souls&quot; is get aobut 60 boxes out there(or 
maybe 31), and see if they work.

&gt;           Chris actually said that he was told that only 30 people in our
&gt;country could use the box. I agree with what you are saying. That
&gt;makes sense. I&#x27;m just relating what we were told on Saturday by
&gt;Chris Moon.

&gt; &gt; i think that hes talking about, like EVP, where some people
&gt;automatically get messages and others NEVER get em.

&gt;That would be awesome, but Chris said not everyone would be able to
&gt;use
&gt; &gt; them? Is that true, Frank, that only certain people were supposed
&gt;to
&gt; &gt; be able to use the boxes?

&gt; &gt; &gt; you know frank, maybe making these boxes will be your FT calling.
&gt;I
&gt; &gt; bet that if you started looking for partners and financial backing
&gt;that
&gt; &gt; people would come out of the woodwork to back you. Putting these
&gt;into
&gt; &gt; production might be a good thing. Not to mention the people that
&gt;would
&gt; &gt; colaborate to help out with any design flaws.
&gt; &gt; &gt; just a thought.
