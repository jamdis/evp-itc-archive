<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Here is what I experienced just recently.  We were at a fairly famous
investigation spot.  The group before us were &quot;releasing&quot; the spirits. 
Funny how we got soooo many evp&#x27;s just a few minutes after the spirits
were &quot;helped&quot; by this group.  Leads me to feel that we are just making
ourselves feel good about ourselves for &quot;helping&quot; them over.  I don&#x27;t
think we can help a lot of those spirits.  They are there for a
reason...they need to work out some sort of karma...and when that
happens...they can continue.

I&#x27;m just saying,
Carol B.









&gt; Well, everything is done for a reason, I believe this gift of
&gt; communication
&gt;  has been given to us for a reason, not just to sell tickets, but to help
&gt; ourselves still in the world, by moving those other&#x27;s on, we in a sense
&gt; move ourselves on to better and higher vibration.

&gt; We all have our own beliefs. I make no judgements on the living or the
&gt; dead. I just communicate and record. I am an Empath, not a priest.
&gt; Many,many
&gt; spirits have asked me for help. If they can help themselves, they do not
&gt; seem
&gt;  to know how. The prisoners believe that they would be trapped. if they
&gt; died  there. Are they imprisoned by their own beliefs?

&gt;
&gt; In a way, I agree. &quot;Stuck&quot; implies  accidental. If a ghost is hanging
&gt; around, it there by choice, whether it is  fully aware of that or not.

&gt; I don&#x27;t believe in trapped/lost souls, I think that&#x27;s  Hollywood. The
&gt; trouble with doing investigations, I think, is you get  the evidence you
&gt; expect
&gt; to get, so it will tend to support the concept of  stuck souls. When I
&gt; record
&gt; it supports my concept of sprits travel, and  hauntings are for show.
&gt; Which
&gt; is correct?--both at one time or another.
&gt;
&gt; I did a recording at lunch time, at home, and in it a voice says
&gt; &quot;ghost--right behind you&quot;. I was recording open air with the test board
&gt; running.

&gt; Well, stand outside the thing, and help  those poor souls out, here they
&gt; are making money at the cost of lost souls  who are asking for help.
&gt; Shame on
&gt; them, don&#x27;t they realize  how  many lost souls there are out there,
&gt; waiting, go back (a few thousand  years worth of them,)  were I to name
&gt; all the
&gt; tribes, country,  religions, throughout the years, people that died
&gt; trapped, in
&gt; various  places over century&#x27;s, and yes there are thousand&#x27;s of them in
&gt; the
&gt; world,  just dwelling in a cell of their own making, no progression, no
&gt; light, no  hope, without people they love, and who wait still loving them,
&gt; they
&gt;  exist in these dark places without God.  This mission should be to  help
&gt; them get back to God, back to the light of God, light of Universe
&gt; however,
&gt; we want to call it, but in that light is love and  happiness.  Just my
&gt; take,

&gt; Yes, you need special permission. I was there for an all night  ghost hunt
&gt; as a guest of Eastern Paranormal. The place can be rented at  night but
&gt; believe me when I say &quot;it ain&#x27;t cheap&quot;. Plus I don&#x27;t think the  prison
&gt; would
&gt; appreciate me releasing the inmates before their  eternal sentence has
&gt; been
&gt; served..

&gt;
&gt; Does one need special permission to get in  there?  You folks should go
&gt; back, and release them since a few of  them already know you Steve, this
&gt; is
&gt; Steve?  Right?   sf

&gt; Unfortunately I did not get to attempt to cross them. After my
&gt; demonstration, another group that was also there started complaining  that
&gt; the box made
&gt; too much noise and was hendering their investigation  so I turned it off.
&gt; I
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t want my direct communication with  the deceased inmates to mess
&gt; up
&gt; their EVP work, now would I? I  apoligized and put it away for the rest of
&gt; the night.
&gt;  According to the prison staff, the inmates firmly believed  that if they
&gt; died in prison their souls would be forever trapped  there. This belief
&gt; was
&gt; so strong that the prison officials would take  the elderly inmates who
&gt; were
&gt; dying of natural causes  to a local hospital so they would&#x27;nt have to die
&gt; in
&gt; the  prison. Maybe their beliefs were well founded.

&gt;
&gt; This is a wonderful recording, were  you able to free any of them?  So sad
&gt; to see them still there  behind bars, must be very lonely for them, they
&gt; should be moving on  so, they can start to work on making up for things on
&gt; the
&gt; other  side.  You folks should go up there again, and hold a small  prayer
&gt; vigil for them, of course they would no longer be ghosts  trapped there,
&gt; but
&gt; there are plenty more around.  sf

&gt; I was invited to spend the night in the West Virginia  Penitentiary this
&gt; past weekend... I was asked to give a short  demonstration with my Optimus
&gt; 12-797 hacked radio. Deep inside the  prison surrounded by concrete and
&gt; steel,
&gt; the radio could not pick up  any radio stations in manual mode. I wasn&#x27;t
&gt; sure how this might  effect the demonstration. I was pleasantly surprised
&gt; with
&gt; the  results. I recorded the session and the results can be heard at this
&gt; link. _http://www.youtube. com/watch?  v=KwDYu4RULlk_
