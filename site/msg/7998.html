 This is the LA1135 based radio/box. Yeah, that's a store bought cabinet/b=
ox from Radio Shack. It's also with, or without sound chamber--with corespo=
nding line out puts. No tone mod yet, I'm not sure this one needs it. I mad=
e this board back in January, but just now gotting around to boxing it. Thi=
s test was without a sound chamber, or direct mode. Plugging in an external=
 speaker swtiches mode automatically--sorta kinda. I light blasted it again=
--sorry. Oh yeah, range and center controls for more better tuning control/=
experiments. 
 
 Probably shouldn't make it sound too good--oh wait, it's r=
eally crappy, no sound, ghosts hate it--yeah-yeah-that's it!!
