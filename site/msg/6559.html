<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Ron!  I&#x27;ve had better results thus far with the 20-125 than I
have the older 12-469.  But, like Steve says, the AM seems to sweep
slower than the FM on the 20-125.  I have not done a session with the
FM yet, but will soon.

&gt; I just had a Select A Tenna delivered to me in Mexico by a friend. 
Unfortunately this one functions by dialing in the channel you want so
it isn&#x27;t functioning in a way that can be used with a scanning EVP
setup.  I think a non dialer is available with the same company and
that is what I ordered but I need to go back in a check.  Another $60
down.  I hope to use it to get Coast to Coast from San Antonio so it
isn&#x27;t all lost.   
&gt;    
&gt;   Jeremy   I listened to your posts and you got some great captures
there.  I am encouraged because Mike is sending me a RS 125 for me to
pick up in San Diego next month.  Sounds a lot better than my 469.   Ron L

&gt;           I&#x27;ve heard of something called AM DXing. Not that familiar
with it
&gt; though. Somehow you are supposed to be able to boost your signal
&gt; without any external device such as a Select-A-Tenna. I need to read
&gt; into it further. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am very seriously considering buying a Select-A-Tenna.

&gt; &gt; I understand that sun interference would affect the day signal and a
&gt; big factor is radio stations in the u.s. can boost their signal
&gt; strength in later hours. Might be urban legend.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Quite a few researchers get better reception at night.
&gt; &gt; I believe that is due to the fact that less signal traffic 
&gt; &gt; generally at night than during the day. consiquently that will 
&gt; &gt; allow for the weaker signals to be picked up.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Bruce, I will definitely ask about the name Tim and about a
&gt; tech. The
&gt; &gt; &quot;very bored&quot; part, at least if I&#x27;m hearing it correctly, proceeds as
&gt; &gt; soon and the name &quot;Tim&quot; is ending and is at a lot lower decibel level.
&gt; &gt; Could be one of those things meant for me to hear, as in I was boring
&gt; &gt; them. It&#x27;s any body&#x27;s guess.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I got better reception as I did the session at around 8:45pm. 
&gt; &gt; Nighttime seems better for reception around here.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I hear the &quot; TIM&quot; very clearly but not the &quot; VERY BORED&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tim may be your assigned technition, next session ask for
&gt; &gt; conformation about
&gt; &gt; &gt; a permanant tech and who Tim is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now that I&#x27;ve listened to it some more, I think I hear more stuff,
&gt; &gt; butI&#x27;m not sure what. Maybe &quot;Tim&quot; right after I ask to repeat then
&gt; &gt; the&quot;very bored&quot; and something else. Any opinions?Jeremy--- In
