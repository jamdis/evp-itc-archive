Hi, List Members,
 
I've had these two photo's for a very long  time, and thought you all would 
like to see them as they are really great,  and they are both real.   I 
knew when these were taken, and I  have the originals put safely away.
 
This first one was taken in 1984 it belonged to  a Church lady friend, Lio 
Wendell  she was on a tour group to Carlo, Egypt,  at the time there were 22 
people standing in the door way of this little Coptic  Chapel, there were 
no statues nor mirrors in the room, just a tiny small window  in the back of 
the room, and a small Prayer area in the center of the tiny  room.  The man 
in the white shirt was a retired State Dept Emp. it was his  camera used to 
take this shot, the man in black just seen on the other side was  a Coptic 
Priest, what's ironic is this small Chapel is surrounded by Muslim  Temples, 
some people see her, Mary, other's cannot.  She seem's to be  visiting this 
area of the world for several years on and off now,  you are  all welcome to 
take a copy of her picture,  I'm sure she would want that,  so enjoy.
 
The next photo, a black and white Kodak   moment it was taken back in 1938 
by two little elderly lady's, they lived in  Pontiac MI, next door to my 
grandma, they were afraid after developing this  because when they did, they 
saw the Big JC in the photo, again some can't see  him, other's can right 
away.  They were outside taking a picture of the  garden, there were no statues 
in the yard, just them along with grandma,  and the real of photo's were 
developed some time later, but it  got pushed around a bit.   I guess everyone 
was afraid of JC or  something, one of the lady's grand daughter's was 
attending CMU at the time, and  she loaned it to her friend for of all things, a 
witch craft  class!   It then it some how just disappeared ending up at  
another's person's home, a place where the friend never visited, it was on  
loan to her friend as the story goes, guess He didn't want any part of the 
witch  craft class. <g>
 
After years it was thought to have been lost in  a fire, but some how 
someone managed to safe it, anyway, in 1962 Dave  Burton at CMU  a wedding 
photographer managed to duplicate the very old  original, from 1938 up until that 
time everyone thought it could not be  duplicated, but he did, and it was 
put in several local Newspaper's in the  60's, David B. from MT Pleasant, MI,  
died in an accident not far from his  home, a few years ago,  but his widow 
is still living.   I spoke with her not long ago, just to ask how many 
photos he managed to  duplicate,  and she told me he made about 4 or 5 and just 
past them  out a couple of people.   This was back in the late  60's though, 
so she vaguely  recalled the whole  incident .
 
Well, now once and awhile these photos will  come up on Ebay from people in 
China, lol where they claim they took the  picture there of the clouds, lol 
 another time, I found someone  selling a paper copy on Ebay  for several 
thousand dollars!  And they  claim to say it was taken in snow by a friend or 
whatever, once I saw an ad  running from some lady in IA, in the Midwest, 
she was trying to sell it too,  and claiming to have her friend take it of 
snow in a bush or something or  other, until I called and told her where it 
really came from, and to please take  it down, because she only had a copy on 
a piece of paper she was trying to sell  for 3 Grand, I told her that it 
belonged to my family, and that it was not to be  sold.  But, if she wished she 
could give paper copy's away to  people,  
 
It seems that once they find out the truth  of how it really came to be, 
they take them down pronto.  I have  the original, here put away, and I have a 
duplicate dated from 62,  they  are very old.   And are turning yellow now, 
 I have them put in  glass, inside a suit case, near a Bible, both 
picture's are stored, but I  also have them on my PC  to send out to anyone that 
wants one...I  don't trust to take them any where for fear of it getting them 
damaged or  stolen.  These picture's are a real blessing, how good to have 
this  wonderful knowledge, knowing He, Jesus is Real!  So, I give these to all 
of  you, may they be a blessing to your endeavors to create this better 
this  communication for the future of us all.  God Bless you all,  sf
