<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, you have just terribly upset me by mentioning Harmony. Now all  
possibility of Harmony is off the table. I&#x27;m calling the Forces of  
Darkness to serve you a false communication burger with extra cheese.

I really gotta know who this is now.

&gt;  This is the whole point I was trying to make, all you need is  
&gt; something for them to form a voice with, and there wil be no  
&gt; shortage of entites that want to talk.
&gt;
&gt;  I had bit of temper yesteraday, as a long time researcher accused  
&gt; all of us of getting &quot;false communication&quot;. Maybe I&#x27;m in bitch  
&gt; mode, but that crap really pisses me off. Who the hell is this one  
&gt; guy to assume everything he gets is gospel truth(that no one else  
&gt; can hear), while we get nothing. Still trying to calm myself so as  
&gt; not to upset the &quot;harmony&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;  Well done everyone!!

&gt; &gt; Bruce I tend to agree with on everything you just stated. I cherish
&gt; my
&gt; &gt; FB and even though I must choose the location carefully with it it&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; the messages that come through that make it profound. But the Shack
&gt; &gt; Hack is an important development, the timing of it is ironic
&gt; &gt; considering other recent Box developments.

&gt; &gt; &gt; HEY GUY&#x27;S
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; OF COURSE I HAVE MY RS HACK AND GETTING RESULTS THE FIRST DAY.
&gt; &gt; &gt; MY INITIAL OPINION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS LITTLE GEM IS FROM
&gt; TWO
&gt; &gt; &gt; EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS ONE PERFORMED BY STEVE HULTAY AND MYSELF
&gt; AND
&gt; &gt; &gt; THE OTHER BY MYSELF ALONE. THE FILES I HAVE POSTED ARE GLEENED
&gt; FROM
&gt; &gt; &gt; ONLY THE FIRST MINUTE OR SO OF A TEN MINUTE RECORDING.PLEASE TAKE
&gt; A
&gt; &gt; &gt; MINUTE TO LISTEN AND POST YOUR FEEDBACK.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; THE FILES ARE POSTED IN THE FILE SECTION UNDER:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 11-26-07_radio shack hack files_Bruce
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; AFTER DOING ONLY ONE RECORDED SESSION AND TWO SESSIONS TOTAL. I
&gt; AS A
&gt; &gt; &gt; SERIOUS BOX RESEARCHER WITH EVRYDAY EXPERIMENTING ON
&gt; FRANK&#x27;S,JOE&#x27;S
&gt; &gt; &gt; AND NOW THE RADIO SHACK HACK BOX CAN PREMATURELY SAY THAT THIS
&gt; RADIO
&gt; &gt; &gt; MAY BE SMALL IN SIZE BUT IT PACKS A BIG PUNCH ! AND IT WAS UNDER
&gt; OUR
&gt; &gt; &gt; VERY NOSES ALL THE TIME. THANKS TO SUM DUC FOR HIS INSIGHT IN
&gt; &gt; &gt; DISCOVERING IT.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING REDUNDENT I MUST REITERATE THIS RS BOX
&gt; WILL
&gt; &gt; &gt; HOLD IT&#x27;S OWN WITH THE BIG BOYS. THE RESULTS AND LEVEL OF
&gt; &gt; &gt; COMMUNICATION BOTH IN REAL TIME DURING A SESSION AND WHAT IS
&gt; MISSED
&gt; &gt; &gt; BY OUR RUDIMENTARY HUMAN HEARING AND CAUGHT ON A RECORDING RIVALS
&gt; OR
&gt; &gt; &gt; MAY EVEN GIVEN ENOUGH TIME FOR FREQUENCY IMPRINTING BY OUR SPIRIT
&gt; &gt; &gt; FRIENDS AND PROPER RESEARCH METHODS WILL SURPASS JOE&#x27;S BOX AND
&gt; PULL A
&gt; &gt; &gt; CLOSE SECOND TO FRANK&#x27;S BOX.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE RS BOX WAS
&gt; REMINICENT
&gt; &gt; &gt; OF THE AM LINEAR MODE OF MY FRANKS BOX #12. LET&#x27;S FACE IT A
&gt; FRANKS
&gt; &gt; &gt; BOX IS A FRANKS BOX IN AS NO TWO ARE EXACTLY THE SAME THAT IS
&gt; WHAT
&gt; &gt; &gt; MAKES THEM SO UNIQUE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT I BELIEVE A SMALL
&gt; PART OF
&gt; &gt; &gt; FRANK HIMSELF TRANSFERS INTO EVERY BOX HE MAKES AND HE IS VERY
&gt; WELL
&gt; &gt; &gt; RESPECTED ON THE OTHER SIDE FROM WHAT MY GUIDES AND TECHS TELL ME.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE RON RICKETS MINI BOX YET
&gt; BUT I
&gt; &gt; &gt; AM HEARING VERY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT&#x27;S PERFORMANCE ALSO AND CAN
&gt; NOT
&gt; &gt; &gt; WAIT TO EXPERIMENT WITH IT.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I THINK OUR FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE FINALY DECIDING TO PUSH
&gt; &gt; &gt; FORWARD WITH THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS AND ALLOW IT TO BECOME
&gt; &gt; &gt; ACCESABLE TO MANY MORE PEOPLE. WHAT THEY HAVE CONVEYED TO ME OVER
&gt; &gt; &gt; NUMEROUS SESSIONS IS THE DESPERATE AND INTRIGAL NEED FOR COMBINED
&gt; &gt; &gt; HARMONY AMONG RESEARCHERS AND COMMUNICATORS. THE MORE MINDS THAT
&gt; ARE
&gt; &gt; &gt; THINKING AND MOVING TOGETHER FOR THIS COMMON GOAL THE STRONGER
&gt; THE
&gt; &gt; &gt; SPIRITS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE AND THEY WILL HELP WITH DEVELOPE
&gt; MENT
&gt; &gt; &gt; OF THE TECHNOLOGY SO THINGS ARE LOOKING UP AND HEADING TO THE
&gt; FUTURE.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; WHAT I HAVE GATHERED OVER MANY SESSIONS IS THEY DEFINATELY WANT
&gt; THE
&gt; &gt; &gt; WORD AND THE TECHNOLOGY SPREAD TO AS MANY AS ARE WILLING TO
&gt; ACCEPT IT
&gt; &gt; &gt; WITH AN OPEN MIND. I AM RATTLING ON AND HAVE DRIFTED FROM MY
&gt; ORIGINAL
&gt; &gt; &gt; POINT WHICH WAS, THIS RADIO SHACK BOX IS AND WILL BE A VERY
&gt; IMPORTANT
&gt; &gt; &gt; AND USEFULL TOOL IN FURTHERING OUR COMMUNICATION PROCESS.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; THANKS FOR LISTENING.
