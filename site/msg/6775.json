I took Steve&#39;s comment as yet \nsomeone else telling me how the boxes really work. \n\n I don&#39;t &quot;run&quot; any sessions with the boxes, or any other method, I \nlet whatever comes-come, no prejudging, or biasing by asking \nquestions, nor asking for guides, technicians, or Jesus! It is \nexceeingly frustrating that no one will try that approach--just let \nthe damn sprits/entities talk and not try to second guess all of it, \nas if any of us are wise enough to ask anything intelligent. I can \nonly guess at how much is missed. \n\n Just as today, one of our litle dogs, Winston, aka Littlebit lifted \nhis leg on an end table, and just at that second &quot;Littlebit&quot; came \nfrom the tape I was listening to from last night&#39;s testing. Y&#39;all are \nso busy getting the &quot;Evidence&quot;, and doing talk shows, appearances, \nand trying second guess spirit that you miss the truely interesting \naspects of this work! \n\n Frank"}
