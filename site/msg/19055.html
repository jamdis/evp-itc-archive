<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>On C2C the other night Noory mentioned a town in China that seemingly
disappeared,  I was asking what happend to it, and in this video at 4
seconds &quot;the town went down&quot;. this is random mode. That&#x27;s the problem, I
hear this stuff different all the time, and which hearing is the correct
one, or is there a correct one?

 At 11 seconds &quot;what is the Earth--What is doom&quot; wierd., and &quot;German
hostage&quot; at the end.

 This one going to Rolling Hills too.
