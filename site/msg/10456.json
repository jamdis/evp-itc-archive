This is my\nsecond post since joining the group\non March 1.\n\nI came here specifically to listen and learn from Frank Sumption and to\nlikeminded individuals.  I am a ham radio operator,\nalthough I have not been active in years since the CB&#39;ers kind of took over\nwith their new no-code rules, and am a\ncomputer technician.  I have been passionately pursuing paranormal interests\nsince I was a child.  So, Frank, please\nkeep on supplying us with your knowledge and foresight.  I look forward to\nyour posts; and I read all of them.\n\nI read all the posts, even by the guy with the gall to ask for someone to\nsend him a radio.  Yes, I would give anything\nto have one; but I would not dare ask someone to do that for me.  That&#39;s\njust wrong!  And as far as threatening\npersonal emails, what the Hell has been the matter with people?  My wife is\nthe business manager of a local\npsychiatric practice.  The day of the full moon, they had more patients and\nadmitted more people to the psychiatric\nwing of the hospital than ever!\n\nThis is off-topic.  I have been dealing with a personal problem for the past\nseveral weeks.  I had a chest X-ray; and\non it they found a 2.5 cm nodule in one of my lungs.  My catscan is May 8th\nto make sure I do not have lung cancer.\nThe waiting is killing me.  It&#39;s like being on death row and waiting to see\nif the phone rings.  So, I have not had the\nenergy to do anything lately.  I am only waiting...\n\nHopefully, there will be a positive outcome, and then I can delve into this\nfurther and begin some research of my own.\n\nFrank, please stick around.\n\nWes\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0366_01C8A5EF.EBC40CC0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html;
