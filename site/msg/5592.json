They like to call me &quot;one point&quot; alot as well as by my given names. I am just &quot;one point&quot; of many that are on the bridge. \n   \n  They talk alot about merges, connecting to me and those around them. Often they speak with one voice or one starts and others continue the sentence. When I first started it was very multilayer, everyone talking at once trying to say hi or yelling over one another. \n   \n  Later I asked they speak one at a time, in one voice so that it is easier for me to comprehend what is being said by each voice. In return I agreed no smoking when I record or do sessions because they were always coughing and hacking and complaining about it LOL\n   \n  Worked out pretty well. They do still multilayer but for water method a voice at normal speed and the same recording slowed down -74 and containing numerous entities speaking...one at a time for the most part. There is a bit of orderly chaos, often I hear them being told it is thier turn to speak now or being given in depth directions for how to speak. A few are told/reminded of the form of the throat, mouth, vocals and equipment they need to speak. Some need no help. Some say they never were alive/dead/human. \n   \n  When I get there I will have a pretty good idea how to say howdy to a few of you folks LOL maybe even try out that thing where they speak directly into your ear and make you jump up after just laying down to turn the light on and see whos in the room talking. Maybe help you find some lost items. Maybe write you a note on that shower window LOL. (havent experienced last one cuz I tore out that shower door years ago hehehe)...who knows. definitely poke a few bears while I am at it and open a few eyes to whats around them.\n   \n  Perhaps I differ from many in that I have so many on the other side that I formed tight bonds with and joked with about coming back after we die to contact/haunt people. They kept thier promise. Many may know the loss of someone close to them... Ive experienced the loss of dozens. It is &quot;our&quot; feeling of loss. I have come to learn that I dont grieve for those who pass, I grieve for myself and my own feeling of loss. I am happy for them usually unless its a life taken, or too short lived.\n   \n  They have spoken of past &quot;times&quot; past experiences I (never) had. But they also talk about alternate dimensions and the whole quantum thing starts to kick in and starts to boggle my brain a bit.\n   \n  Do they know you??? ..oh yes I think perhaps many of them know more about you than you know about yourself. They will tell you details about you, those you know, those you never met, those you may meet in the future.. maybe even some alternate universe or higher self details. \n   \n  It&#39;s all quite interesting. Sometimes they go too far above my head or my googling capabilities LOL but I just save it and move on and maybe it will make sense at a later date when/if I catch up to what they are saying.\n   \n  One thing you will find yourself beginning to say quite often is... &quot;what a coincidence...or is it&quot;.\n   \n  Misty\n\nJules &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; wrote:\n          I was thinking tonight as Frank S. welcomed some of our new comers to \nthe group if in fact anyone during a box session inquired to the names \nin which the other side call us?\n\nFor instance Frank has been addressed as princess, and I know I have \ngotten a spirit stating he was my brother (I am an only child).
