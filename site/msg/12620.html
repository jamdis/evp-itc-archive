&gt; Sorry Anna, I sent a reply to this twice but my email has not yet
been posted for the group. Not sure what&#x27;s up. This is another test
and I will wait to see if the previous message comes through before I
resend. ron

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Everyone!
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m new and I stumbled onto this group after doing some research
&gt; online into EVP. I consider myself to be a paranormal skeptic, but I
&gt; have heard some very interesting EVP evidence and would like to look
&gt; into it further. I joined this group because I am interested in
&gt; submitting EVP data to some rigorous scientific analysis. I&#x27;m an
&gt; electrical engineer and mainly work in the areas of signal processing
&gt; and communications so all of this is extremely interesting. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am interested in collecting some of my own data (at some point) by
&gt; building a ghost box based on Frank Sumption&#x27;s designs. I am working
&gt; from the &quot;Ghost Box Notebook&quot; from 2007, but I am having a hard time
&gt; getting started. Has anyone built one of these and are there any
&gt; parts lists or more complete schematics floating around? I would
&gt; appreciate any build help or advice any of you might have.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Anna
