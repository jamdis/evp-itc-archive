Don't forget that batteries tend to drain quickly in cold locations.  Also=
, if you're looking for a "battery detector" to use as a control device for=
 drainage in your equipment, wouldn't a battery-operated flashlight work ju=
st as well (for example, your camcorder's fresh battery drained within minu=
tes, but your control battery-operated flashlight is still going strong - p=
aranormal or not?  Or, your camcorder's fresh battery drained within minute=
s and your battery-operated flashlight goes out at the same time and the te=
mperature is at a moderate 65 F degrees - paranormal or not?)

Just some th=
oughts :)
