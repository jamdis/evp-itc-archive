<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank,

It is fascinating. That woman&#x27;s voice came though so nicely. 

I tried sitting the box near me without asking questions and as far as I can tell, no one spoke to me. When I ask questions I usually get answers, though. 

I wonder if I did it your way more often, if they may start speaking up. It seems when Steve turns on the boxes he builds, they talk to him even though he hasn&#x27;t asked anything. But then again, maybe they only do that with people who build the boxes.

&gt;  Thanks. I don&#x27;t do investigations, and usually asking questions does not
&gt; work for me, so I am not 100% on how much the entities rely on broadcast
&gt; stations, or if it&#x27;s possible to still get voices with no radio stations.
&gt; Lots of questions that need answers.
