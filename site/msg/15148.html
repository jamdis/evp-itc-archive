There could be several reasons, and it's only conjecture without comparing =
the two specific units in questions.=A0 But some ideas:

1) The battery lev=
el on one is different than the other, and causing one to function less opt=
imally and introduce noise or artifacts into the stream.
2) They were not a=
ctually 'sitting' side by side, but being swung around.
3) They are pointed=
 at different areas
4) One may be older than the other or have been dropped=
 a few times.
5) One may have been recently exposed to extreme humidity or =
temperatures, while the other remained in a comfortable environment, before=
 doing this recording
6) One may be sitting in a position more subject by a=
irflow or vibrations
7) They may use different memory cards. that have diff=
erent error or accuracy profiles
8) The final sound files may have been pro=
cessed differently in various software programs
9) People in the room may b=
e nearer and moving closer to one than the other
10) They may simply be two=
 different models with different recording sensitives and limitations

Hi, 

  I believe I saw an explaination on this list about why if you have =
2 recorders sitting side by side, why may one capture an EVP on one and not=
 the other?  Someone was explaining about an energy field like a bubble.

I'm trying to explain this theory to a friend.  Can someone help me?
