<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Andy, 

I&#x27;ll try that with the next one, it seems much easier.  The way i 
originally did it only took 10 minutes though, but breaking a solder 
connection does seem better.

Thanx,
-Steve H.

&gt; Full credit to Steve Hultay for discovering the hackability of this
&gt; radio, and as he had mentioned in the past, it really wasn&#x27;t the
&gt; easiest. After tearing it apart, cutting, desoldering, etc...to 
locate
&gt; the mute wire/pin/solder pad, I found out that it can be one of the
&gt; easiest hacks out there. 
&gt; 
&gt; Rather than disassembling and such, simply cut the trace on each 
side
&gt; of the mute pin solder pad. Takes about 30 seconds with a hobby 
knife.
&gt; I felt really stupid after 4 hours taking everything apart and
&gt; desoldering wires, etc...
&gt; 
&gt; instructions with photos can be found on my blog if interested.

&gt; 
&gt; The sound quality of this thing really rocks, and I love the 
external
&gt; antenna options...
&gt; 
&gt; thanks
