I forgot to ask for the scientfic aproval before posting.\nAdmittedly, I was being mean spirited on purpose, I&#39;m not going to allow\nsome science dork to brow beat me into submission. I believe the home page\nof EVP-ITC says something to the effect that we don&#39;t follow science, this\nis for sharing information, and using the cut and try method, see what\nworks. I know everyone hears different, and that&#39;s ok, that does not\ninvalidate this stuff.
