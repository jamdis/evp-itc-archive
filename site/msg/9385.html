<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>How cool. LOL.

I love it that she tattled on the dog. Rofl.

If you have a website, I would love to see your ITC photos of animals.

That is so awesome. I feel that our family and friends take care of
our pet babies when they go to the Other Side.

My friend that came through on the EVP on Sunday was such a wonderful
woman. She loved animals like I do. She owned a Bakery and lived
across the street from me for years. The dog that my first wife and I
had at that time was a Scottish Terrier named Abbra (Her official name
was Aberdeen, as in the Scottish town) anyway, I used to hear Jean
talking and I would look out the window and there she would be,
sneaking snacks to Miss Abbra who needed bakery snacks about like I
do. LOL. Thats when we figured out why Miss Abbra wasn&#x27;t losing weight
on her new diet. LOL.

Blessings All,

&gt; That&#x27;s awesome, Jeremy.  I have some EVP of a woman talking to my
dog.  One time when I 
&gt; was recording, my dog (Kindred) started barking.  When I listened
back to the session (this 
&gt; was tradition EVP done in silence with a digital recorder) she had
said, &quot;Kindred.  What was 
&gt; that?&quot;  
&gt; 
&gt; In another, Kindred barks, then the woman says, &quot;Kindred.  She
thinks you&#x27;re sleeping.&quot;  I 
&gt; also have one of someone telling her &quot;NO&quot; and I really like the one
where someone tattles 
&gt; on her to me, &quot;Kindred&#x27;s headed for the dumpster.&quot;  LOL.  Just goes
to show you they are 
&gt; not only keeping an eye on us, but the animals too.  I think it&#x27;s
great that sometimes they 
&gt; are talking directly to the dog.  
&gt; 
&gt; I only have one involving my cat, Kizmyt, where someone says, &quot;Stay
back&quot; (the cat had 
&gt; come into the room as I was recording).
&gt; 
&gt; I have gotten many ITC images of animals, so clearly they are an
important part of the 
&gt; spirit realm.  :-)  As well, I had animals come through during
sitting with a medium.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for sharing about your Molly EVP!  It made me smile.

&gt; &gt; Hello Again Margaret,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I forgot to tell you this earlier. Since you are also a dog owner I
&gt; &gt; know you will appreciate this.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The day before yesterday I received an EVP. Male Voice.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; He takes what sounds like a breath and says...Pooch. :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I, of course always have Molly, my Jack Russell Terrier by my side
&gt; &gt; when I record.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, I guess I have a Spirit Friend that loves animals too. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Grin.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Take care.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Many Blessings All,
&gt; &gt;
