Musical notes, snippets of dialogue in \nmultiple languages, allophones, crowd noise, me saying &quot;the quick brown \nfox..&quot; pangram worked very well. If you want I can send you a few that \nhave worked for me or upload them to my esnips.\n\nMisty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@...m, &quot;Rebecca&quot; &lt;harvesthearth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Misty posted:\n&gt; &gt; Cool Becca. Sounded like you used the allophone file for the raw\n&gt; audio. Ive had some good results using Stefans evpmaker software. \n&gt; \n&gt; I did. I think that sample was the allophone slowed by 20%.\n&gt; \n&gt; What else other than white noise / allophone do people use?\n&gt; \n&gt; ~ Becca\n&gt;"}
