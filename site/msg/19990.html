<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Homer was an ancient greek writer, Sybil was the psychic oracles they used
in the way back times. If memeory serves, they mentioned these ancient
prophecies on History&#x27;s Nostradomus Effect series. These ancient pschic did
not have all the stupid distractions we do, like radio TV and friggin&#x27; ipods
stuck in their ears. So their psychic sense was much more active. I think
they studied this time--our time, the end times- in great detail. That&#x27;s why
there are images of planes and helicopters in pyramids, scuba divers,
submarines, men in space suites--and on and on.  I know, everyone knows
better. I see stuff ahead of time, and my senses are pathetic. I don&#x27;t know
what I&#x27;m seeing til I see it in real life,  I dreamed about he shuttle
blowing the night before, but didn&#x27;t know what it was til later in the day.
