<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You&#x27;re correct Bruce, I only own a RS Hack 12-469 that I am testing.
You are incorrect about my concerns for research. You may look at me
as a stirrer of whatever you want to say I&#x27;m stirring. If it causes
one of you to consider the validity of the research then that is
great. One of you were very surprised to discover that time is being
removed from posted files. One of you freaked out when I suggested
that raw files should be whats posted. One offered to post both. One
said no way! One of you has files incredibly clearer than anyone else.
One of you is beginning to look a little less on the up and up. Two
have emailed me their own concerns for the integrity in research. Call
me what you will but, if integrity is what has you riled up, if a
desire for raw true files to be posted causes an issue then so be it.
Maybe your smelling the shit I stirred and maybe thats because you
just might be standing in it.

&gt; Ann,
&gt;  
&gt; Don&#x27;t apologise and don&#x27;t be sucked in!
&gt; she&#x27;s a spy and a crap stirrer, the less she is here the better.
&gt;  
&gt; She has no concern for the research or how it is conducted. Her only
goal is to
&gt; cause disention whithin the group.
&gt;  
&gt; So maybe if we don&#x27;t pay attention to her she will go back where she
came from.
&gt; Also she can not post any box files because she does not have any.

&gt; 
&gt; If I misunderstood, then I certainly apologize.  
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps we&#x27;d react differently if you participated here more
often--posting your own files and asking questions of researchers. For
example, &quot;Hey, Ann--that file you just posted, I hear what you do, but
is anything clipped out of it? I think I hear a track silenced, too.
If so, why did you do that?&quot; Then I get to answer and explain why I
did it that way, offer the raw clip, or whatever. It doesn&#x27;t come off
as a broad attack--just a friendly question. Even Bruce wouldn&#x27;t rip
out your living eyeballs for that. (Well... maybe he wouldn&#x27;t, anyway.
;) ) 
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with your search for The Truth. I really do. That&#x27;s why you
see me get all rough-and-tumble over stuff like the Luminator when I
think it is it lacking convincing evidence. But it&#x27;s waaaaaay too
early in &quot;boxology&quot; to try to make it perform as a pet circus animal.
Hell, we&#x27;ve been studying traditional EVP for 30 years and it still
won&#x27;t perform on cue for the scientists or anyone else. But if you
just listen to what you get on your own and what all the others are
getting, it becomes very clear indeed that a real phenomenon is
occurring. Sure, some things we get that we think are paranormal may
be just radio fragments, but one radio fragment does not negate all
box communication. One tweaked clip is not indicative of a culture of
researcher deceit. One &quot;I am Bazoozoo! Time to fry, foolish mortal!&quot;
does not mean that the RS hacks are pathways to Satan&#x27;s indoor
plumbing. There are no easy answers yet--and there may never be any.
And I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re at the stage yet where we have the right to
demand The Truth or whether we would even see it if it was staring us
in the face.
&gt; 
&gt; All right, enough joy in myself one-hand clapping.
&gt; 
&gt; LC is right that if you want to try to pursue this in the way you
want to pursue it, then you need to find some people who share your
mindset and go to it. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to find those people
here, necessarily--at least among the old guard. We&#x27;re the beatniks in
black leather, smoking ciggies and reading bad poetry to the beat of
bongos, HMO.

&gt; Just to clear things up.. the file I&#x27;m referring to is not from
anyoneinvolved in this group so when I say that occasionally I hear
theirvoices become shaky, that is not a comment on anyone here.
Also,please don&#x27;t misread what I actually said. The point I made, or
triedto make, about the investigators not hearing what I heard...
Iwouldn&#x27;t have heard all of it in real time either. Too many
layers,too fast, etc. I have the luxury now of sitting and analyzing
the filein my own time. As for fear being a factor... I do believe
that the attitude of theinvestigators present during a session does
effect the outcome. EvenBruce who would rather cut my eyeballs out
with a razor has said thesame. If you think that I am scared, fine. If
I&#x27;m missing one thing itis probably a healthy dose of fear. Don&#x27;t make
the mistake of missingthe points by name calling. I post my thoughts
here because it is an active group of peopleworking with this form of
ITC. You can call me a shit stirrer orwhatever you want. The point is
that I see issues that could beaddressed fairly easily. You can ignore
it or deflect all you want.For me, it&#x27;s not about being friends, it&#x27;s
about the research. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Ratka

&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh dear. Here we go again.&gt; &gt; &gt; Look, Babs--it&#x27;s really just
this simple: if you are scared of lowerentities and you think that the
hacked radio you are using is really achannel for demon or whatever,
then just stop. Put the fricking radiodown and go get another hobby.
Leave it to those of us who aren&#x27;tafraid and don&#x27;t care if someone
calls us a bitch or a slut and triesto pawn themselves off as
Bazoozoo.&gt; &gt; &gt; Just. Stop. Listening. And. Worrying.&gt; &gt; &gt; And on top
of all that, in this quote below, you seem to be sayingthat the rest
of us don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing or are being fooled byentities that
only you have sussed. Guess what? You&#x27;re wrong on bothcounts, HMO.&gt; &gt;

recently started analyzing a 40 min 469 session. The results are&gt;
scary. I&#x27;d say at this point, and I&#x27;m only 1/2 way through, 90% of
the&gt; communication is negative in nature and mentions many supposed
Demonic&gt; names. The layers of voices are, in many cases, multiple.
Often, the&gt; listener hears very little of what is actually said. The
voices can be&gt; mocking or downright crude. I have not yet formed an
opinion fully but&gt; it would seem to me that these models are easy
devices for lower level&gt; entities to figure out how to use. I can not
speak of the attitudes or&gt; fears of those investigators present
although at times, their voices&gt; are a bit shaky. &gt; &gt; Babs&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
