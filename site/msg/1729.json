We just have to \nlisten and learn.  Also the noise in the background of this file was \na pretty good thunderstorm we were having here in NJ and you can \nhear the thunder during the &quot;Sumption&quot; part.  I find i get the best \nresults during storms and any kind of bad weather, they seem more \ntalkative than for some reason.  It must be the electricity from the \nstorm that they can feed off of to gain more control of the box.\n\nJust a guess, i really don&#39;t know why it&#39;s better during storms.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Yeah, can hear that too.
