Let's star=
t something new....

The Angry Ghost Box Awards... for the recognition of u=
tter stupidity and unscrupulousness in the field of ghost box communication=
.

First place goes to, well, no need to utter the name again, but this per=
son is a self-proclaimed "bitch" with a Ph.D.

Anyone want to take second p=
lace? Seriously....

Having a Ph.D. does not exempt you from being awarded,=
 btw.... On the contrary it only makes you more deserving of the award, bec=
ause you don't live up to the high caliber expected of your credential.
