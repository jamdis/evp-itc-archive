For me they are quite loud and the clarity was great. I recorded these on a night of the full moon (which does seem to help).\n\nAttaching a few of the clearer ones to this post and for those who dont get the dailies you can listen on my esnips site. For the other methods click on my profile there and you will see folders listed.\n\nhttp://www.esnips.com/web/NewEVPVoices\n\nMisty\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1677008638-1231871505=:15441\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;011009_CLR-imtired.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;011009_CLR-imtired.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--0-1677008638-1231871505=:15441\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;011009_CLR-stopfollowingme.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;011009_CLR-stopfollowingme.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--0-1677008638-1231871505=:15441\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;011009_CLR-theresan-eerieunderstandingbetweenus.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;011009_CLR-theresan-eerieunderstandingbetweenus.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--0-1677008638-1231871505=:15441--"}
