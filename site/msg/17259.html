&gt;&gt;   Because you are an egotistical know it all that lives in a shallow and

&gt;&gt; attacks anyone that questions your theories?  It can&#x27;t be all hogwash
&gt;&gt; because you might have an emotional investment in this, right?  So you go
&gt;&gt; after anyone of opposition with the full fury of a raving lunatic?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That is what I am reading, but carry on.  Keep digging the hole.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If there is truth to any of this, then lets see it.  At this point I am
&gt;&gt; real close to telling you where you can stick your damn box!

&gt;&gt;  I&#x27;m just sayin&#x27;--there are a very few that act like all is known and can
&gt;&gt; all be expelaned away. It&#x27;s those few that make comments back and forth,
&gt;&gt; between themselves implying that all this is foolishness, and they know so
&gt;&gt; much better. I don&#x27;t know why why, but that stuff really chaps my hide!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I know for a fact that some of the voices out of the box, and other
&gt;&gt; methods are imagination, as they tend to change from day to as perceptions
&gt;&gt; shift. I have stuff form ten years ago that sound the same, and I aslo have
&gt;&gt; tapes from the first boxes that talk about what&#x27;s going on now. I have some
&gt;&gt; voice segments for m years ago that are also gibberish and noise.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I don&#x27;t need some duffus telling me how I fool myself.
