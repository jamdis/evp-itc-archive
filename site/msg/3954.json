Who are these\n&gt;&gt; &gt; entities we are talking to and why would it be such a problem for\n&gt;&gt; us\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to know who they were in life? If these are dead humans, it can&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; see\n&gt;&gt; &gt; how it would make any difference at all. In fact, to me, being\n&gt;&gt; able\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to talk about human things with them is rather the only way to\n&gt;&gt; prove\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that they are dead humans. It does concern me that these entities\n&gt;&gt; are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not human, not because I would particularly care if they were\n&gt;&gt; &gt; extraterrestrial or extradimentional and just admitted that, but\n&gt;&gt; &gt; because my personal desire is to talk to people like me who have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; crossed over.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Can you ask them to give you some sort of reason why they can&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; tell\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you more about themselves?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, my 2 cents. I know that my line of inquiry with the box is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; going to be directed at people who have crossed.

I also get the impression that\n&gt;&gt; they\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; want to remain as separate entities in my mind\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and if I where to know who and what they where in the physical\n&gt;&gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; would reduce them to a lower level of spirituality\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in my mind. that is the general jist of the messages as far as\n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; subject goes.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Paranormal Investigating Team\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: lisby@...\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Wed, 5 Dec 2007 19:06:23 -0500\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Comments for Bruce\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rambling thoughts:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The sound quality was not as good with this batch.

I have two, both male, and god knows who they really are,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; because one has changed identity at least six times over the\n&gt;&gt; years,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and one won&#39;t tell anything at all about himself. Period. Oh, he\n&gt;&gt; says\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that he won&#39;t talk through the box either. I&#39;m tempted to add,  \n&gt;&gt; &quot;So\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; there&quot; as a direct quote. LOL. Anyway, Mike and Lisa-- So Mike\n&gt;&gt; says\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he bled to death in &#39;95; Lisa choked to death in the 1920s and\n&gt;&gt; nuts\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to you for asking, apparently. ;)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Would you ask them some questions for me?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask Mike which &#39;95 he died in--1995 or 1895?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask Lisa what her favorite perfume was.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask them both more biographical questions, such as where the were\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; born, lived, and died. Their full names. Their spouses&#39; names,\n&gt;&gt; kids,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; etc. I&#39;m a historian/geneologist and I think it would be a blast\n&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; look in available records to try to identify them.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask them the year of their birth.
