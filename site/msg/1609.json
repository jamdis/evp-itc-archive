It made from Bakelite, even the stick plate is. I still need\nto wire it up so I just placed the components on the still unassembled\nboard and uploaded a pic in my photo album on this forum. The stick\nplate is also made of Bakelite but I placed a small plastic square\nwhere the stick pad goes. My crazy plane was to adapt it to the tuning\nmechanism of Frank&#39;s Box to allow an intuitive tactile feedback\ninterface so I could try to find the frequencies where spirits contact\nus. \n\nSort of like the manual linear sweep but with a stick pad added. These\n3 dial machines are still available from Bill Jensen out of Knoxville\nTN who makes them to original spec except with modern internal\ncircuitry. -Bill Murphy\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, 16 Jul 2007, Frank Sumption wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; This time I made a small plastic echo box.

ABS plastic, PVC, Delrin, acrylic, PTFE (teflon), \n&gt; Cyrolon ZX ...\n&gt; \n&gt; It might be interesting to experiment with different types and see what \n&gt; works the best.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone here ever build a Hieronymus machine?  I understand teflon (or \n&gt; fiberglass-teflon PC board material) works incredibly well for the\n&gt; &quot;stick&quot; sensor plate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt;"}
