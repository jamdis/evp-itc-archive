                =C2=A0                             I would be cautiou=
s accepting responses from a box as gospel.  I have had contradictory respo=
nses about religion come through, but then again, I align myself much close=
r with atheism than christianity.  
 
 Many times I feel that the boxes tel=
l us what we want to hear.  Why? I could not tell you.  It could be spirits=
 playing with our heads, or, it could be a piece of our unconscious coming =
through the radio.  This does happen, I have recorded the voices of people =
in the same room with me coming through with the same speech patterns (alth=
ough this happened twice with a Shack hack but I haven't had it happen with=
 my Minibox yet).  
 
 So in short, if you ascribe to a belief and keep ask=
ing pointed questions about that belief over and over, do not be surprised =
when you hear what you believe coming through the box.
