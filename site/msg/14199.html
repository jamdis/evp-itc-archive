That's the ticket. We both really wanted to know the truth no matter who wa=
s right or wrong - we weren't arguing just for the sake of it.

Just FYI-It=
 isn't that I am against using the scientific method. In fact I do employ i=
t when investigating anything, just for my own satisfaction. I want to beli=
eve my evidence, so I have to be as scientific about it as possible, but no=
t so I can prove it to anyone else, just myself.

In Frank's case, maybe he=
 doesn't want or need to prove it to himself scientifically, and that is fi=
ne too.

        Who to go to?  The scientific method!

      =
  This was a good example of how a couple people, with differing opinions b=
ut open minds, can follow an objective methodology to root out the right an=
swer.

        1) Observation.  We heard (indirectly) that someone has seen=
 wave files experience lossy compression when sent through email clients.

=
        2) Hypothesis.  The theory is that the email client, and/or email s=
ervers, perform lossy compression on their attachments for wave files.

   =
     3) Predictions.  Based on this hypothesis, this should be observable b=
y attaching and sending large waves files through some email servers, and c=
omparing both the originals, and the final files.  If original files and th=
e final files should experience differences in contents.

        4) Experi=
ments.  We sent different files, of different sizes, through different clie=
nts and servers.  

        5) Analyze results.  We compared the originals =
at the byte level, and found no loss.

        6) Interpret.  No compressio=
n was observed in our tests, and so no compression is being done with the s=
ervers and clients and environments in which we tested.  This does not make=
 any claims about other tests or environments, but provides good testing an=
d predictions for what would be expected based on our tests.

        Witho=
ut this kind of method, we could have just gone back and forth giving subje=
ctive or emotional arguments, with no real evidence.  But following this ki=
nd of method, we get to what we really both wanted: reliable interpretation=
 of phenomenon.

        And this doesn't mean we need to close the books f=
orever.  More prediction, more experiments, more results can be tried by mo=
re people, published, and reproduced.  The body of knowledge then grows wid=
er, deeper, and more reliable.

        This is why I push the scientific m=
ethod even with EVP studies, even while others continue subjective or emoti=
onal arguments: to improve the study, and to allow progress to be made by a=
s many people as possible.

                            If the audio had been resampled, you co=
uld expect less bytes, or different bytes, but not the same number of the s=

 if no changes are found.

                                They are not nec=
essarily the same bytes, but I was proposing a quick check just to see if t=
he files were in the same ballpark.  Look at it the other way: if the numbe=
r of bytes were DIFFERENT, than you'd know the files HAD changed, and you c=
ould stop testing.  But if the number of bytes are the same, it tends to in=
dicate the files are likely the same, but you still need a low level file c=
omparison to be sure.

                                My method is to comp=
are the files using the CMP command in unix.  There are many programs to co=
mpare files, but you have to be careful not to use one that does a line-by-=
line compare (or a comparison meant for text files), since text files can b=
e different at a low level, but look essential the same in an editor (becau=
se of the way spaces and tabs and new lines work between editors and platfo=
rms).

                                But anyway, the way to compare is wi=
th a program that can compare binary files, not text files.

                                A file's content, it's integrity, is =
simply the bytes (and their bits) in the file.  If the file's content integ=
rity is changed, that is, by definition, changing the bytes.  If the bytes =
in there are not changed, then that integrity has not changed.

           =
                     It is possible to mess with other things about a file =
(like its name, its suffix, or its ownership) but this does not effect the =
contents, and so would not affect that integrity, or the sound of the file =
(assuming you could read it at all after changing the ownership, or the suf=
fix, etc).

                                When you do your tests, if you =
cannot do a bit level comparison, I would recommend at least checking the f=
ile sizes.  If they are identical, there is a very high probability that th=
e content has not changed.

 file each came from, there would be no way to tell.  Even the audio player=
 could not tell.  The data is identical, and so the sound (or the picture, =

                                This kind of compression d=
oes things like looking for common patterns in the file, and replacing them=
 with a token.  A rough example would be if it found "Howdy Neighbor" in a =
file 20 times, it could replace all the occurances with say $HN1.  And also=
 write a little dictionary in there someplace that says "$HN1=3DHowdy Neigh=
bor".

                                When the file gets to its destinatio=
n it can be uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are replaced with "How=
dy Neighbor".  So it was compressed (instead of 14 characters each, it only=
 needed 4, plus the dictionary), but lost no data.

                       =
         Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not lossless.  Depending on t=
he level of compression, some level of data is lost, and so cannot be recov=
ered or reconstructed later.

Another thing:

                                I recently found this out. =
When you email a file, if it is not saved as a compressed format, the email=
 filtering process will actually compress the file automatically.

        =
                        So even if you have attached a wav. file, it will l=
oose resolution over the email process. It will not sound exactly the same =
as the original wav. file. How much it differs depends on the size of the f=
ile you are attaching. If it is a very large file, it will sound much diffe=
rent.

                                The only exception to this is if the=
 wav. file is small enough that the filtering process will ignore it. It ha=
s to be pretty small though, like under 1 MB (I am not exactly sure of the =
threshold).

                                The best way to share files ov=
er the internet if you want them as close to the original as possible is to=
 upload them directly to a website.

       Pixelization doesn't clean-up the data: it replaces it.  Imagine tak=
ing a picture of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixeliz=
ation to the picture.  Soon, you would not be able to tell there were flowe=
rs there at all.  You would see a lot of colored blocks.

                 =
               Or in the other direction, imagine you are looking at a comp=
etely randomize bunch of pixes on your screen: a complete screen of truely =
random static snow.  Pixelizing this, after a while, you would again start =
to see colored blocks.

                                What's happening is=
 that it is processing an area of the image, taking (for instance) the aver=
age value of that entire area, and replacing all the blocks in that area wi=
th the average.  In video processing, this would result in a field of multi=
-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish bloc=
k, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise example, it maybe replace =
all the random pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.  If you did no=
t know beforehand what the original picture was, you couldn't tell whether =
your pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, the sky with c=
louds, or a random bunch of pixels.

                                It wor=
ks the same with the sound files.  Taking something as complex as speech, a=
nd replacing frequencies with their averages, loses the speech the farther =
you go, until you head strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the same to=
 random static will eventually produce the same thing.  And random fluctuat=
ing square waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, you could have =
fun sharing with each other what you thing they 'sound like'.

                                Be a bit careful of f=
ormats like mp3 if you are doing a detailed analysis of the sounds though. =
  While some formats (like wav) can store the audio very close to the way i=
t was recorded, formats like mp3 compress the file, and in so doing lose so=
me of the sonic details.  This may not be a big deal in music, where the au=
dio is fairly clear to begin with.  But with sound sources with a lot of no=
ise (like evps), this can not only obscure any real sounds, but pixelize no=
n-sounds (like white noise) and make them start to sound like speech.

    =
                            So mp3 might be good for sharing the data, once=
 you've already formed an opinion based on an analysis of the wav file.  Bu=
t mp3 is not good as a medium for analysis.  It can lead to many false posi=
tives and misinterpretations.
