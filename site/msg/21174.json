I have never encountered one.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do have a lot of ghost recordings. So far, all I&#39;ve gotten indicate\n&gt; &gt; they are/were just people like you and me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zack\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On 3/18/11, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  I&#39;ve had enough of the stupid demon infested, all Holloween, paranormal BS.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That can not possibly get any further away from spirit, and what spirit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; communication really is, and what it is for. You all can follow the childish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crap is ya want, but I will not particapate. I will not make anymore boxes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for people that want to run around in the dark chasing evil, and trying to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get a fear rush going.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Already dumped one group this week, I can dump this one too. Y&#39;all can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hear one freaking thing I say anyway.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
