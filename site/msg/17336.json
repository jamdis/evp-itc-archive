If you did then please refresh my memory. This seems to\n&gt;&gt; more about commenting on what others share for you than it is about doing\n&gt;&gt; any research yourself. Im not sure what you are looking for, if you are here\n&gt;&gt; to learn, correspond, or if you are just here to get a rise out of others\n&gt;&gt; but to be honest I do not have time for it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Whether Frank bans anyone or not is up to him entirely. But I have warned\n&gt;&gt; you before and I am saying it again. Cut the crap and move on. That goes for\n&gt;&gt; ALL of you. I dont mind discussions, I dont mind differences of opinion but\n&gt;&gt; I do mind BS.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you have research to share then do so, if your research yeilds no\n&gt;&gt; results then state it as such. If your only purpose for being in this group\n&gt;&gt; is to question others, disect them, and cause negative discussions then\n&gt;&gt; perhaps you are wasting your time here. You are definitely wasting mine.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Misty\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nThe e's o he op ions han banning, like no allowing ce ain membe s o pos any hing. \n \nF-S\nOn F i, May 28, 2010 a 6:54 AM, F ank Sump ion pu plealiengi l@gmail.com> w o e:\n\n I ha en' banned anyone--ye , cuz I'm no su e i 's ai , Bu   he e a e  he ew people ha can' hea any hing, don' do any \" esea ch\", hen ell o he s wha he oices, and he es o he pa ano mal  eally is a e insul ing, dis up i e, and is no wha his g oup is o .
