The t=\r\nones are mixed with the radio audio. The exact frequency is not all the imp=\r\nortant, as these are square waves, which contain all harmonics. This is man=\r\nual sweep only, the sweep circuit is not build yet. \n \n My approach is test=\r\ning and developing, I don&#39;t try to sell this stuff at this point, and I can=\r\n&#39;t make boxes for very many requesters, I just don&#39;t have the time. I&#39;ve sa=\r\nid it a thousand times, the box is not the only method, there are many rela=\r\nted methods of using raw audio.
