<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi, Zack.

I have my BSEE from U of I in your neck of the woods! Yep...I&#x27;ve 
lived on campus in both Urbana and Champaign. It&#x27;s been years since 
I&#x27;ve been back (actually - not since I graduated in 
1980...lol...THAT dates me!). I&#x27;ve studied on and off for both my 
commercial radio license and ham license but just never followed 
through on getting them - too many other things going on.

By the way - I was born and raised in Moline (the Quad Cities) but 
now I&#x27;m thoroughly &quot;embedded&quot; here in Southern California...no more 
ice and freezing cold and snow for me!

Have you downloaded and tried Stefan Bion&#x27;s EVPMaker yet? As you 
know from reading Frank&#x27;s documentation - that&#x27;s what he based 
the &quot;Ghost Box&quot; on...

Anyhow - welcome!

Guy

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I just joined and I thought I&#x27;d introduce myself.
&gt; 
&gt; I am an electrical engineer, radio amateur and a ghost hunter 
living in 
&gt; Urbana, IL. (Well, I like the term &quot;paranormal investigator&quot; 
better!)
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of EVP&#x27;s on a pocket DVR but I found and 
downloaded the 
&gt; schematics for Frank&#x27;s ghost box some months ago.  I&#x27;m fascinated 
by this 
&gt; idea and I hope I can find the time to build the equipmeont some 
time 
&gt; soon. Hopefully I will get beyond the 70-80 hour work weeks I&#x27;ve 
been 
&gt; putting in for the last couple months ...
&gt; 
&gt; Looking forward to seeing what&#x27;s happening on this group!
&gt; 
&gt; Zack
