Please do not get mad at me, i want to be honest.  I heard a couple of words here and there, but nothing i could make out clearly.  \n\nThe recording was really bad, i couldn&#39;t even tell that it was a box that i was listening to.  It sounded like you were under water and the file was over processed to death.\n\nI know you didn&#39;t over process it, so it was probably just a bad recording.  Try again when you get that new recorder, it really does make a difference to the people who listen to the files.\n\nI&#39;m sorry i could not make anything out, but i&#39;m sure it was a great session.  I just wanted to be honest about what i heard on my end.\n\n-Steve\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; ok I attached it on here also here is a link from my Facebook Page of the file also..just in case didn&#39;t come through on email\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; http://www.facebook.com/pages/Chicago-Paranormal-Research-Institute/103692323002192?v=app_2392950137&ref=ts#!/video/video.php?v=1526451396123\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; --- On Mon, 1/10/11, Urkel23 &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Urkel23 &lt;urkel23@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] STEVE Re: Ok,(original file)\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Monday, January 10, 2011, 5:09 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I just got home from work, i will check it out in a bit.
