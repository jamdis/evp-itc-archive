<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s that other 10% that I&#x27;m after!
:-)

Twice now I have gotten names given to me in an EVP. Both names are not
names I was familiar with, nor would I have pulled them out of the air
myself. Both names were unheard of to every member of the group present. And
both names, after a somewhat extensive search of the history of the sites,
turned out to be real names of real people who had lived or died in those
locations in the past.

How would you explain that? I think they fit that other 10%.

&gt; If you read my posts you&#x27;ll know I think these so called &quot;investigations&quot;
&gt; are a complete waste of time since 90% of the evidence is based on
&gt; seggestion, and you can create the phenomenon you want to experience. I
&gt; don&#x27;t do investigations, and don&#x27;t go to haunted hot spots to get EVPS.
&gt; &quot;They&quot; will come to you, spirits and entities are everywhere, they travel
&gt; it&#x27;s not dangerous, and there are no portals. Most do these ghost hunts for
&gt; a fear rush. Why else would ya do this crap in the dark--so ya can sneak up
&gt; on ghost?
