&gt; Is that China story true?  I read about that a week or so ago but hadn&#x27;t
&gt; heard anything about it since.  Nice piece of audio by the way, they say
&gt; &quot;Down&quot; twice and sing it once.  What are the chances of getting that word
&gt; three times in a row?

&gt;&gt;  On C2C the other night Noory mentioned a town in China that seemingly
&gt;&gt; disappeared,  I was asking what happend to it, and in this video at 4
&gt;&gt; seconds &quot;the town went down&quot;. this is random mode. That&#x27;s the problem, I
&gt;&gt; hear this stuff different all the time, and which hearing is the correct
&gt;&gt; one, or is there a correct one?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  At 11 seconds &quot;what is the Earth--What is doom&quot; wierd., and &quot;German
&gt;&gt; hostage&quot; at the end.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  This one going to Rolling Hills too.
