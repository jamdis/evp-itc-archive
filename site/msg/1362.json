The linear radio sweep method should work with any recorder or computer, it&#39;s simple and it works. Here is another example from today using EVP maker. It sounds like a diction lesson.\n&quot;Dispute edited with pursuit&quot;\nDave\n\n--- lisby@... wrote:\n\nFrom: Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] EVP Maker & Optical Link Experiment\nDate: Mon, 11 Jun 2007 14:38:24 -0400\n\nI knew it! :)\n\nI almost said, &quot;I think you just got two EVPs from John Lennon.&quot;\n\nWow. That was so eerie, it made my skin crawl.\n\nHey--is there anyway to get EVP to work on a Mac system? Any ideas?\n\nAnn\n\nOn Jun 11, 2007, at 12:57 PM, RetroCom wrote:\n\n&gt; I used a one sided John Lennon interview.

The link consists of a red LED coupled to the sound\n&gt;&gt; source (EVP Maker or Linear radio  sweep) and the resultant\n&gt;&gt; modulated light is picked up by a photomultiplier tube.  The output\n&gt;&gt; of the tube is recorded on a VHS VCR (analog).
