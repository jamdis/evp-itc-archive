Ive wrote \nsome articles years ago on the subject, perhaps if people want the \nlinks Ill post them here. Also there are quite a few good books on the \nsubject. All 3 books by Robert A. Monroe (Journeys out of the body, Far \nJourneys, Ultimate Journey) Astral Dynamics by Robert Bruce, Cosmic \nJourneys by Rosalind Mcknight (Her accounts from working with Robert \nMonroe) The Projection of the Astral Body by Sylvan Muldoon, and if you \ncan get your hands on it Astral Projection: A Record of Out-of-the-Body \nExperiences by Oliver Fox (not his real name but who cares) that book \nis out of print so you probably have to find it online it was printed \nin 1962 or even earlier I think. Anyway this list should keep you busy \nfor now, there are a ton more good books on the subject. Well enjoy and \npractice.

It was awesome!!!! And \nthat was  back \n&gt; in 1992. Sure wish I could do it again. Maybe I will someday.\n&gt;    Suzy\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; HOSPICE- Adding life to days when we can&#39;t add days  to life.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ************************************** See what&#39;s new at \nhttp://www.aol.com\n&gt;"}
