You&#39;ll get the same patch cable AND an adapter (1/8 female to 3/32 male, I \nthink, \n&gt; double check).  That&#39;s what I have to use on my Panasonic DR60, since the ear jack on \nthat is \n&gt; smaller.\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am heading to Radio shack after I get off work. I am taking the \n&gt; &gt; micro cassette recorder with me. The mic hole in the recorder is way \n&gt; &gt; smaller then the one that goes into the pc. The recorder is a Radio \n&gt; &gt; Shack recorder so hopefully they will have one. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
