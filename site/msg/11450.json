I don&#39;t know who you would contact re\nthe theater.  The investigations that I&#39;ve done there have been part\nof Troy Taylor&#39;s conferences.  If your group attends one of his\nconferences, they can investigate that way. I have been to Greenwood\nCemetery but have not done an investigation there.\n\nYou could inquire with Troy at www.prairieghosts.com re the situation\nwith the theater.

I am in Champaign-Urbana, which is only an hour\nfrom \n&gt; Decatur.  One paranormal group I&#39;m in is trying to get permission to \n&gt; invetigate the Lincoln Theater. I have never been in it but quite a few \n&gt; people in this area have and there are lots of stories, pictures\netc. of \n&gt; it around.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another haunted place in Decatur is the Greenwood Cemetery.  Now,\nthat one \n&gt; I HAVE been in. During our recent flooding, about 40% of that\ncemetery was \n&gt; under water. Very sad. Since it&#39;s dried out a bit, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s \n&gt; receded by now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, 1 Jul 2008, rosemary_guiley wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zack,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was at the Lincoln Theater in October, and one of the Chicago\n&gt; &gt; researchers got an amazing photograph of a Shadow Person in the main\n&gt; &gt; seating area.  I took the Mini to the Mezzanine because I had seen an\n&gt; &gt; apparition of a man in a dark suit there -- he kept walking up to me\n&gt; &gt; and standing next to me, then vanishing.  But I did not hear anything\n&gt; &gt; obvious via the box there.  The basement was the best.  There is a lot\n&gt; &gt; going on in that theater.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rosemary\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I know some people who got a VIDEO of One-Armed Red a few years ago\n&gt; &gt; in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; basement.

The files are too large to be uploaded to the forum here,\nbut a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; short video with the audio clips has been posted on You Tube by Joey\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Tito, a Chicago researcher who filmed the investigation.  The audio\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; clips are at the end, and Joey matched them to a transcript of\nwhat I\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; picked up.  I sent the clips to Frank, and he picked up even more.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The You Tube link is www.youtube.com/xflexx1  Joey has a short\nversion\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and a long version; pick the short one.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I have a report on the investigation posted on my blog on MySpace at\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; www.myspace.com/rosemaryellenguiley  and Joey&#39;s video is on my home\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; page there as well.
