The small \ninternal chamber will tend to accentuate the higher noise frequencies-\n-I think. I have the same system using the same chip, and use a \nreally large external box with it. The echo box is nothing but an \nenclosure with a speaker on one side, and the mic on the other--use \nelectret mic elements and 8 ohm speakers. The are jacks for external \nmic and speaker on #27. That&#39;s why I included that function. That \nchip&#39;s output is also very noisy, I don&#39;t know how to make it better. \n\n Frank-S  \n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; All the files are rough from this box, what really sucks is they \n&gt; answer me every time and i just can&#39;t hear them over all the \nnoise.  \n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday \n&gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Steve,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m hearing &quot;accepts us Frank sumption&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The file is a little rough.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: EVP-ITC@: EVP-ITC@: Sun, 13 Jan 2008 21:05:21 \n&gt; +0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello,This email message is a notification to let you know thata \n&gt; file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; group.File : /Steve Hultay Files/Steve Hultay&#39;s Frank&#39;s Box \n&gt; #27/it_sucks---frank_sumption.mp3 Uploaded by : urkel232002 \n&gt; &lt;urkel23@&gt; Description : &quot;It Sucks Frank Sumption&quot;---Sorry Frank i \n&gt; was trying out the RVG on FM and this is what the file sounds like \nto \n&gt; me.
