Gotcha Frank.=A0 It's certainly a good thing that there are checks and bal=
ances in that system to try to both protect the child, and also protect the=
 parent and family.=A0 In this case, and as part of the diagnosis, I suspec=
t it would not be, as you said, simply a matter=A0 of what the parent belie=
ved, or even what kind of research they were doing, even if they told a soc=
ial worker or other authority about the voices they were hearing.=A0 To hav=
e someone hospitalized for a psychiatric hold (at least in my state) they h=
ave to be a danger to themselves or others, or have some other severe condi=
tion (the latter I am not so clear on).=A0 So it might be the content of th=
e ITC messages they are reporting hearing: if they were very bad and violen=
t messages, with urgings to perform harm or other bizarre behaviors for exa=
mple, the authority could determine this is a sign of being in a dangerous =
mental state, and take action.=A0 Hopefully, this is an extreme example,
 a=
nd not one anyone here will ever encounter.

But telling authorities you ar=
e hearing voices, I am not sure either way (if they don't seem dangerous ot=
herwise) what the authorities would do.=A0 It may be as you said: it depend=
s on the expertise of the authority.

Your practice of ITC research does not mean you cannot care for y=
our child. Social services do not take your children for your beliefs, they=
 take them because you are not able to care for them properly and/or are ab=
usive. Look at any number of fanatical religious practices or=A0belief syst=
ems=A0just in the US and you see a bunch of children being subjected to som=
e pretty scary ideas. Belief is not a requisite for this research, only the=
 desire to communicate.
=A0
Mental health is defined as the psychological s=
tate of someone who is functioning at a satisfactory level of emotional, co=
gnitive=A0and behavioral adjustment. The condition of 'normal' would be def=
ined as the average of social expectations, which can be completely differe=
nt from one culture to the next. I'm not bragging by stating that I am in t=
he process of completling my master of science in Psychology. I am just add=
ing a little credibility to my definitions.

I think Misty makes some good points, and I agree that the issue is sim=
ilar to how one exposes a child to a belief system, such as a religion.=A0 =
I agree, too, that it will depend on the individual situation, as some will=
 do this in a healthy way, and some may not: for example, we could all prob=
ably name some religious cults that have been more harmful than good.=A0 In=
 the ITC world, I suppose a bad situation would be one where a poor ITC res=
earcher (one who thinks they are getting results, but isn't) insists to the=
 child that they can hear spirits. And I suppose a good situation would be =
as Misty suggested: where an open mind is presented to them.=A0 

And as Fr=
ank noted, this likely also depends on the child. And Frank also mentioned =
something I thought was interesting: mental health.=A0 What is normal for m=
ental health is often defined as what the majority believes.=A0 Since ITC i=
s still not as big a belief system
 as other religions or belief systems, i=
t could be seen as abnormal by the uninitiated.=A0 And if Social Services w=
ere to get involved (depending on how open minded the worker was) it could =
result in a messy situation for someone who was insisting they could hear v=

 this is an overreation on my part to what Frank meant there?

I th=

 parents tried to ignore the things that they couldnt see because if you ig=
nore it then it doesnt exist right? But there comes a time when the child g=
rows up and forms thier own ideas and beliefs. Personally speaking once I r=
eached adulthood there were many other people who experienced the same thin=
gs I did in that house so I began to see that there was more to it than jus=
t a childs imagination.

Most religions are based upon the idea that there =
is a higher power, that we all have spirits, and that there is something be=
yond this life. To say that someone is wrong for belief in ghosts I would h=
ave to say that billions of others are wrong for having belief at all. I do=
nt think bad of a parent who takes their kids off to church every sunday no=
r do I think badly about a parent who spends some
 time doing ITC. Telling =
a child that there is more than what the eye can see, more than what the ea=
rs can hear, is giving them the basics for growing up with a mind thats ope=
n to possibility. What they do with that is up to them individually.

I wor=
ry more about the kids who grow up with parents who are alchoholics, drug a=
ddicts, liars, thieves, abusers, etcetera.. than anyone. 

As for if the ef=
fect is positive or negative, I think that has to do with the intent or the=
 approach taken by each individual whether it be ITC, religion, or life in =
general.
