   Finally got the radio to work, as near per=
fect as possible. It's like a big DAH! I kept trying to use an antenna ampl=
ifier, and it was overloading the radio, making it sound like crap. Curious=
ly, I drew my schematics with no antenna amp! The MK484 final IF works kick=
 butt!

   I was playing with the radio last night and just couldn't make i=
t work right, so turned it off and went to take a shower, while in the show=
er it occured to me what I was doing wrong. Yet again, no help from the out=
isde! ---or was there? Edison could not have made "a box" in his day, I thi=
nk most fo the radios were TRF, and I couldn't get any ghost voices with th=
e TRF radio. Of course, that's just one researcher, and a couple tests. If =
the box only functions as a raw audio source, any radio should work. 

   T=
he MK484 IF was off an oriental site, it was the only thing not in Chinese/=
Japanese.
