If it's getting others to use the technology and experiment and find out 
what's out there, it's at least doing that. But right now we don't even 
know if their boxes work.

As a radio amateur, I have the philosophy that all the designs I do as a 
radio amateur and all the computer/microcontroller programs I write should 
be given freely by me to others. I've even run off some pc boards and 
given them away free. I would tend to do that in this area (ITC) too as 
long as it doesn't break me.

So I see your point. I guess they're just not altruistic like Frank S. is.
