                Tonight at work I was talking to a state trooper, th=
ere had been an accident. I asked him if there were any deaths (it was very=
 very bad) and he said he didnt know so he got on his radio and called in a=
nd asked them if it was a 7 at the site. They told him negative, and he tol=
d me the little boy who was the worst off was still alive. I asked him why =
did you ask them if it was a 7. He said code 7, I was asking them if they w=
ere dead. So if you ever hear anyone call 7 over the radio that means someo=
nes dead.

                Just thought I would pass that on. I find it int=
eresting since I know alot of us have heard this before when used to descri=
be who is speaking rather than a name they say seven.
