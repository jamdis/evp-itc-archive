It talks about using the box to find missing persons (which I didn&#39;t know was possible), and the conversation mentions hearing specific voice inflections and recognizing a dead person&#39;s specific voice on the box.  My question is, do any of you get a recognizable voice?  The voices I get always sound robotic, although I do get clearly male or female voices.  \n\nhttp://www.itcbridge.com/forum/view_topic.php?id=515&forum_id=31"}
