There should be three from today. I&#39;m not usre if\nthe largest one went through, it&#39;s only 6 minutes though. then another\nis aobut a minute, and the next about 20 seconds. I had to do\nmultiples cuz the random mode wouldn&#39;t work for the first run. the\npurpose of the videos are to show the world waht the box is supposed\nto soudn like. I ask them to say my name, and they may have said\nFrank, but I could hear them say Princess a couple times. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Boo!
