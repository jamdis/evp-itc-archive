&gt; Hiya Willy (hehe I like that)
&gt;    
&gt;   You are right there are alot of Bills around here LOL
&gt;    
&gt;   I did actually get to listen to some of your desert files when 
you posted them but I had to leave for work so didnt get a chance to 
do anything at the time. I will give you a rundown of them all here 
with any differences or changes I hear in *asterisks*
&gt;    
&gt;   AndAmazinglyRicksHotIdea*Help* (same but I hear that additional 
word on end)
&gt; ButYouCalledToUs*It&#x27;s Better* (&quot;)
&gt; CheckThis*GroupEnergyWhatDoTheyTalkToAtNight* (several differences)
&gt; EachDifferentWavelengthMoves*InUsToSync* (same but additional words 
on end)
&gt; *WhatWeSee*ThatWasASpacecraft (I hear that as a multilayer. I hear 
what you hear with that other voice on top at start)
&gt; ThereAreNoEntities*Ivebeensenttoearthtobeginthedeparted* (etcetera)
&gt;   
&gt;  I will try and get back to you on more and some of the other set. 
Just tired now, its been a long work day. Great stuff tho keep it up. 
Glad they answered some of your questions for you. Ive seen quite a 
bit of strangeness over the years. And I know what its like to have 
those around you living in thier own bubble worlds...but just 
remember they think the same about us hehehe. Who&#x27;s bubble is better? 
&gt;    
&gt;   Can definitely say its all very interesting! And I enjoy bursting 
my own bubble now and then but never touch thiers =) We cant change 
anyone, except ourselves. They have to change themselves on thier 
own. But we can try to share, for those who seek to learn.

&gt;           OK, so maybe I went over the top yesterday describing my 
laptop 
&gt; setup and how I use it  sorry. I did post a bunch of EVPs 
&gt; under &quot;Laptop EVPs&quot; in the files. What I didn&#x27;t make clear is that 
I&#x27;d 
&gt; really appreciate some comments/critiques/suggestions on what I&#x27;ve 
&gt; done. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of stuff and would really like to run it by 
&gt; someone else. I asked my wife, and she got a blank look, blinked 
&gt; twice, turned and walked away. My teenage son listened to one clip 
&gt; twice, heard what I did, then had more important stuff to do. So, 
it 
&gt; would be nice to get some feedback on what I&#x27;ve done so far.
&gt; I&#x27;ve read that &quot;lower entities&quot; come across more on EVPmaker, but 
so 
&gt; far I haven&#x27;t had any rude experiences  yet. Two days ago I forgot 
to 
&gt; start the sessions with protection prayer/rules of engagement, and 
&gt; right away a Scottish voice said, &quot;Aye, it smells in here.&quot; I&#x27;ve 
got 
&gt; another folder worth of stuff to upload, but want to get some 
comments 
&gt; about my previous files first..
&gt; I&#x27;ve noticed two Bills here already, so to avoid confusion, I&#x27;ll go 
by 
&gt; Willy.
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Willy
