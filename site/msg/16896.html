<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Why do you think hearing a crackly voice saying &quot;Get out&quot; has anything to do with 2012?

Actually, btw, Edison did scientifically examine every filament he tried: he had a theory about it, he developed a test for it, he tried the test and looked at his results.  He showed the test and results were repeatable. 

That&#x27;s science right there.

&gt;  I really want to hear what others are getting concerning 2012, and anything
&gt; that&#x27;s not so much ghost hunter stuff. I mean how many times do I need to
&gt; hear a crackly voice &quot;get out&quot;?
&gt; 
&gt;  There is PurplesGroup on yahoo. Yeah, my group, I own it and if people
&gt; start that skeptic non-sense they get the boot!
&gt; 
&gt;  I have my questions, such as hauntings, I don&#x27;t believe in stuck spirits,
&gt; but I still watch Ghost Hunters from time to time and consider their
&gt; &quot;evidence&quot;. From my point of view and experience, EVP is technology, and
&gt; technology is cut and try, see what works. How many think Edison
&gt; scientifically analyzed every filament he tried for the light bulb?  If he
&gt; did it according the these modern skeptics we&#x27;d still be waiting for light
&gt; bulbs as they told him how impossible it was. That is not an exaggeration,
&gt; there&#x27;s thousands getting meaningful personal messages via the box and other
&gt; methods, often addressing them by name, that others can hear, yet these
&gt; skeptics would have us all believe we are completely delusional. Science is
&gt; dusty old men sitting around a fireplace in leather chairs telling each
&gt; other how smart they are. Thing is, they create all their precious evidence
&gt; as well. First they theorize, then they discover.
