If you can&#39;t hear them then it must be =\r\n\n  either mechanical (sound card or headphones)or maybe your hearing has lo=\r\nss in \n  those frequencies.&lt;WBR&gt;...Some of these are not very clear or loud=\r\n enough too. \n  But many will depend on your computer sound card &amp; your=\r\n headphones. I have \n  let an older man listen (in his late 60&#39;s) and he ha=\r\ns heard most all of the \n  audio. Same with a few guys at work. Some hear t=\r\nhem right away, and others \n  can&#39;t until I loop the actually EVP for a few=\r\n tries. I personally use a Dell \n  Latitude D430 to hear these. I can hear =\r\nsome on my cell phone. Headphones are \n  a must....or you won&#39;t hear anythi=\r\nng either way. *But some can be heard on \n  cell phone without headphones. =\r\nThe conversion to MP3 has also caused some \n  loss, but I am still able to =\r\nhear them when I review from this site (but I \n  have the repetive hearing =\r\nsyndrome in this area no doubt). Although I do have \n  some disbelief (shoc=\r\nk) that a few of these are not discernable. Go back and \n  listen to &quot;tomor=\r\nrow let you know&quot; is in a gruffy-robotic melodic tone at the \n  very end bu=\r\nt with higher natural volume. And if you couldn&#39;t hear the \n  whistle...I w=\r\nould suggest the need to remove the cotton from the ear :) As for \n  feedba=\r\nck....&lt;WBR&gt;.feedback from what? I only had one recorder working here. I \n  =\r\nwould rather hear someone say &quot;I&quot; made the whistle....that would be more \n =\r\n understandable. And is very true....if someone &quot;tells&quot; the group that THIS=\r\n is \n  supposed to be what WAS said, then is very difficult to clear the mi=\r\nnd to hear \n  it any other way. Kinda like trying to hum another song while=\r\n a different one \n  is playing :) --- In &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yah=\r\noogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, \n  &quot;April Abercrombie&quot; &lt;=\r\napril@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s the \n  thing though - if=\r\n you put something out there, and ask people to listen to it, \n  your invit=\r\ning opinions.

I=\r\n \n  said 16 (my earlier age I was saying in recorder) and the male evp said=\r\n \n  13....then a female laughs. All this was missed by the DR60 (except my =\r\n16 was \n  recorded in both recorders) BUT then the DR60 &quot;caught&quot; the B7 &quot;na=\r\npping&quot; at \n  near the end of the 5 second clip....the DR60 heard &quot;let me ou=\r\nt&quot; in a clear \n  (quite) males voice.
