Hey, you know what, maybe they did, I and other's still living at the time  
heard their message, last time was 1968, then she died in spring 1974,  she 
lived with a pace maker, and had angina just about all her life, yet she  
never missed a Sunday, had to take the nitro under the tongue every now and  
then, but spirit used her mightily.  At the time she died, their were only  
11 people still alive that went to that church, now, their is only her 
remaining  family, who have kept all the recorded sermons, over 2000 of them, 
they use to  tape her semons every sunday, using the reel to reel old 
fashioned.  One of  her grandson's put them all on the more mondern tape's I think, I 
rarely ever  hear from them, the son is up in age now, as is his wife, and 
I think I am the  only one still on this side that went to that Church, wish 
I could find a  kindred soul, doesn't seem to be anyone left.  If I can 
find something that  work's I will love nothing better then to jump on the band 
wagon with all  of you folks.  Thanks for asking, sf

Says, they are now doing "real  time" research, the person that started 
this should have got a patten  for it, because I got news for you folks, this 
is the real deal!   What you are all working on now, was predicted by Spirit 
way back in  the 30's, 60's, they told us via Rev. Lillian Lee from MI, now 
crossed  over, someone should try to ask for her, I am sure she would love 
to  speak in these groups.  She was an elderly lady, Christian  Spiritualist 
that was the real deal, she got direct voice, and  materializion'that was 
the real deal, she got direct voice, and  materializion'<WBR>s, independent 
voice (  them).  She was  in her mid 80's when she crossed, she was top in her 
gifts.  If  you guys can bring her in you will get Angels as well, so keep 
that in  mind, and when they come through, any "dark forces" will vanish, I 
can  guarantee that so,  see if you can bring her through.  We  were told by 
spirit there would (one day be something that could be  worn on the wrist 
or carried, where people will be able to talk with  their loved ones on the 
other side.) we were given a time frame of 25  years or so for people to 
start to develop this, it would be a time of  "cell" back then there were no 
computers, or even having them.   Things have really started to move quickly 
since the start of 1900's,  over the past 100 years society has moved forward 
with lightening  speed on everything almost.   sf
