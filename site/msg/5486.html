Hey Bruce, I didn't mean to come across annoyed or of=

Nick, You are a new member and a possible researcher so I do not want =

 researchers that believe it is beneficial to leave a box running and unatt=

 That is not at all necessary, Spirit techs do need to imprint to certain b=
oxes but do so through two way communicationyou see they also imprint the e=

 the absent session practice definitely contributes to the ultimate failure=

ractices in the beginning that will serve to enhance your communication ski=

 theother side but they will become your trusted friends and protectors. yo=
u would never leave your buddy on the phone and go on to something else whi=

as preaching or criticism it is just experience from communicating with my =
own techs and friendsand gathering information on what they feel and expect=
 from us as researchers.Remember all we have to do is turn on a box and lis=
ten and record their job to send the communication no matter how short the =
phrase or word is a 1000x harder for them so don't you think they deserve a=
 100% of our attention when we open the lines of communication. Also in clo=
sing let me say that my belief on "imprinting" of a box is for boxes like F=
rank's box and the mini box, for the simplereason that they are individuall=
y made and each carry a slightly different frequency range, indicative to t=

ed in china most likely on an automated assembly line so eachcircuit board =
is exactly like the next, this being the case I believe that when our frien=

others. That is why people experience immediate communication right out of =
the box. So therefore the RS box does not need that grace period to "Imprin=

Jus=

On Jan 8, 2008, at 9:19 AM, bruce halliday w=
rote:




Nick, My advice as a long time researcher is not to just turn the=
 box on and leave it running unless you intend to do a session and give you=
r friends on the other side that are workingextremely hard to send you the =
communication your undivided attention. It's kind of like calling someone o=
n the phone and when they start a conversation you decide toput the phone d=
own and focus your attention on other things. There are other researchers t=
hat feel that there is nothing wrong with this practice and do it on occasi=
onBut I have come to the understanding that it is deemed disrespectful and =
while you may be listening with one ear as you do something else, you will =
hear a loud curse word or nasty statement, that is their way of getting you=
r attention back. I have gotten numerous messages about the difficulty of t=
he attempts for them to communicate so when I turn the box on it gets my fu=
ll attention. just some experienced advice. As for them telling you to clos=
e the portal, it could have two meanings. Sometimes they refer to box thati=
s turned on and in use as a portal for the simple reason that each time we =
turn a box on to communicate it opens a direct open link between our realm =
and theirs so in essence it is an open door for anything to pass in or out.=
 that is why when I end a session I always ask my technician to bring back =
any spirits that may have come through the portal during the session and I =
ask for conformation and 10 times out of ten will get "OK" or "OK THEY ARE =
BACK" also they may have meant since you had the box running and where not =
doing a actual session to shut the box so that they could go and not have t=
o protect the open connection from any negative entities that where able cr=
oss through the openportal. A few researchers have been receiving numerous =
messages about the number 7 within the past month. The only known significa=
nce that the number 7 has in evp research is the 7 entities that controlled=
 communication back in the eighties and ninetiesduring the spiricom and lux=
embourg era. To receive this number in messages so often and by more than o=
ne researcher, odiouslyholds some importance which they have not been able =
or are not ready to convey. If you need any help or have any questions plea=
se feel free to ask. Bruce
