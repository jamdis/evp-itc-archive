&gt; I would say that maybe 2 out of 10 sessions you will get
&gt; a session that is just spot on, everything comes through
&gt; clear and the answers all make sense. That allows for us
&gt; to harvest quite a bit of really good files from the recording.
&gt;
&gt; The buddhist alter the protection prayer the crystal, they
&gt; may not help but they sure can&#x27;t hurt!
&gt;
&gt; You are becoming quite a good researcher, keep it up.

&gt; Yeah--it&#x27;s the the minibox. Everything I posted so far tonight was  
&gt; in the first 1 minute of turning it on. I haven&#x27;t even gotten  
&gt; midway through listening to it and realized this is another one of  
&gt; those sessions where things were bang on and I could post dozens of  
&gt; files. Wow.
&gt;
&gt; Bruce, I think you&#x27;ll be pleased to know that I lit my Buddhist  
&gt; altar and did a protection prayer first. :)
&gt;
&gt; And I put a quartz crystal on top of the box to boot.
&gt;
&gt; Hedging all my bets today!
