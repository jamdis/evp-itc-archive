Some tuners have different sweep requirements for each band, so\nsometimes have to add a pot to adjust the max level for one of the bands.\nAM=530 to 1710 Khz and FM 88.5 to 108mhz, but you don&#39;t have to cover the\nentire band, all that is required is enough to provide the raw audio bits\nthe entities use to make their voices.\n\n A Danish researcher back in the 80s was just &quot;wobbling&quot; between a couple\nstations to make contact. His name was Stein and there&#39;s more info on the\nGerman VTF site. Stein also has his sweep circuit there.\n\n The best sounding systems seem to be the way Steve Hultay makes his, by\nadding sweep to a complete radio. see keyportparanormal.com. I take the\ntuners out of the radio, and supply my own amplifier and sweep. At present\nI&#39;m making a box using a Timex clock radio tuner, the triangle sweep, and\ncomputer sound amplifier and speaker system for the bass response. I just\nstarted this project yesterday. I use Timex model T309T AM/FM/nature sounds\nclock radios when I can find them in thrift stores cheap. I found a Timex\nmodel T313T this morning, and hoping it has the seperate tuner board inside,\nas the 300 series has so far.\n\n I used to use car stereo tuner modules, but those tend to be too noisy. Box\n13, that Hultay just got back is based on a car tuner. He did a YouTube\nvideo of it.\n\n I&#39;m still pretty much an amateur at this, there are so many variables.\n\n Frank-S\n\nOn Fri, Aug 20, 2010 at 6:35 PM, Luis &lt;luispucp098@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am very glad for your atention Frank , i will make a box and i need it be\n&gt; very good , for best results .

With just a\n&gt; long\n&gt; &gt; straight tube the sound tends to be tinny.

With the hack\n&gt; radio\n&gt; &gt; the sweep steps so the radio is tuned in 10khz increments.
