I see your point, Tim, however,  I had not asked that question  directly 
u=
ntil after someone said something to me.   I asked only  to clarify somethi=

that was said earlier.  True, we do attract certain  people  to each of=

you are attracting various types because you seem to  be one of those=
 doing 
the safe middle of the road system when it comes to  faith or relig=

that we all come from different schools of thought.  sf
