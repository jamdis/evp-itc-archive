<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I can&#x27;t remember:  Did they ever explain to you why they call you Purple?  Could this be the color of your aura or something?  If so, maybe they really can &quot;see&quot; us and our surroundings, and not just read our minds and see the world through our eyes?

&gt;  So far, I have not heard of anyone else being told they are &quot;The Princess&quot;
&gt; or &quot;Purple&quot;, so I think we do have our own groups, plus normal spirits that
&gt; communicate. I get a bgi mix of different voices and entities.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for answering me, because I was wondering if the &quot;I love yous&quot; were
&gt; &gt; something characteristic of just the entities I&#x27;m talking to (maybe even the
&gt; &gt; same entity over and over again), or characteristic of most entities in
&gt; &gt; general -- like they have different priorities on what constitutes an
&gt; &gt; important message once a person has died. For instance, my father I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; certain would&#x27;ve told me to move the trees I&#x27;d planted over the septic tank,
&gt; &gt; but would&#x27;ve never said &quot;I love you.&quot; Maybe once he&#x27;s dead, everything looks
&gt; &gt; different to him? (That&#x27;s providing I&#x27;m really talking to dead people, which
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m starting to wonder about.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m also noticing a tendency for the names I&#x27;m getting lately to be
&gt; &gt; Biblical: Joseph and Michael have come through strongly, and I have no clue
&gt; &gt; who they are. Maybe they make a name in order to talk to me?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve also been reading more about how there can be seemingly different
&gt; &gt; groups of entities competing to talk:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://othersidecommunications.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=11
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I witnessed this, I think, myself when my uncle came through (giving
&gt; &gt; supporting evidence that it truly was him) and I also heard someone say &quot;Get
&gt; &gt; away from me.&quot; So maybe our dead relatives are indeed there, but other
&gt; &gt; entities, wanting to hog the spotlight, get in the way or skew what our dead
&gt; &gt; relatives say? Just a thought.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I get those two. I rarely get last names. names have menaing on this
&gt; &gt; level,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but none of us are the same person in death, this is just one existence,
&gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; label or name, or gender, or species(?)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I&#x27;m guessing no one else here gets &quot;I love you&quot; from the entities?
&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just me? (I&#x27;m just that loveable?)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On New Year&#x27;s Eve and New Year&#x27;s Day I did two sessions with two
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different sets of participants. The messages always seem to be the
&gt; &gt; same,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though: &quot;I love you.&quot; Over and over, threading all through the
&gt; &gt; recording,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both in the background, and more overtly when I ask a specific question
&gt; &gt; such
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as, &quot;Do you have a message for Heather?&quot; Does anyone else get this? I
&gt; &gt; mean,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it&#x27;s flattering and all, but it doesn&#x27;t really mean that much when I
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know for sure who&#x27;s telling me this.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, &quot;they&quot; seem quite ready to tell me their first names, but
&gt; &gt; almost
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never their last names. Why? Do last names cease to exist on the other
&gt; &gt; side?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or is there some unwritten rule that says verifiable information can&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; passed along? If so, who makes and enforces these rules?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if they can so easily say a name four times in a row (yesterday
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was my friend&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s name Donald), why can&#x27;t they say one word
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me that would mean something? Or to my friend Heather? We both asked,
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got nothing, at least not that we could discern. It would seem a simple
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing to say the word plumber (that was my dad&#x27;s secret word) or some
&gt; &gt; other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; single-syllable word. Now I&#x27;m pretty sure I really did talk to my dad,
&gt; &gt; as I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had another &quot;contact&quot; from him in my waking dream state the other
&gt; &gt; morning,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but if it&#x27;s really him, why can&#x27;t he say something he would&#x27;ve said in
&gt; &gt; life?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why do I have the nagging feeling that &quot;they&quot; aren&#x27;t human and never
&gt; &gt; were?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just don&#x27;t get it! Any thoughts, guys?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
