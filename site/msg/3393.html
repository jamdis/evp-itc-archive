<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>LOL!

Talking to a hot ghost isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d be opposed to... but good 
dialog with others is a boon no matter what they look like.

&gt;            I&#x27;m torqued again! I was told yesterday by ------if ya 
believe that horse crap,  that what we are getting is &#x27;false 
communication&#x27;. Not only that, that we are only getting the &#x27;bad 
guys&#x27;. So which is it, false communication, which is no 
commnunication, or is it evil spirits. To make it worse, this idiot 
implies he has the backing of the -------, and the church believes we 
are letting evil into the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;  I took this as a severe slap to the face, very insulting to me, 
and every paranormal researcher in the world. He claims the &#x27;real 
voices&#x27; he gets are made out of white noise combined with broadcast 
fragments. Duffus!! That is exactly the kind of voices the living 
mind creates to get the voices it wants to hear. Yet only his are the 
real voices! My old friend, you can take your &#x27;serious session&#x27; and 
your bishop, and shove &#x27;em. 
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  My apoplogies to the group, but I know this will get forwarded, 
and this bozo finds me so easy to dismiss, that normal e-mail would 
be useless. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I had to cut some out for nice sakes.
