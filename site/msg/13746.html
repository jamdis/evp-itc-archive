Well, if my husband would let me actually experiment with one, that would b=
e the first step LOL!

But what I would try and do is get some kind of veri=
fiable information from the "entity" that I contact with the board to prove=
 that it is communication from an actual, intelligent being and not just my=
 own motor responses making he planchette move. It would have to be informa=
tion that I have no knowledge of.

If I could do that, and consistently, th=
en I would be comfortable saying that I am actually talking to a spirit.

T=
he reason I have my doubts is that you have to be touching the planchette t=
o get it to move. If it were an actual spirit, I would think that shouldn't=
 be necessary. We all know ghosts can a do move objects.

But this brings u=
p another mystery - if the Ouija board is actual spirit communication, mayb=
e there is a difference between the entities you can contact with it and yo=
ur common ghost.

  When it come=
s to the Ouija, I just want to study it to find out if it is really spirit =
communication, or just kinetic energy or your subconscious mind moving the =
planchette.

  I agree that we all have the ability for extra sensory perce=
ption, just some are better at it than others. Like running, for instance. =
We all can run, but some are naturally better at it. Still, with practice w=
e can get better.

  But that is not my aim with the Ouija.
