Hi All;
 
 I met with Moon last night, and it wa=
s unbelievably positive, like coming home. I did not expect that. Not only =
that, his little blue box working like I wanted all the boxes since to work=
, but couldn't figure out how to it get back to that.
 
 The=
 first step is to rework the RVG, random mode. I think that's part of it, a=
nd I think the rest is the operator. I'm not saying it has to be rando=
m, cuz linear clearly works, but I think there's conditions, or levels=
 on the other side where the random mode is required. I have made progress =
with the audio, making it louder, but the trade off is shorter battery life=
. 
 
 I forget the model number, but the little RS round AM/FM ra=
dio is hackable, and usable on external sweep. Just checked radioshack.com,=
 it's the 12-820 arm band radio, it has the VT pin, and that is an analog v=
oltage. Thanks to Steve for that!
 
  I re-checked the 12-470, an=
d it does use digital pulses on the VT pin, but it's converted to an analog=
 voltage on the radio board, but---it uses 4 to 8 volts for FM, and 0 to 8 =
volts for AM tuning, so I'd have to do some level shifting to use AM and FM=
, as well as slowing the sweep to half speed on FM, since it's converi=
ng half the range--I think. I think the older 12-470 is usable as is, since=
 it does not have the annoying clicking.
