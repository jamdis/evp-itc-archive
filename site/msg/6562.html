&gt; I&#x27;m being a good girl and posting mp3s. I&#x27;ve gone and deleted some  
&gt; files well. If you need more to delete more, let me know!

&gt; &gt; Yep Steve you are right. I have even tried emailing a few people  
&gt; &gt; programs to easily convert them to no avail. Some people just 
want  
&gt; &gt; to ignore what is being said but soon they will have no choice 
but  
&gt; &gt; to listen.

&gt; &gt; Misty,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have and idea. One solution is to post Mp3 files instead of Wav.
&gt; &gt; files or any other format. It seems like the Mp3&#x27;s sound the same
&gt; &gt; and are only 1/10th of the size. I think that would probably clear
&gt; &gt; up 90 percent of the board right there. If i actually have more 
than
&gt; &gt; a couple files from here on out, i will be attaching them to an e-
&gt; &gt; mail and not the board to save space here. And also, if people do
&gt; &gt; post files maybe we can all just have one post that says we have
&gt; &gt; uploaded files to our folder instead of 30 audio announcements in 
a
&gt; &gt; row that just seems to waste a lot of e-mail space in the 
individual
&gt; &gt; e-mails. And it also pushes the current topic on the board to
&gt; &gt; another page and is lost for those who wanted to share. Just my
&gt; &gt; thoughts on helping the subject. I know we are all excited, but
&gt; &gt; misty is right. I went to add a file the other day and the group 
was
&gt; &gt; at 93 percent capacity, so it won&#x27;t be long before we run out of
&gt; &gt; space.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just a little friendly reminder that you all need to organize 
your
&gt; &gt; &gt; files better in the files area. Space is limited here and you 
are
&gt; &gt; all
&gt; &gt; &gt; nearing the 100% mark so try to keep your section under 5 megs. 
If
&gt; &gt; &gt; you need more space use www.esnips.com and you can store 50 
gigs to
&gt; &gt; &gt; share with the group or public.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it is great you guys have so much to share I just wish 
that
&gt; &gt; &gt; our yahoo group wasnt so limited on space (and that I wasnt so
&gt; &gt; &gt; limited on time). But I have found a way around it. If just a 
few
&gt; &gt; &gt; people signed up and shared using esnips they can invite others 
to
&gt; &gt; &gt; visit thier files and once they do they also get 50 gigs of free
&gt; &gt; &gt; space for audio pictures or video or whatever you want to post.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was considering setting up one &quot;group&quot; account to start with 
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; inviting all members who post files to join it and be able to 
post
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the account. It will automatically notify everyone thats a 
member
&gt; &gt; &gt; when a file is added to it just like the yahoo group does. It 
also
&gt; &gt; &gt; allows you to share with the public or privately if you so 
choose.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You can even allow your friends to post to your account if you 
wish.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This group has grown and expanded and we just need to make a few
&gt; &gt; &gt; changes to how we do things to keep it running more smoothly for
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; future. I am hoping that you all will help me in this endeavor. 
I
&gt; &gt; &gt; know many of you have already adapted the idea to help us 
organize
&gt; &gt; &gt; and maintain the group.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I want you to keep sharing and to be able to share more!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So please organize and not post stray files that are targets for
&gt; &gt; &gt; deletion once the que is 100% full. And for your own sake, if no
&gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; elses, be respectful to each other.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! 
Mobile.  
&gt; &gt; Try it now.
