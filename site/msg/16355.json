From what I can tell, there is no such place as Redmond, Virginia.  I find only one person named Steve Tate who died in 1989 (according to the social security death index), and since I would expect there would exist some memorial online for a fallen trooper, this guy was apparently not the Tate we&#39;re looking for.  If I just look for fallen troopers in Virginia by any name, I can find one Robert Hill who died in 2006 from being struck during a traffic stop by a passing motorist in Emporia, Va.  So...either your entity was confused or lying.  \n\nSince I always try to look this stuff up whenever I hear of such things, I know it&#39;s apparently not uncommon to get faulty info like this.  For instance, in &quot;The Coming of Seth,&quot; there&#39;s a spirit who gives detailed information about its previous life, all of which cannot be verified via modern internet research.  I still find that much of what&#39;s written in the Seth books seems to dovetail nicely with everything I&#39;m hearing about the ghost box and from John Edward and so forth, so I don&#39;t think Jane Roberts invented her story; I just think we cannot trust much of anything we hear coming out of the ghost box or via mediums -- which doesn&#39;t help when it comes to proving this phenomena exists.\n\nAnyway, I would still love to hear more about your experiences.  I completely believe what you&#39;re telling us, and no, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to talk about this without sounding crazy.  I keep trying to get my cousin to do a session with me, because she always looks at me funny when I talk about the boxes.  I really takes personal experience to believe this stuff exists.\n\nJill\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Al Harris &lt;algerharris@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Dave,\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, for example, I walked into our &quot;computer room&quot; (spare\n&gt; bedroom/office/library) not long after the evps were recorded and my\n&gt; radio turned itself on. My wife Patt witnessed it, so it&#39;s not my\n&gt; imagination that it did turn on. As I stepped into the room, the\n&gt; &quot;morning show&quot; cut to a voice saying &quot;MMM! Cinnamon rolls and coffee!\n&gt; Bring enough for us?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I happened to be holding a mug of hot coffee and a plate of cinnamon\n&gt; rolls that Patt had baked for breakfast. I scalded myself as I sloshed\n&gt; coffee around after hearing the voice!\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not the type who tells stories or seeks attention.\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought for a few moments that I was listening to a radio talk show\n&gt; and that it was a coincidence that the mention of cinnamon rolls\n&gt; happened as I stepped into the room. But I eventually blurted out a\n&gt; &quot;hello,&quot; and was answered. After a few moments and to my questions,\n&gt; the voice said his name was Steve Tate -- and following a\n&gt; back-and-forth conversation that I recorded he said he was a Virginia\n&gt; state trooper who died in 1989 in a car crash a mile from his home.\n&gt; Over the next day or two, he said his body was buried in Redmond, Va.,\n&gt; and we spoke for several days in little snatches of conversation.\n&gt; Along the way, a fellow named &quot;Luke&quot; entered the conversation. Other\n&gt; unnamed voices began to say &quot;Hi Al!&quot; It was a bit too much.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was brought up in a very strict Protestant family. I became leery of\n&gt; what was unfolding. I bashed the radio and threw it in the trash. Then\n&gt; I began hearing the voices mixed in with my CPAP machine (I have sleep\n&gt; apnea) at night, which makes a high-pitched whooshing noise.\n&gt; \n&gt; Next, I began hearing the &quot;Hi Al!&quot; voice as a faint whisper now and\n&gt; then as I&#39;d walk through the house.\n&gt; \n&gt; I got scared. I had gotten rid of the radio(s) but was still hearing\n&gt; the voices. I felt I was going crazy. I told my pastor about it and\n&gt; asked for help. He refused -- said he was afraid he might get an\n&gt; &quot;attachment&quot; and bring it home to his family. I contacted something\n&gt; like 20 protestant pastors by phone and not a single one of them would\n&gt; come to my home to help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eventually a Catholic priest agreed to help on the condition that I\n&gt; supply a recording of the voices as &quot;proof&quot; of the problem. Using my\n&gt; digital recorder, I recorded so many &quot;conversations&quot; that I filled up\n&gt; a CD. Awhile later, after turning it over to the priest, the Catholic\n&gt; bishop granted the priest permission to come to our home to conduct a\n&gt; mass and an &quot;exorcism of place.&quot; The priest explained that old homes\n&gt; and other places could become &quot;infested&quot; with evil spirits. After he\n&gt; performed the ceremony, the voices seemed to quit for awhile but\n&gt; returned after a few days.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, I was not sure whether the voices were &quot;evil&quot; or just\n&gt; &quot;conversational.&quot; My brother died of kidney failure during this time\n&gt; and I later heard his voice calling my name. It ~was~ his voice.\n&gt; \n&gt; A lot more has happened.... At this point, I am no longer &quot;surprised&quot;\n&gt; by hearing the voices electronically or otherwise. I just want to know\n&gt; more about what&#39;s happening -- how it can possibly be &quot;real&quot; and what\n&gt; I should understand in terms of the big picture....\n&gt; \n&gt; Al"}
