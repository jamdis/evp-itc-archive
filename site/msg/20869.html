By Jove, how does Juno feel about that?

&gt;  I tried calling you on Skype Steve so I could play the file for you, but you are not answering the Skype phone, I am willing to play the file, maybe it has something to do with the sound players or something.

&gt;    I know, I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s so hard for humans to solve our own problems, yet they seem to know all about other planets, I think greed has a lot to do with it though.  Cool clips of Jupiter turning, NASA clips.

&gt;   Does anyone hear that file i just sent?  I need to have someone else hear it, please, and don&#x27;t lie, if you can&#x27;t hear, then get with me on Skype, and I will play it for you Steve. sf

&gt;                                                            Why is it that science can figure out that Jupiter.... JUPITER!.... a frazillion miles away is shrinking by 2 dinkymeters a year, but they can&#x27;t put their heads together to solve world hunger, and other more pressing problems.... sorry, snow I don&#x27;t want to take away from your post, I just had to get that off my chest....

&gt;    &gt; Interesting things about Jupiter:  &quot;Although Jupiter would need to be  
&gt;    &gt; about 75 times as massive to fuse hydrogen and become a _star_ 
&gt;    &gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) , the smallest _red dwarf_ 
&gt;    &gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf)  is only about 30  percent larger in radius than Jupiter._[27]_ 
&gt;    &gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter#cite_note-26) _[28]_ 
&gt;    &gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter#cite_note-27)   Despite this, Jupiter still radiates 
&gt;    &gt; more heat than it receives from the Sun.  The amount of heat produced inside 
&gt;    &gt; the planet is nearly equal to the total _solar radiation_ 
&gt;    &gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation)  it  receives._[29]_ 
&gt;    &gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter#cite_note-elkins-tanton-28)   This additional heat radiation is 
&gt;    &gt; generated by the _Kelvin-Helmholtz  mechanism_ 
&gt;    &gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin-Helmholtz_mechanism)  through _adiabatic_ 
&gt;    &gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_process)  contraction.  This process results in the planet 
&gt;    &gt; shrinking by about 2 cm each year._[30]_ 
&gt;    &gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter#cite_note-guillot04-29)   When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter 
&gt;    &gt; and was about twice its  current diameter._[31]_ 
&gt;    &gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter#cite_note-30) &quot;
