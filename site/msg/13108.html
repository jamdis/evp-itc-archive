You also need a device to act in a nonlinear fashion. Transistor junctions 
and diodes do this well.  Fortunately (for us), the devices used at audio 
frequencies have a limited frequency range where they would do anything. A 
signal at an AM frequency is most likely to interact and possibly an FM 
frequency signal will interact. UHF and microwave signals are probably out 
of the range where these devices will do anything.

Try to get diodes that work at millimeter-wave frequencies!  They are 
difficult to find and rather expensive. $50 - $100 for one diode is not 
uncommon.
