I don&#39;t get on here too often cause I do alot of Paranormal Investigations and is alsways going over evidence for our group S.P.I.R.I.T. Paranormal Investigation Team here in Pennsylvania. I&#39;ll be at the Queen Mary event\nand I&#39;m also going to do the USS North Carolina Battleship in Nov. I was just wondering if you were bringing any of your boxes to the event for purchase ? Even if the ones you bring are the noisy ones. Have you tried using a Infrared strobe light when using your boxes and did you get better results with them ? Will you demonstrate the video franks Box there at the event ? That sounds very interesting. Have had much luck with it? Hope to see you there at the Quenn Mary Misty said there will be many people there from this website. Take care Frank and I hope you have a great time at the Queen Mary. Can&#39;t wait to do some experiments there with my gear. See ya Frank. Keep up the great work too.\n\nRegards,\n\nRalph L. Smith\nS.P.I.R.I.T.
