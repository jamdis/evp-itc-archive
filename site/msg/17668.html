<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Made this last night #80. The tuner is from an Aiwa after market car stereo
made in 1998. It has/had built in secturity, which means I might not have
been able to power up this radio. I bought it for $3 cuz I could see the
tuner module pins were labeled, so it was a piece of cake to remove the
tuner and mak it work. Car tuners are getting very few and far between in
the thrift stores, and worse at junk yards. This is what I started with in
the first boxes. It was Bill Chaple that &quot;discovered&quot; the hack radios, and I
was  like DAH!! you mean you can use other radios! I can be very dense--and
narrow.
