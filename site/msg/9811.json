They do however allow you to add and amending statement.\n\nWhich I have done In Big Bold Red Letters, the price listing was a \nmistake. I am certainly not trying to misrepresent the item or make a \nprofit on it.\n\nI have also lowered the reserve price on it as a result of the \nmistake.\nBelieve me I will be taking a loss on the box.\n\nI have already sent my apologies to Rick Moran from Paranormal \nsystems.\n\nAnd now extend my apologies for the mistake to anyone that was \ninterested in it.\n\nThe reason for selling the MB was not the money, it was the guilt of \nhaving this excellent piece of equipment go without the attention it \ndeserves. And the hopes that someone or some group can utilize it \nmore than myself.\n\nBut I could not as much as I would have liked to, give it away.\nMy intention was to get back at least a decent amount of my \ninvestment.\n\nI hope no one gets the wrong idea and thinks ill of me.\n\nBruce"}
