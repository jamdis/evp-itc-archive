Well as a great lover of Radio Shack's various projects (150 in 1 was my fa=
ve), I'm pretty sure you will not be able to build a sweeping AM radio from=
 that.  Sorry.  But they are great to learn basic principles from.

Also wh=
ile the jury is still out on whether or not free energy machines exist, it =
is definitely not going to be able to be built using a radio shack learning=
 lab.  Otherwise everyone would have one by now and we would not need the p=
ower companies.

Don

I am too intrested in makin=
g my own box. I recieved my Radio Shack Electronics Learning Lab just a las=
t week from EBay http://cgi.ebay. com/BRAND- NEW-ELECTRONICS- LEARNING- LAB=
-RADIO- SHACK-28- 280_W0QQitemZ150 404642293QQcmdZV iewItemQQptZLH_ Default=
Domain_ 0?hash=3Ditem2304d 0b5f5#shId.
I believe I can learn electronics us=
ing this kit and YouTube videos.
I am following a video lesson course on ho=
w to use the Electronics leaning Lab on YouTube Here's the Link: http://www=
.youtube. com/watch? v=3DxGHjd88ASNM&feature=3Dfvw
I hope using this electr=
onics kit I can learn to make a box out of it so anyone who knows electroni=
cs or this kit will believe and can make something like a ghost radio box. =
I also believe I can try to make a few different boxs out of this kit. But =
does anyone have the diagrames? or the chips/parts? Videos on how too are g=
ood also.
 
I also would like to try to make my Eletronics learning Lab int=
o a free energy device. Does any one have any plans on that?
Here's a YouTu=
be video on that: http://www.youtube. com/watch? v=3DEe9uYqFb- OI
 
Thanks.=
