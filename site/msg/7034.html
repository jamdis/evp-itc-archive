&gt; I love the sharing of info, but have elected to post less and 
retire

&gt; 
&gt; That said, I must agree with Ann that the initial post, though 
&gt; perhaps posted to be humorous, came off as disrespectful (in my 
&gt; opinion as a reader looking in on this forum) not only to BH but to 
&gt; FS.  BH does get animated at times, but he also brings some good 
&gt; input in here, too. 
&gt; 
&gt; We need to learn how to get along and work together.  Look at your 
&gt; initial post from someone else&#x27;s point of view and unban the poor 
&gt; fella&#x27;, won&#x27;t ya&#x27;?  ;)

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I brought up a point in a lighthearted way, and it was NOT 
ABUSIVE, 
&gt; but
&gt; &gt; being abusive and attacking and degrading ones character is a 
&gt; totally
&gt; &gt; different scenario. There are 3 Mod&#x27;s on the board, and we 
discuss, 
&gt; before
&gt; &gt; choices are made. I am sorry if you are feeling conflict with is 
&gt; forum, if
&gt; &gt; your unhappy and want to un-join the choice is yours, we would 
&gt; certainly
&gt; &gt; hope you will re consider and have a better attitude with more 
&gt; harmony and
&gt; &gt; respect to all that post without defamation of character and 
abusive
&gt; &gt; language.

&gt; &gt; The person who began the issue with an offensive comment of her 
own

&gt; &gt; ought not to be the one suspending Bruce for responding to it. My

&gt; &gt; Your milage may vary.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Misty, this is a decision for a list owner. I think that is you 
and

&gt; &gt; Jeff,
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Mind your buisness and go back to the kiddie table.
&gt; &gt; your not supposed to get involved in real peoples conversations.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; before you open your mouth read the post that this post was in 
&gt; reply too.
&gt; &gt; who are you to suggest anything, when was the last time anybody
&gt; &gt; saw any research or files from you? OOPS I forget nobody EVER did.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Stop sticking your mouth where it does not belong.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That lost comment was uncalled for and extremely rude.  If you

&gt; &gt; DON&quot;T BE HATIN!!
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; First off the reason I got a new box From Frank is because he 
&gt; recognises
&gt; &gt; that 
&gt; &gt; I am a serious researcher, It does not have anything to do with 
&gt; being a man 
&gt; &gt; or woman. It has to do with being deserving of a Frank&#x27;s box and 
&gt; evidently!
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Well do I have to spell it out? Start putting some time into your 
&gt; research
&gt; &gt; instead of
&gt; &gt; taking tantrums and maybe someday you&#x27;ll have a Frank&#x27;s box, But 
I 
&gt; doubt it!

&gt; &gt; hey guy&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have been lucky enough to not only have Frank&#x27;s box #12 but now 
&gt; Frank 
&gt; &gt; has gifted me with a brand new box #29.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here are the first files to come out of it. And it has not even 
&gt; been 
&gt; &gt; imprinted by mike and lisa yet. These files are from the first 30 
&gt; &gt; seconds of the first session.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; let me know what you think.
