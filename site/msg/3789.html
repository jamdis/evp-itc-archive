<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Frank,

Could you please elaborate on &quot;reversing decks&quot;? 

I use Cool Edit Pro to import, analyze, and save my EVPs. It is 
capable of reversals of the wave form, isn&#x27;t it? And is it as simple 
as that?

Thank You,
Lance

&gt; I have &quot;reversing decks&quot; and I do it on the computer with normal 
speech, and EVP. It&#x27;s as real as anything else.

&gt; Kewl!Who knows... I&#x27;m not totally convinced on Reverse Speech 
either. But then I suppose trying as many different things as we are 
inspired to is a good thing.Lance--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,

intuition hits to reverse a voice, or phrase. I don&#x27;t use it on 
everything, but there is often a reverse component. &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt; &gt; &gt;

What about reverse speech?Has anyone considered trying to use this 
technique with voice recordings from the boxes? Lance--- In EVP-
ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, 
I can tell where that theory came from! It&#x27;s been my experience, they 
use what we use, as long as it&#x27;s something they can form voices out 
of. It&#x27;s also been my experience that the combo noise/frag voice is 
what our own minds create. I suggest you play with EVPmaker, with 
clear raw audio, you&#x27;ll find no white noise needed. &gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t get 
any mention of technicians, or anykind of helper/operators on the 
other side. They sometimes talk about a network, but I couldn&#x27;t tell 
you what that is, or if it&#x27;s real. &gt; &gt; I think it&#x27;s 99.99%PK. So not 
only do spirits, and other entities make voices, we can do it to, 
mostly unconciuosly. &gt; &gt; Moon is still certain that it has to be 
random, despite the last several months of experiments that show the 
linear mode is far superior. &gt; &gt; If someone could take a digital 
speech recordng, stored in memory, and chop it up, and play it back 
over a speaker, I think it would work just as well as radio. You 
could get live voices, answers to questions, and never replace the 
raw audio. This is in fact EVPmaker, but it would be nice to have it 
portable. EVPmaker pretty much took all the mystery out of this, and 
it&#x27;s all but igonred. My system, and analog version of EVPmaker using 
technologies I had worked wiht in the past. My mind did kind of 
assemble all the elements, so I got an image of the complete system. 
&gt; &gt; I thought I knew how the voices in my boxes worked at one 
time..now I have no idea!&gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@:

Some new additions for the 12-470... I hope&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Excuse me if I 
mispell some things in this post, I&#x27;m currently running the 
production board for a LIVE internet radion program going on right 
now, and I&#x27;m doing 100 things at once!Okay... According to 
some, &quot;...the Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides on the other side 
have repeatedly explained that the way that the Telephone to the Dead 
technology works, is by spirit energy manipulating the random voltage 
generator (RVG) and using white and pink noise, as well as radio 
fragment, to create real time voice answers to questions posed from 
our side. The most important aspect to this device is the medium 
operator who works as an antenna or &quot;interpreter&quot; for living 
individuals asking the questions.&quot;So, that said (or copied and 
pasted) I have decided that my next attempt with the older version of 
the 12-470 will be the following:1) Add a method of variable voltage 
used to adjust the tuning circuit, similar to the RVG mentioned 
above. I went out and purchased another older 12-470 today, to do 
just this.(Frank... I did some measurements of that VT and found a 
range to work with.. I hope!)2) Add that white or pink noise to be 
mixed with the sweeping raw audio already available from the modified 
12-470.3) Add an internal antenna for the 12-470.4) Add an interface 
so the user will be a active/passive part of the radio. As mentioned 
above, as the antenna between the entities/spirits.So... if I can 
accomplish all that... maybe the little ole&#x27; 12-470 will be 
recognized by the &quot;experts&quot;, as having what the big mahcines now 
have... :-)Wish me luck in my adventure... and oh, by-the-way... I 
hope to add all this, inside the existing case.- Mike &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
