I kinda loose track of dates/times when I stay up all night. This is the wood box with the car tuner.  
 
 BTW, so far these wood boxes are unique in that one is an AM/FM car tuner, which(good ones) are hard to come by these days, and the other is a Radio Shack super hack, as I call it. So I don't want to give up either one. 39 is the car tuner.
