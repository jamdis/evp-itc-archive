 Another board to test some ideas, like designing the board to fit a store=
 bought cabinet, instead of making the board, and trying to come up with a =
box that it will fit in. Then while setting up the RF amp coil, I kept tryi=
ng to find the signal peak, and kept taking off turns. I could tell I was g=
etting close, but the number of turns is almost half what I thought it shou=
ld be, and what I had used in other radios. I must have been doing somethin=
g wrong before, because I finally reached signal peak, or where the coil an=
d the tuning diode resonate, at 66 turns of wire. I was using 110 turns on =
the coils, so the radios were not as sensitive as they could be. This one i=
s just kick butt! and small, that's a 9 volt battery for size comparison. O=
f course this is the radio/audio only board, sweep will be on a secondary b=
oard. I also wanted to check the radio operation, as I want to turn this on=
e into a printed circuit board.
 
 BTW, I don't calculate the turns on the =
coils, they're from the junk box, so there's no way to tell the ferrite mix=
, so you can't calculate the number of turns for a certain inductance.
