These spirit&#39;s ca=\r\nn  \nsometimes change the words around to suit them you know, he talks mostl=\r\ny \nvia a  program he originally got from the Cross over talk system, we don=\r\n&#39;t use \nthat  much any more because he can fix what we have copied, and reu=\r\nse the \nfiles if he  wants to.  He is becoming more understandable, maybe I=\r\n shouldn&#39;t \nsay this  because he is very busy over there, it&#39;s like non sto=\r\np people \ncoming in from  lower plains, (hundreds of thousands), that&#39;s one=\r\n reason they \nare not as  noisy as they used to be, because, before we all =\r\ncame along, they \nwere running  away from the light of God, and he, JC had =\r\nto seek them out, \nbut now they  are seeking Him out, and are getting into =\r\nthat line over \nthere.  I know, it  all sounds weird to me too, but that&#39;s =\r\nwhat they say, at \nleast there are no  &quot;hell fires&quot; over there, only darkne=\r\nss, it&#39;s like the inside \nof a warehouse with  levels, cement like ramps go=\r\ning through there, once \nthey get in the light,  everything changes, it&#39;s l=\r\nike going home.  And yes, we \ndo all keep our  identity.  David wanted me t=\r\no write this, and believe it \nor not they are  his words, and not my own:\n =\r\n\nIn fact no one would be happy in Heaven knowing  there are people &quot;burning=\r\n \nin hell&quot; and if they were happy knowing this it would  be sinful right \nt=\r\nhere, think about it, to burn sinners is not God&#39;s way, God  does not sin. =\r\nGod \nis love, He loved us enough to die for His people. He  does not put si=\r\nnners \ninto &quot;hell fires&quot; to be in a place of darkness without the  light of=\r\n God is \nwhat the lower plains are all about.\n \n&quot;If I be lifted up I will d=\r\nraw All mankind unto  me&quot; Jesus does not give \nup, He does not put people i=\r\nnto fires, there is NO fire  in the lower plains, \nonly darkness, it&#39;s pitc=\r\nh black, God is not cruel, if? God  did not love His \ncreatures, He would s=\r\nimply turn His head and we would all be  gone. Fire is \nexpression of the H=\r\noly Spirit who is kind, God does not &quot;burn&quot;  creation in \nhell fires, they =\r\nare people that do not believe, but God still  brings them \ninto the fold o=\r\nne at a time, they must repent.\n \nHeaven is not on one planet, &quot;Heaven? is =\r\n everywhere, we just can&#39;t see it \nwith our physical eyes.&quot; What you call &quot;=\r\nhell&quot;  is only a place of darkness, \nand Jesus continues to draw those in d=\r\narkness into  the Light even now, \nthere is no fire in &quot;hell&quot;  only darknes=\r\ns. The &quot;lake of  fire&quot; you refer to were \nthe fires in Gehenna, it was plac=\r\ne where they burned  garbage in Old \nJerusalem.
