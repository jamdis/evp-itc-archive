It would help if I really understood how the voices are formed, how\nthe sound is actually manipulated. The sound quality of the tuner is vital,\nothere things I&#39;ve tried, like echo chambers and adding in tones seem to be\nof little help. I&#39;m not an engineer, all I know is do the sweep thing and\n&quot;they&quot; talk. I don&#39;t know how to dail up an enitity, and I&#39;m not wise enough\nto ask questions.\n\n There&#39;s some out there that seem to think the box is imperfect and they\nwait fo rthr next stage. All that is a symptom of our siociety, expectingthe\nnext programmed advance. I think some are not being told how great they are,\nso the box must not be working correctly. Not so much here on these groups,\njust people I&#39;ve run into in the past.\n\n As above, so below! I&#39;m easily dismissed on this level, and I&#39;m not sure\nthis isn&#39;t true on high as well.\n\n F-S\n\nThe ne e ending ques o a pe ec une , while a nish d ies on o he boxes.
