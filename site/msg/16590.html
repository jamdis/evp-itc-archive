<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m an electrical engineer and also a radio amateur so I make a lot of pc
boards, both at work and at home.

Yes, that board should work. If you have a single-sided board pattern, after
you&#x27;ve developed the photoresist (or ironed on the toner, if you do it that
way) spray the other side of the board with spray paint and let dry. I like
to use the clear coat paint but it doesn&#x27;t really matter.

After you&#x27;ve etched one side, clean the paint and the photoresist off (clean
both sides) with acetone, MEK, etc. Do this in a well-ventilated area! Then
drill your holes.

If you are going to make a double-sided board, drill a few of the holes that
have common pads on both sides to orient the pattern on the other side and
repeat whatever method you use to put a resist on that side. After it&#x27;s
developed/ironed on, spray the already etched side with paint and etch the
other side. Clean off the board and drill holes.
