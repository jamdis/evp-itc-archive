<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wow, that more lines up with what has been said all along by preachers.  I hope David is wrong, but time will tell.  I do think this has much more of a chance of being true than Sarah Palin.  Lol

&gt; Well, it&#x27;s sure not her, it&#x27;s some fella now in Rome, according to David the Tech, he is now 29 years old, and he will start up his thing right after Obama makes a big mess for the US, gets more kids killed in senseless wars, I know, he didn&#x27;t start things, but he isn&#x27;t getting those kids out either, he is sending more to those country&#x27;s over there, such a waste.  And will even start up a 3 month mandatory civilian army for young people ages 18 to 19 maybe, younger.  Jerusalem will be left neutral, as will be the country of Israel, because the antichrist wants to seat himself there in the near future.  The antichrist is some guy that was born without a spirit, he has a soul, but wasn&#x27;t given a spirit until recently, that was the spirit of the antichrist that took over his physical body, so in a sense it is a spirit possession.  I really hope this is all wrong, I want to have things be like Pollyanna, but it won&#x27;t be that way for some time yet. sf

&gt;                                              I saw a clip on youtube where a ghost box group was asking who the antichrist was.  Of course their first question was if it was Obama.  the answer was no.  So then they asked who it was, and the box said it was Sarah Palin!  Lol, now I know... the spirits are all people from the left!
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;  PS- I love Sarah!  At this point, I would vote for her in a second!

&gt;  &gt;  Well, ya know Beth, he has broke many promises, as they all do once they get into office, look at how he has &quot;brought them all home&quot;Â  lol, he is sending more and more into other country&#x27;s, maybe, he is like a puppet for higher ups, it&#x27;s a scary situation, David has mention the antichrist on more then one occasion, he has moved from Spain to Rome lately, and will start up soon, making people really like him at first, then after someone here, could be a president, not going to say who, starts a war between several big country&#x27;s.Â  The US will be so weak from all the wasted life of those young people going into middle east and places, (they should be getting married, buying homes, and making baby&#x27;s right now, not dying).Â  It&#x27;s a situation 
&gt;  &gt; similar to Viet Nam, we lost a whole generation just right there, and what did we win?Â  
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Only about oil control, thing is the US may not follow the antichrist cause, but we are going to be so darn weak, that we will be fighting each other just to survive from what he says, he mentioned several country&#x27;s that will not follow antichrist, which are: US, Australia, Canada, UK, Russia, or China, thing is we may be enticed into fighting these other country&#x27;s which will only serve to weaken US more.Â  The antichrist won&#x27;t get Canada because they will bring him trouble, for some reason, maybe, when he thinks he&#x27;ll get those stubborn limies.Â  Believe me, I hope nothing like this happens, but we are moving toward much of it right now, and it&#x27;s scary. sf

&gt;  &gt;           Â                                   Well, I for one, hope David is right about Obama leaving office.  Of course, that would mean Joe Biden would be president... sigh.  That isn&#x27;t a happy thought either.
&gt;  &gt;  
&gt;  &gt;  I hope there is not another war.  I just heard somewhere of secret plans to attack Iran.  Lol, if I heard about it, it must not be very secret.

&gt;  &gt;  &gt; As the Tech, David might say; &quot;oh well,&quot;Ã‚Â  sometimes his expression is; &quot;for the last time&quot; or &quot;i really don&#x27;t wanna talk about it.&quot; sf
