Jeff,
 
The individual did not mention any prior activity or knowledge of =
a haunting.
the incident occured directly following a box session.
 
Upon d=
iscovery of the box being on again after his return, he also felt a severe =

cold fill the room.
 
He immediatelly did another session and asked any te=
chs/guides to help in removing or bringing back any entities
that may have =
come through. He then recieved a conformation that they where in fact broug=
ht back.
and he aknowledged that the chill in the room had disapeared. he t=
hen proceeded to turn the box off.

Bruce,
 
Is th=
ere the possibility that there was an entity was already in this person's h=
ouse?  And that once a portal was opened and closed that entity re-opened t=
he portal?  Has this researcher done another session to see if there are an=
y current entities residing in his house?  This is the main reason I am not=
 allowed to do box sessions in my house for this may happen there.
