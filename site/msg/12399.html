Andy, thanks for the compliments, much appreciated. Mai=
n credit
should of course go to Frank though, he provided the main roadwork=
 and
inspiration. My main concern design wise for this was to have a
versio=
n that was compartmentalized ("plug and play" if you will) so
that componen=
ts can be easily substituted for experimenting. Plus
something lower powere=
d to make it more portable, hence the idea to
use a low power speaker power=
ed by the input device, and a
corresponding hearing assistance device as th=
e mic/amp to amp it up. 
Once the lid is on, this thing is *loud* but clear=
. In fact, I have
the amp set to min volume and its still a little to loud =
to listen to
with headphones sometimes unless you play around with equalizi=
ng the
volume settings on the 820 and the speaker.

I'm also going to be ex=
perimenting swapping out the 820 with an iPod
shuffle containing a lengthy =
pre-recorded sound file of audio. 30
second talk (maybe me reading the alph=
abet or something), chopped up
with EVP-Maker, and then spliced out to repe=
at for 30 minutes or so. 
I realize, as Frank stated previously, that they =
can effect sound
anywhere including in a control sound like this as its bei=
ng recorded
or mixed. But my concern is satisfying the "skeptics" out there=
 who,
as you put it when you first joined the group, feel that using the
ra=
dio input it "would be hard to distinguish from coincidence". A
controlled =
input that can be referred back to for comparison would
satisfy that qualif=
ication that keeps getting thrown up.
