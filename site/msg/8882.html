Well said Bruce.  I have to admit that I've listen to countless hours of case files evps and have gotten great evps over the years.  However, I don't think that I've still learned the art of ghost box or evpm listening even though I've been running both every night for a while.  I think  I still haven't gotten the knack of listening to these styles yet, but I won't give up.

                Ron,
 
There is no folder for you in the files section.
Maybe it got lost in the shuffle. Re post it so I can give a listen.
 
As far as the allophones project being underwhelming, my opinion is just the opposite.
I have gotten very clear concise answers to direct questions and have had my name mentioned
numerous times. Cut the speed to 87% and uncheck x cross, you don't need it.
only cue should be checked.
 
When you do a session do not try to listen to all the sounds at the same time
Relax and try to let your ear pick out just the relevant stuff, that's in real time.
 
When you are going over the recording keep only the words that are clear and apparent
and clip out the other random junk like the, err eeh aah eer sounds.
 
You will find that in the seconds preceding a question, once the crap is peeled away the answer or statement is there.
Plus Ron, you have had no signal where you are since you started and have never had a chance to let your ear and brain become
a custom to listening to this type of communication. Give it some time, work with it and most of all, approach it
with a positive attitude and a relaxed frame of mind. I'm sure that soon the communication will start to come stronger and
make more sense.

To Bruce, Stefan and others using EVPM. I have posted a file of my test with EVPM allaphones under ronriko files.  I forward this for two reasons:  the first as a request from Bruce to determine recurring words and second because I wanted to have experienced ears hear my recording for comments.   Regarding the test, this is just 30 secs or so of a 7 minute recording.  Recorded at 90% using EVPmaker with xcross.  I was able to hear "art and arthor" a number of times within the 7 minutes.  This is after requesting no names be spoken.  
 
Regarding my experiences with evpmaker and the allaphone file sent by Stefan, I must say my results have been underwhelming.  I hear nothing but evp gibberish.  I ask that anyone with an ear for this to give a listen and tell me if you hear anything intelligent.  I am in a terrible radio zone here in Mexico so I have high hopes on EVP maker and the file Stefan provided.  Also excited about the fact that so many others are getting excellent communications.  Thank you to anyone who takes the time to listen to and confirm my recordings.  I am beginning to feel like I am being blocked out like William had thought.  Maybe I am in a true dead zone, no pun intended, or "they" don't want me in the loop for some reason.  Ron L

To all that are experimenting with the EVPM allaphone file method.

I have done a few sessions with this method as I know a few other 
researchers have.
There have been a couple of researchers that have done sessions and 
gotten very similar responses such as the name "Arthur" and responses 
pertaining to "Air" also "I am here" or "here".

I have also gotten direct and intelligible answers to questions 
immediately following the question, and messages that could never be 
construed as random.

The test that I propose and the answer I seek is, The words that keep 
coming up to almost all researchers experimenting with this method IE 
the words I mentioned above.

I would like to find out whether these certain words are simply by 
products of everyone using the same file and come up as a result of 
the file playing in evpm, or are they true entity communication.

The only questionable content are these few words not all the methods 
communication. In my opinion the majority of the communication from 
this method is genuine.
The method has produced communication including my name to me as well 
as other researchers that have gotten my name, and some of the 
statements and responses show signs of a sense of humor that would 
surely be absent in random word grouping.

Who ever is involved with experimentation of this method, will you 
please on your next session ask that if there is a spirit named 
Arthur for him not to mention his name or the list of words that I 
have posted. I suggest that this request be made verbally before the 
session as well as after.

And in the most polite manner. They seem to respond better to 
formality.

please dedicate one session no shorter than 2 minutes to this 
experiment and post your results.

Your cooperation appreciated.

Bruce
