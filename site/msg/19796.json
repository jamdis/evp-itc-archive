I thought it was a frag, except for the\ncontent. The attenuator cable has a 10K resistor in series with each channel\nfrom the head phone jack, the 10ks tie together to add the left and right\nchannels together, that feeds an attenuator made of a 39K resistor, and a\n470 ohm resistor to ground to bring the headphone level down to a mic level\nfor the recorder. Without the attenuator, you either have to record from the\nspeaker, or get severe distortion from signal clipping by overloading the\nmic input of the recorder. That whooosing sound is this going over the heads\nof the average ghost hunter. I think if people want decent EVP recordings,\nthey should know something about the technical aspects of actually\nrecording. Learn what a line level is and how to use it, not the kind used\nby carpenters!\n\nF-S\n\nReco ded om he headphone jack o digi al eco de ia a enua o cable. \"Nice ghos box\" in AM Boos ed a 9 seconds, and a 30 seconds \" How a e ya--good, plen y o oxygen\"--wei d.
