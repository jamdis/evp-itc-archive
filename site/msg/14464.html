Yes-perfect example of audible scrying.

What's happening is that the rando=
m audio is just a background used for you to scry into. Infact, if this is =
what is happening, I bet if you could get the "Your mom is calling" message=
 out of your head and listen to that same track on another occasion, you ma=
y hear a completely different message.

This could also be why Frank has re=
ported that his messages change from what he first heard.

In essence, it i=
sn't the physical recording sounds giving you the message, it is your subco=
nscious mind.

  Okay I have another one f=
or you to think about.. I tape a session and review it later..  even a day =
later.  Upon review the message that comes over is about something that 'ju=
st happened' while I was reviewing or happened after taping?  Is it possibl=
e that spirit can manipulate the recording AFTER recording has stopped or e=
ven manipulate the audio while reviewing?



  An give you an example of th=
is I was recording one day and I reviewed the audio the next day.  While re=
viewing - about half way through - the message "Your mother is calling" was=
 found.  I saved it and moved on and within two seconds my mom called.  You=
 say it is a coincidence except that I hadn't spoken to my mother in over a=
 year.  During this same conversation with her - we sorta made amends and I=
 told her the story of the 'secret' I had found out about a family member h=
aving a child out of wedlock in the late 1920s.  Quick backstory.. I found =
out about this out-of-wedlock birth through my genealogy research and conta=
cted spirit through the box and I was promptly told to keep it secret and w=
hich I promised to do.



  Well in this conversation with my mom after not=
 speaking for a year I told her what I had found out.  When the telephone c=
onversation ended with my mom. I was amazed that the recording had told me =
she would call right be fore she did - even though the audio was recorded t=
he previous day.  I proceeded to go back to reviewing the audio and the ver=
y first thing I heard was:  THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SECRET - YOU LIED.

  Maybe they can manipulate 'real-time' literally????

  2 di=
fferent things happening-that's why. When you get EVP that everyone underst=
ands, it is outward, in the environment. Not a communication through subcon=
scious means.



  EVP that people swear they hear, but noone else can make=
 sense, may be a message to them via subconscious means. That isn't to say =
that ALL EVP's like this are true messages, I am sure alot are just matrixi=
ng.



  But then that is how the art of scrying starts-matrixing. Like the=
 Rorschach tests. The images you matrix with those gives the psychologist a=
n insight into your mind.



  By gazing into a dark, reflective surface, y=
ou start to see cloudy images. At first, you will just be matrixing faces i=
n the clouds and not getting much substance. Try it, you will see what I am=
 saying. With practice, you start to see clear, concise images.



  I thin=
k that is what happening with audio as well.



  We already know for a fac=
t pareidolia can occur in audio as well as visual stimulus.

    yes I understand its personal to that par=
