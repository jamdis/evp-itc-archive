<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No doubt, I am really amazed at the results I have received from only
doing this a little over a month or so. This type of research isn&#x27;t
for everyone, but it is very rewarding. Cannot wait to see what future
sessions hold.


thanks

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Short .469 session yesterday, I asked if they could tell me my name.
&gt; &gt; Response I got was &quot;your actual name?&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I replied yes, my actual name and received &quot;Andy....Mike&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My name is Andrew Michael, and the response was almost immediate. The
&gt; &gt; file I posted was compressed for space saving, but from my initial
&gt; &gt; question I shaved several seconds off between the &#x27;yes my actual name&#x27;
&gt; &gt; and the &#x27;andy...mike&#x27; . total clip time before compression was
about 10
&gt; &gt; seconds. Still pretty new at this, so hearing my first and middle name
&gt; &gt; repeated back to me takes some getting used to, but very exciting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Andy
