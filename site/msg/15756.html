&gt; &gt; I am getting pretty tired of a few whos sole purpose in this group is to
&gt; provoke Frank and other members into negativity. If it continues you and
&gt; your fake nicknames will be removed. Your attempts to promote your &quot;other
&gt; group&quot; will be viewed as spam and deleted as such. They may go unnoticed by
&gt; the group but they dont go unnoticed by me. Funny how its always just that
&gt; one person/group that you promote while every post you make is not about
&gt; your research or anyone elses but rather a play on words meant to provoke
&gt; someone. You should run a quick background check on your friend the owner of
&gt; that &quot;other group&quot; you may find you know less than you thought you did. You
&gt; know who you are. And so do I.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As for Frank, he knows I dont always agree with what he says. He knows I
&gt; definitely dont agree with the namecalling or public venting. Having said
&gt; that. Frank is the founder of this group. As such he will ALWAYS have a
&gt; voice here. Those who dont like that or dont agree are free to move on.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you are here to learn about EVP-ITC, Frank&#x27;s Box, or share your
&gt; research, by all means do so. If you are here for another purpose then dont
&gt; be surprised when you go to sign in and find you are no longer a member
&gt; here.

&gt; Hi Misty,
&gt;
&gt; I joined this group a long time ago...pretty much a silent observer. I
&gt; don&#x27;t even read all of the emails I get on updates. I thought when I saw the
&gt; whole name calling thing it was some sensitive person whining about a spirit
&gt; saying colorful things to them...then I read a few. ARE THEY SERIOUS. Please
&gt; know there are many people who agree with you and Frank and agree whole
&gt; heartedly you should delete the faint of heart...LOL. Can you imagine how
&gt; they would react to a simple BOO from a voice from beyond? LOL...what fools.
