And spent much of her life as  an atheist, I even hate \nthat word.  Hopefully, some other&#39;s can here these  files, I tried to separate \nthem best I could, but some of the sentences, go  together. I know, you all \nwant them not to have the words I hear, but they are  long, and would not \nmake sense if I take whole sentences a part.  The first  one where it says; \nAyn Rand and Frank, lower plain people are saying; &quot;they  aren&#39;t ready they \nwith us&quot; then someone says, &quot;save us&quot; then some one else, a  man who sounds \nspooky, says, &quot;an ambush&quot; then someone says, &quot;David&quot;  &quot;here.&quot;  \n \nIn the second one; what sounds like  Angels, say, &quot;let them pass,\nIn the third file, I put the whole thing, says,  &quot;let them pass, their good&quot;\nThe last file is a charm and i feel sorry for  anyone who can not hear that \none because it&#39;s as clear as a bell, they, a man  says, &quot;Hello,&quot; I say \nhello, then he says; &quot;where are we?&quot;  \n \nThe last one a lady, maybe an  angel, don&#39;t know of course, she says, &quot;head \nfirst&quot; I think she wants them  to bow as they walk into the light, it&#39;s \nvery bright and hurts eyes or so I am  told, they are told to lower the gaze, \nor close eyes, when they are inside,  it softens, and they are home.  Hope \nyou all can hear, as for you RJ,  I am still trying to get David to tell me, \nit&#39;s not his fault, but my  own, it is hard to understand him sometimes. So, \nfar I&#39;ve got from the  peanut gallery, that you have: &quot;a penny,&quot; &quot;a hair \nbroom or brush,&quot; &quot;whistle,&quot; a  little kid says, &quot;ice cream&quot; lol, &quot;bridge&quot; and a \n&quot;Kleenex&quot;  I have no  idea what the heck you would have a &quot;bridge&quot; on the \ntop for, unless  it&#39;s the game.  sf\n \n \n\r\n--part1_7f6ed.7a791efe.39725a77_alt_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUS-ASCII&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18928&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; id=3Drole_body =\r\n bottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Dr=\r\nole_document  color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT col=\r\nor=3D#8000ff&gt;Said a little prayer, and tried to draw Ayn \nRand and her husb=\r\nand, Frank Rand into the light, I think it went well, as you \nall might kno=\r\nw, she did not believe in God.&nbsp; And spent much of her life as \nan athe=\r\nist, I even hate that word.&nbsp; Hopefully, some other&#39;s can here these \nf=\r\niles, I tried to separate them best I could, but some of the sentences, go =\r\n\ntogether.
