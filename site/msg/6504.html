I just had a Select A Tenna delivered to me in Mexico by a friend.  Unfortunately this one functions by dialing in the channel you want so it isn't functioning in a way that can be used with a scanning EVP setup.  I think a non dialer is available with the same company and that is what I ordered but I need to go back in a check.  Another $60 down.  I hope to use it to get Coast to Coast from San Antonio so it isn't all lost.   
   
  Jeremy   I listened to your posts and you got some great captures there.  I am encouraged because Mike is sending me a RS 125 for me to pick up in San Diego next month.  Sounds a lot better than my 469.   Ron L

I am very seriously considering buying a Select-A-Tenna.
