<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Elabeth,

Have you found that using the diffuser helps to eliminate dust orbs?  I&#x27;ve 
been using the built-in flash on my D70S but think it&#x27;s about time to get 
one of the Nikon speedlights to go with it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey Guys,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Any of you still use a 35mm to take pictures with? I have 2 of them
&gt;&gt;&gt; and tried over the weekend to utilize them in an investigation. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; exposure time on these things is like 30 seconds. It&#x27;s such a pain in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the butt. If you do use the 35mm, what kind of settings do you use?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Any advice? I am totally new to night photography. Has everyone gone
&gt;&gt;&gt; to digital now or what?
&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt; I use a digital SLR (Cannon Digital Rebel xti) with a big flash
&gt; mounted on it either directed up at the ceiling or with a diffuser
&gt; attached to avoid dust orbs. Occasionally I also will set it for a
&gt; long exposure to capture some cool architecture or something, but I
&gt; won&#x27;t use any of those photos as evidence just because there are so
&gt; many normal things that can happen during a long exposure to make
&gt; something odd show up in the pic.
&gt; In most situations with the right lens (I love my Canon 50mm f1.8) you
&gt; can adjust the iso and f-stop to take a good picture in low light with
&gt; a fast shutter speed without needing the flash. If you don&#x27;t
&gt; understand how all the settings (f-stop, iso speed, shutter speed)
&gt; work together I&#x27;d suggest getting yourself a basic photography book or
&gt; taking a class at your local camera shop. You&#x27;d be amazed how many
&gt; &quot;ghost pictures&quot; will start just looking like camera operator error to
&gt; you after a while. haha
