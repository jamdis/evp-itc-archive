<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Gabreael,

The software is &#x27;INTEL Sound Morpher&#x27;.
Right after I said EVP in the video, I thought about exactly what you 
bring up.  But, I guess it&#x27;s still EVP in a sense.  It&#x27;s just a sub-
set of EVP I guess you could say.  So, &quot;Disembodied Voices 
Experiment&quot; would be another way of putting it, you&#x27;re right... I 
guess the EVP tag is fixed to the older method of recording on tape 
or digital media of voices heard through white noise or just in the 
air... or imprinted on tape or other media.

Yumm... Sunday dinner.. what time do we eat ?  :-)

&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; You didn&#x27;t state in the video what the software you were using for 
&gt; your EVP experiment. What was it? Also since you were using the the 
&gt; hacks wouldn&#x27;t it be more real time communication verses EVP? Maybe 
&gt; something along the lines of &quot;Disembodied Voices Experiment.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Just my rambling thoughts while cooking Sunday dinner :)

&gt; &gt; For those who care to see... I&#x27;ve posted a quick 4 minute video 
&gt; tour of 
&gt; &gt; the EVP and ITC systems I use, with a quick explanation of their 
&gt; setup.
&gt; &gt; The video is at:
