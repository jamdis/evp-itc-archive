<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No charge at all unless you own land or rent. You can purchase  
different avatars, clothing, accessories, etc...
for your avatar. Second Life currency is called &quot;Lindens&quot;. You can by  
quite a lot of lindens for a couple of bucks via Paypal.
You can also get many avatars and clothes, costumes, you name it, for  
free. There are a lot of &quot;freebie&quot; type places on SL.

For a long time, I got everything free and had a lot of fun playing  
with my avatar. You can get pretty creative. I once saw Jesus float by  
and angels were singing around him - it was a riot - and later saw a  
very strange looking Elvis. You can be anything in SL.

Many different spiritual &amp; metaphysical groups meet in SL. They have  
places to meditate, talk, you name it. It&#x27;s a lot of fun to explore.

For a recording group, I was envisioning meeting once or twice a month  
(or more) to discuss our research and perhaps even try to record as a  
group... combine energies. Might be fun &amp; interesting!

&gt; w.  I checked out the site quickly.  Looks like a monthly charge is  
&gt; involved or no?  I will get back to it again when I have more time.   
&gt; What do you envision with a recording group...I might be  
&gt; interested?  ron l
