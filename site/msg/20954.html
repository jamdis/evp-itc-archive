&gt; So, Another intellectually challenged hater has invaded Frank&#x27;s group to throw out insults about GBC? You are not unique, original or inventive with your skepdick attack! You are just another closed minded know-it-all with too much time on your hands, who needs to get a meaningful life. Like a pesky fly, we just ignore your buzzing around until you go away!!

&gt; Nah, I&#x27;m just waiting for 2012 so I can get a front row seat to Frank&#x27;s pity party and making good on his promise to run over ALL of his boxes with his car if the world doesn&#x27;t explode. 
&gt;  
&gt; And I&#x27;m the idiot?

&gt; You seem to think this group is about &quot;helping&quot; new GB users and (ahem) &quot;researchers.&quot;
