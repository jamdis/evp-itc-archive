I am sorry, \n&gt;   after talking to council I removed my statement from Ghostboxhacks.\n&gt;   I don&#39;t want to fuel wild speculation. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   I wish I could go in to greater detail, at this time I have been  \n&gt;   advised not to.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thank you, Everyone for your emails and concern.\n&gt; \n&gt;   -Sum\n&gt;"}
