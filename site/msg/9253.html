<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m planning on next week, their mini boards, 3 for $60. 
I&#x27;ve tried to make boards myself, but it&#x27;s just one word c-r-a-p-p-y!

&gt; Hi Frank,
&gt; 
&gt; I think you mentioned once before you were thinking about using 
PCBExpress 
&gt; to make boards.  I could probably make them a lot cheaper than they 
do. 
&gt; The only drawback I have is that if they are double-sided boards, I 
can&#x27;t 
&gt; do plated-through holes and have to use &quot;C&quot; wires for thru-board 
&gt; connections.

&gt; &gt; I hate to ask for anything. I can afford what I need for myself. 
What I want to do is make some printed circuit boards that have the 
sweep, and amplifiers, then I would only have to add whatever tuner I 
want to use to form a system, and I could make the boards available. 
I wouldn&#x27;t mind putting this stuff together for others, but the 
requests/demands are so overwhelming, there just isn&#x27;t enough time.
