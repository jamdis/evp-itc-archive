Probably made in the early 20&#39;s judging by the condition and parts used. The front controls are tuning and headphone volume.\nA crystal detector is meant to plug into that socket, and the set wont work without it. A (modern) germanium diode could be used instead and soldered across the socket terminals.\nThe wire on the coil looks like its loosing its insulation so the coil is probably faulty and would have to be re-wound. \nJEFF\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Kris Bronson &lt;the_rocker_chick1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll be the first to admit I&#39;m no expert when it comes to ITC. The majority of \n&gt; my experience comes from working with Chris (Moon) and his box for the past 3 \n&gt; years. The results still never cease to amaze me! \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyhow, I came across this device at an estate auction. It appears to be an \n&gt; antique communication device of some sort. The only verifiable information I \n&gt; have is that is was probably built around 1910-1912, which is before radio was \n&gt; publicly available. \n&gt; (I obtained this date from researching the packaging cylinder used to build the \n&gt; device.) \n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have any thoughts on what it might be? I did show this device to \n&gt; Chris a while back and he agreed that it probably was a communication device. He \n&gt; also suggested I show it to Frank... = )\n&gt; According to Chris&#39;s box, &quot;this IS a communication device of historical value.&quot; \n&gt; It also mentioned the device was &quot;meant specifically for me to have, but no \n&gt; longer worked.&quot; There was more, but I&#39;m trying to remain unbiased and only \n&gt; use tangible evidence. However, I have little to go on.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone has any clues or can lead me in a research direction I would \n&gt; appreciate it! Thanks!\n&gt;"}
