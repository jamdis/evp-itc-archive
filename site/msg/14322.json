I does have a cadence similar to someone speaking, but it could just as=\r\n easily be something present in the environment-a natural background noise.=\r\n There is no way for me to tell for certain as it is just too feint. I can&#39;=\r\nt make out any clear words. Sure-I could probably matrix some in, but that =\r\nis all it would be.\n\nFor an EVP to be considered proof positive of spirit c=\r\nommunication by the community at large, it has to be clear enough that many=\r\n people hear the same thing, without hints or coaxing. If you have to have =\r\nhigh quality devices to make it out, it just isn&#39;t good enough. That does n=\r\not mean it isn&#39;t a true EVP, just that it isn&#39;t good enough to stand as evi=\r\ndence.\n\nAs for the whistle, it sounded like feedback to me as well, but I w=\r\nill have to take you word for it that you were no where near any other elec=\r\ntronics or EMF&#39;s that could contribute to feedback. Even so, if I am trying=\r\n to remain unbiased and objective, there is no way for me to say this is a =\r\nspirit, without personally being with you when you caught it. The only thin=\r\ng I can still say about it is could be, but for me it is non conclusive.\n\nI=\r\nf someone does not hear what you are hearing, try to remain objective and j=\r\nust understand that it isn&#39;t personal. You have to understand that with jus=\r\nt these recordings alone, there is no way to scientifically prove what you =\r\nhave recorded is spirit communication. If you could get consistent, intelli=\r\ngent question and answer recordings, then you would be alot closer.\n\nHere a=\r\ngain, we are back to the &quot;So what?&quot; thing. You don&#39;t HAVE to prove anything=\r\n scientifically, unless you want others to completely believe in your evide=\r\nnce.\n\nThe theory that is being kicked around is that some EVP&#39;s are persona=\r\nl, and only meant for the person recording them to hear. If this is the cas=\r\ne, no matter how clear something is to you, others may not hear it.\n\nApril\n=\r\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: James W.

In my short time I have gathered enough &quot;proof&quot; for myself th=\r\nat this method works for ME. And from what I have seen from others that I h=\r\nave let &quot;listen&quot; to my files (friends) I am blessed with the &quot;ability&quot; to H=\r\nEAR very low audio artifacts....so this will help me in my RESEARCH. And I =\r\nam OPEN to any help to reach my goals (or help others) with their goals. Ha=\r\nve fun people. On a HAPPIER NOTE :) I was lucky enough to catch the RR-DR60=\r\n taking a nap yesterday....it missed a few evp&#39;s real close together (in a =\r\n5 second clip) the Sony ICD-B7 heard a male use a different number than wha=\r\nt I used. I said 16 (my earlier age I was saying in recorder) and the male =\r\nevp said 13....then a female laughs. All this was missed by the DR60 (excep=\r\nt my 16 was recorded in both recorders) BUT then the DR60 &quot;caught&quot; the B7 &quot;=\r\nnapping&quot; at near the end of the 5 second clip....the DR60 heard &quot;let me out=\r\n&quot; in a clear (quite) males voice. So this is very promising piece of eviden=\r\nce for me. **those 2 recordings have been uploaded to my folder. I will inc=\r\nlude an Olympus W-10 (soon as arrives), Panasonic RR-US360 (when I think to=\r\n grab it) and my RR-QR80 to go with my RR-QR100, and one more (can&#39;t rememb=\r\ner what brand-model of this last---due to arrive) LOL. I need to build a mu=\r\nltiple mounting devise to aid in putting these into tandem service. Then I =\r\nthink I will use my Olympus DS-50 as my &quot;Control&quot; recorder....by using it o=\r\nn the HQ settings.

In my \n=\r\n  short time I have gathered enough &quot;proof&quot; for myself that this method wor=\r\nks \n  for ME. And from what I have seen from others that I have let &quot;listen=\r\n&quot; to my \n  files (friends) I am blessed with the &quot;ability&quot; to HEAR very low=\r\n audio \n  artifacts...&lt;WBR&gt;.so this will help me in my RESEARCH. And I am O=\r\nPEN to any \n  help to reach my goals (or help others) with their goals. Hav=\r\ne fun people. On \n  a HAPPIER NOTE :) I was lucky enough to catch the RR-DR=\r\n60 taking a nap \n  yesterday...&lt;WBR&gt;.it missed a few evp&#39;s real close toget=\r\nher (in a 5 second \n  clip) the Sony ICD-B7 heard a male use a different nu=\r\nmber than what I used. I \n  said 16 (my earlier age I was saying in recorde=\r\nr) and the male evp said \n  13....then a female laughs. All this was missed=\r\n by the DR60 (except my 16 was \n  recorded in both recorders) BUT then the =\r\nDR60 &quot;caught&quot; the B7 &quot;napping&quot; at \n  near the end of the 5 second clip....t=\r\nhe DR60 heard &quot;let me out&quot; in a clear \n  (quite) males voice. So this is ve=\r\nry promising piece of evidence for me. \n  **those 2 recordings have been up=\r\nloaded to my folder. I will include an \n  Olympus W-10 (soon as arrives), P=\r\nanasonic RR-US360 (when I think to grab it) \n  and my RR-QR80 to go with my=\r\n RR-QR100, and one more (can&#39;t remember what \n  brand-model of this last---=\r\ndue to arrive) LOL. I need to build a multiple \n  mounting devise to aid in=\r\n putting these into tandem service. Then I think I \n  will use my Olympus D=\r\nS-50 as my &quot;Control&quot; recorder....&lt;WBR&gt;by using it on the \n  HQ settings. I =\r\nam looking to build a &quot;subsonic&quot; microphone also (something to \n  do with t=\r\nhose low &quot;booms&quot; that I have noticed lead or follow many evp&#39;s). So I \n  lo=\r\nok forward to any ideas. Falure is NOT an option.
