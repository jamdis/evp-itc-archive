I also change the\n&gt; timing cap to 100uf, and use a 100K linear pot for frequency, in series with\n&gt; a 10k resistor instead of the 560 ohm.  The 10k resisitor is to try to\n&gt; prevent the motorboating sound when the sweep is too fast. Instead of\n&gt; providing the trianlge out, I used the last op amp for level setting, adding\n&gt; the DC offset, which goes to the + input, instead of the usual inverting\n&gt; input.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
