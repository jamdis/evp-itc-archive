&gt; I think the answers will vary from individual to individual based on thier
&gt; beliefs. As for me personally I grew up surrounded by unexplained events and
&gt; my parents tried to ignore the things that they couldnt see because if you
&gt; ignore it then it doesnt exist right? But there comes a time when the child
&gt; grows up and forms thier own ideas and beliefs. Personally speaking once I
&gt; reached adulthood there were many other people who experienced the same
&gt; things I did in that house so I began to see that there was more to it than
&gt; just a childs imagination.
&gt;
&gt; Most religions are based upon the idea that there is a higher power, that
&gt; we all have spirits, and that there is something beyond this life. To say
&gt; that someone is wrong for belief in ghosts I would have to say that billions
&gt; of others are wrong for having belief at all. I dont think bad of a parent
&gt; who takes their kids off to church every sunday nor do I think badly about a
&gt; parent who spends some time doing ITC. Telling a child that there is more
&gt; than what the eye can see, more than what the ears can hear, is giving them
&gt; the basics for growing up with a mind thats open to possibility. What they
&gt; do with that is up to them individually.
&gt;
&gt; I worry more about the kids who grow up with parents who are alchoholics,
&gt; drug addicts, liars, thieves, abusers, etcetera.. than anyone.
&gt;
&gt; As for if the effect is positive or negative, I think that has to do with
&gt; the intent or the approach taken by each individual whether it be ITC,
&gt; religion, or life in general.

&gt; &gt; I was wondering if anyone had an opinion on the impact of
&gt; &gt; performing
&gt; &gt; ITC experiments or sessions, when there are young children
&gt; &gt; around. Do
&gt; &gt; you think the children seeing their parents or others (in
&gt; &gt; person, not
&gt; &gt; on TV) engaging in this activity would have an effect on
&gt; &gt; the children,
&gt; &gt; and if so, do you think the effect would be positive, or
&gt; &gt; negative?
