Got antenna for my hack and no sound!", "author": "Kristin", "timestamp": "2008-03-31T22:57:16Z", "full_text": "First off - don&#39;t laugh.. some of us just were not born knowing how to\nwork with antennas and wires and freaking radios!  I have had poor\nreception and I want to make it better.  I purchased the Radio Shack \nAmplified AM/FM Antenna (#15-1859) and a headphone adapter  (i hope\nyou call it that.. it allows you to connect to headphones..) and 2 y\nadapters (1 w/2 male ends and 1 w/2 female ends)\n\nI hook the whole thing up (see my picture in the Photos under Kristin)\nand no sound!  Nothing Zip.. Zilch.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?  Do I need to open my hack up again and attach\nan antenna or do I have to many adapters.... \n\nPS  I also purchased 50ft of 16 gauge wire.. now what?\n\nLOL..  Anyone close to Austin who wants to help??!!\nk"}
