John S I just recently started a sister group where all we do is record wit=
h Jesus=C2=A0to get messages.
=C2=A0
Perhaps one of us, Bruce, Steve or Fra=
nk or I would even volunteer, should set up a sister group where all member=
s do is record with the dead to find out how they get their messags to show=
 up in the radio noise where our recorders pick it up.
=C2=A0
All recorded =
information can be used in our research to build a better device. Our group=
s today house all kinds of messages, but to set up a specialized group wher=
e the sole mission is to get info how they communicate to us, and how they =
advise we build a better device, this group and information received would =
be very beneficial to all of you that have the electronic skills to build a=
nd tweak.
=C2=A0
The key is only messages get posted that=C2=A0result from =
asking questions to the other side how they communicate with us using our r=
adios, recorders or even EVP-Maker.
=C2=A0
If no one wants to do this, I wi=
ll be happy to set that up with moderators. Please let me know.

=C2=A0 
That's all fascinating. It makes s=
ense to me.

I have gotten several EVP recordings in which a name was given=
. In all cases the name is not a name that was known by any of the living p=
eople present and there is no particular reason for anyone there to be thin=
king of that name. In one case the name was verified in old=C2=A0records=C2=
=A0as a person present in that location many years ago (but we certainly di=
dn't know that at the time we were there). In another case we're still=C2=
=A0trying to find out if anyone by that name was in that area within the la=
st 150 years.
