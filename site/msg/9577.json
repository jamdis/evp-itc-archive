Me and my fiance \n&gt; did a session, and this is how it went.       \n\n&gt; We usally do 10 min. of audio, and during the session we       first \n&gt; contacted a guy named Virgil, and we got him to say both of       our \n&gt; names. He said &quot;William&quot; for me, and &quot;Leigh&quot; for Ashley. We       all \n&gt; communicated for the 10 min. He didn&#39;t answer every question,       but \n&gt; he answered 75% of all answerslast night. We told him that we       \n&gt; wanted to prove that they exsisted on the other side. Life after       \n&gt; death. He answer &quot;we are over here&quot;, very plainly. After the 10       \n&gt; min. We ask for confirmation so we could shut off the radio, and       we \n&gt; got this answer &quot;that would be a bad idea&quot;. Which freaked       Ashley \n&gt; out. So we kept the radio on and we had a conversation       with this \n&gt; preacher, then while the band was still sweeping the       preacher came \n&gt; through and he talked to us (while sweeping the       band), and started \n&gt; to preach to us about our side, and how messed       up it is.(the band \n&gt; was sweeping the whole time, I never stop the       band from sweeping) \n&gt; He said that we needed to pray for our       enemies as well as our \n&gt; friends and families. He talked to us for       6 to eight minutes. \n&gt; Then we finished the session (Ask for       confirmation) when he didn&#39;t \n&gt; come through any more. We shut       down. Then of course I get up and \n&gt; put everything back the way it       is supposed to be. Leaving the \n&gt; session that we just did on the       laptop. Then I went to take a \n&gt; shower, and I come back. The laptop       was turned off and I lost all \n&gt; of the session. Sometimes the       computer will log itself off, then \n&gt; when you get back it is       exactly the was it was when you left it. \n&gt; But this wasn&#39;t the       case, some reason the laptop shut itself off, \n&gt; and we lost all of       the evidence that we had. Didn&#39;t have nothing, \n&gt; and I couldn&#39;t       believe that we lost everything. So thats why I am \n&gt; sitting here       typing away about what happen last night. Instead of \n&gt; me posting       files about what happen last night. I wish so bad that \n&gt; y&#39;all       would have been able to hear the communication. It was a life \n&gt;       changing experience. It made me think a whole lot different about \n&gt;       box research. I still can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t save it before the \n&gt;       computer turned itself off. That is what happen to me last night, \n&gt;       and change box research for me for the rest of my life.\n\n&gt;       Thanks\n\n&gt; William Rees Clarke III\n\n\n\n\n    ____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ __\nDo     You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
