I see showdows shift before these events. Celebrity deaths cause the shadows to shift too.\n\nF-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Esparza90&quot; &lt;loveday_scorpio@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In the month of January I don&#39;t remember exactly which specific day but I was about to go to sleep and I saw a &quot;shadow man&quot; on my wall dark figure with contours of what looked to be like a man. Disappeared as soon as I turned around to try to debunk it. I didn&#39;t have anything to document my experience with but I now have a camcorder which should yield some interesting results. I have yet to make a ghost box which shouldn&#39;t be too difficult. Last I used what just your typical EVP equipment using white noise, microphone and a computer to record. Though I plan to update the equipment I use to catch EVPs. The radio I used was from an amplifier and it took too much space in my room. So with new equipment I hope that its less of a space user. Something portable would be nice. I&#39;ve been reading all the posts as of lately interesting topics though. I have been watching Ghost Adventures and I really liked the experimental equipment they were using. Like this ghost box was very simple and portable. This huge triangular like object I suppose it was the speakers and a small digital recorder. It worked very well.\n&gt;"}
