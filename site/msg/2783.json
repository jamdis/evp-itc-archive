When someone tells me they have the knowledge to know what questions t=\r\no ask to verify the personality, I have to conclude they are absolutely clu=\r\neless.

When something knows how you think, what you are perceiv=\r\ning, and how it&#39;s being perceived, you can&#39;t prevent yourself from being de=\r\nceived, or more like played with. I know I&#39;ll be deceived, and tricked, and=\r\n I tell them have fun with that, cuz I don&#39;t really care. I&#39;m not after any=\r\n particular spirit, or piece of knowledge.    When these voices tell someon=\r\ne not to share the information, that&#39;s even thinner ice to on!  I still, ev=\r\neryday, question the value of this work, and if it warrents continuing. I c=\r\nan do this on my own, but I don&#39;t want to drag the unitiated into hell with=\r\n me! I find the communication mode itself facsinating, and don&#39;t expect tha=\r\nt profound paranormal knowledge others seem to seek. I don&#39;t care who is ta=\r\nlking through the box.  I think those seeking those bits of profound knowle=\r\ndge, or secrets will get lead right down the rabbit hole.
