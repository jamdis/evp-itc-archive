Jeremy:
                 You may also want to try and ask the questions quickly (I often times write them down prior to a session).  The reason being I have noticed that many people drag the questions or ask more than one question prior to getting a response.  Please note that in my research I have on occasion spoken over them and get not the immediate response because I was too busy talking.  I have even gotten from my tec David to ("I'm  Talking) which was funny cause anyone that knows me, knows I love to gab, lol.  I have attached to clips so you can see what I am talking about.  The first one David tells me that basicly I needed to listen and not speak, for he was not done.  The second, Joel is asking a questions and the question seems to go on and on, only to have David say "Joel Speak Up".
   
                    In addition, I have also gotten as many as 3 spirits responding to your question at the same time.  I believe Bruce and Steve have experienced that on more than one occasion.  Maybe they could post or attach one of these files for an example.  
   
                    They know whats going on, and they will comply with you and guide you along the way.  Best of Luck and Great Job!

I have a totally different thought pattern. 

I do understand what you are saying though about doing it one question
at a time. I'll be sure to do that from now on. Thanks for the help.
