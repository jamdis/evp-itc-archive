I was holding a probe on the \naudio output of the radio chip, which went to a boombox. I was recording \ndirectly from the speaker while manually tuning across the FM band. I&#39;m \nstill missing one part for the AM.\n\nBTW, Alexander MacCrea, in Scotland I think, uses almost the exact same \nsound chamber as I do, and we&#39;ve never discussed it. He calls his the Lynx.\n\nFrank-S\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nKick back and relax with hot games and cool activities at the Messenger \nCafï¿½. http://www.cafemessenger.com?ocid=TXT_TAGHM_SeptHMtagline1\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_4d4d_fa1_de\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;Randy-YourBloodIsCirculating---.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;Randy-YourBloodIsCirculating---.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_4d4d_fa1_de\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;25SecondAudioTest-A.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;25SecondAudioTest-A.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_4d4d_fa1_de--"}
