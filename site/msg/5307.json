So, if we have 14 min of dead time \nbefore &quot;clyde&quot; appears and you edit the 14 mins, is there any other \nradio band &quot;noise&quot; that appears or is it simply quiet?  Also, can you \nbe so sure that deleting these 14 mins that there aren&#39;t other \nmessages on other frequencies to retrieve?\n\nGreatly appreciate your opinion on this matter,\n\n- Rak\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I edit my files to display the answer, i.e---if i ask what is your \nname \n&gt; and 14 seconds later they say &quot;clyde&quot;.  At that point i will cut \nout \n&gt; the 14 seconds of nothing and just leave the answer to my \nquestion.  \n&gt; Sometimes i have to make the file a bit louder, but no mods to the \n&gt; actual file.  It is what it is and i leave it in raw format for all \nto \n&gt; hear, the less you mess with the files is better to bring people \nonto \n&gt; this side of the fence.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rebecca&quot; &lt;rak4dds@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello All -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have been studying this format of communication for better part \nof \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; year now.  I have been listening to clips and reading posts here \nfor \n&gt; &gt; sometime and am impressed with direction of your work.  The \nmajority \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; clips I&#39;ve listened to, regardless of the type of box used, are \nquite \n&gt; &gt; clear.  My question to you is as follows:  are the files edited \nor \n&gt; &gt; changed at all or is this the quality they are coming through \nat?  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Rak\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
