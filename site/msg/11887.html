<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve heard of this as well, but my question was, do we have any EVP  
evidence that the *Fish Group* ever claimed to be other than dead  
people?

&gt; Wisteria,
&gt;
&gt; I forgot but you may be quite right! There are spirits who have  
&gt; never been incarnated into human form. They tend not to be involved  
&gt; in any way with lower forms of vibration.
&gt;
&gt; Edgar Cayce spoke of them. Their souls were created as the moment  
&gt; of Creation. They chose not to have ever incarnated. Since their  
&gt; vibration level is far more than a lowly entity, I highly doubt  
&gt; that they would interact with lower entities. They are on a  
&gt; completely different level of existence.

&gt; I just said that in reference to Al&#x27;s comments. There are a cluster  
&gt; of researchers who insist on tagging religious myth on research...  
&gt; angels, devils, heaven, hell, assuming anything visiting our plane  
&gt; is &quot;stuck&quot; and needs &quot;saving&quot; and ignoring other energies assuming  
&gt; everything they hear is or was a human mortal.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yes, I&#x27;ve heard from many energies claiming to be many things and  
&gt; some never having inhabited a body.

&gt;&gt; I said that because all of the examples I heard of EVP by the Fish  
&gt;&gt; Group has sounded very human and they have never claimed to have  
&gt;&gt; been other than human that I have heard. I have to base my  
&gt;&gt; conclusions on the EVP files, not speculation, even from the  
&gt;&gt; victims. Do you know of instances where they audibly claimed to be  
&gt;&gt; nonhuman? I may have missed them--I heard a lot of EVPs from them,  
&gt;&gt; but certainly not the sum total. (As I said--I even got one myself  
&gt;&gt; the other day.)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I think you&#x27;re right that they are definitely mobile, and a  
&gt;&gt; collective.
