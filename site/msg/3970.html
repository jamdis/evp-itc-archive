&gt; Hi Kristin,

&gt; I&#x27;m not an electronic engineer either. I&#x27;m more of a tech as far as
&gt; ideas and an experimenter with functional tools. However, Ron
&gt; Ricketts is an engineering wizard and a friend. He lives in the
&gt; Dallas area. Would you like for me to give him a contact email for
&gt; you?

&gt;&gt; Hi Lance.  I have family in the Dallas area and get there often.
&gt; The kind
&gt;&gt; of help I am referring to is stuff like which tiny little spec on a
&gt; board
&gt;&gt; goes to what wire?  Or how not to solder my fingers, etc.
