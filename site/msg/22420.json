The creature=\r\n is often described as a flying biped with hooves, but there are many varia=\r\ntions. The Jersey Devil has worked its way into the pop culture of the area=\r\n, even lending its name to New Jersey&#39;s team in the National Hockey League.=\r\n\n\n\nLegends and reported encounters:\n\n\nMost accounts of the Jersey Devil leg=\r\nend attribute the creature to a &quot;Mother Leeds&quot;, a supposed whore although t=\r\nhe tale has many variations. According to one version, she invoked the devi=\r\nl by saying &quot;let it be the devil&quot; while giving birth to her 13th child, and=\r\n when the baby was born, it either immediately or soon afterward transforme=\r\nd into a devil like creature and flew off into the surrounding pines. The c=\r\nhild was born with horns, a tail, wings, and a horse-like head. The creatur=\r\ne revisited Mrs. Leeds every day. She stood at her door and told it to leav=\r\ne. After awhile, the creature got the hint and never returned. \nAccording t=\r\no legend, while visiting the Hanover Mill Works to inspect his cannonballs =\r\nbeing forged, Commodore Stephen Decatur sighted a flying creature flapping =\r\nits wings and fired a cannonball directly upon it to no effect. Joseph Bona=\r\nparte, eldest brother of Emperor Napoleon, is also said to have witnessed t=\r\nhe Jersey Devil while hunting on his Bordentown, New Jersey estate around 1=\r\n820. Throughout the 19th century, the Jersey Devil was blamed for livestock=\r\n killings, strange tracks, and reported sounds. In the early 20th century, =\r\na number of people in New Jersey and neighboring states claimed to witness =\r\nthe Jersey Devil or see its tracks. Claims of a corpse matching the Jersey =\r\nDevil&#39;s description arose in 1957. In 1960, the merchants around Camden off=\r\nered a $10,000 reward for the capture of the Jersey Devil, even offering to=\r\n build a private zoo to house the creature if captured.\nThere are many othe=\r\nr versions of the legend. The legends say it was the 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, =\r\nor 13th child, It was born normal or deformed, and the mother confined it t=\r\no the cellar or the attic. Although there are many discrepancies in all of =\r\nthese stories, there are 3 pieces of evidence that tie all of the legends o=\r\nf the Jersey Devil&#39;s origin together. From the pre 1909 era, few documented=\r\n records of sightings still exist. The ones that do, confirm the existence =\r\nof the devil.\n\n\nChris Chaos\nAxis Video/Pine Barren Films\nPO BOX 551\nGlouces=\r\nter, NJ 08030\n\n\nAxisvideo@...\n\n\r\n----------MB_8D0AD1E4365F8C4_61C_9B8C6_Webmail-d111.sysops.aol.com\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;\r\n\r\n&lt;font color=3D&#39;black&#39; size=3D&#39;2&#39; face=3D&#39;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&#39;&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;br=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;font-fam=\r\nily: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: Helvetica, =\r\nArial, sans-serif; clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;a=\r\nrial&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;The Search for the Jersey Devil&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/TheSearchForTheJ=\r\nerseyDevil&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;cl=\r\near: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DCxjJMZF_eqw&quot;&gt;https=\r\n://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DCxjJMZF_eqw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear: bo=\r\nth;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;cl=\r\near: both;&quot;&gt;http://www.juntoboxfilms.com/projects/the-search-for-the-jersey=\r\n-devil&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:=\r\n both;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;LOG LINE:&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;The New Jersey Pine Barrens is the perfect place to hide=\r\n something, and to keep something hidden.
