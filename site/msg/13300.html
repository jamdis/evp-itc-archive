Something I forgot to clarify in my last email.... ITC is not a belief syst=
em, belief is not a requisite for this research. The question of mental com=
petency can only be answered after evaluation by a qualified psychologist. =
If a person is neglectful or abusive then a child could be removed. Social =
workers usually work under the license of a state certified psychiatrist (w=
ho is an MD) and has=A0to give the final=A0diagnosis of=A0the subject. The =
social worker can provide therapy, recommendations and such but cannot cert=
ify a person incompetent.

Its not as easy as it looks to take a child away=
 from thier mother and father. Technically, everything is supposed to be fa=
ir when it comes to this subject but in a lot of cases it is not. That depe=
nds on how well connected the social services person is and how good of a l=
awyer you have. Ultimately, even the psychiatrist has to present evidence a=
nd recommendations to a judge who makes it official.

To answer the questio=
n whether a child would be removed from parents who research ITC; highly un=
likely!

Regards,

Frank R.

Your practice of ITC research does not mean =
you cannot care for your child. Social services do not take your children f=
or your beliefs, they take them because you are not able to care for them p=
roperly and/or are abusive. Look at any number of fanatical religious pract=

eing subjected to some pretty scary ideas. Belief is not a requisite for th=
is research, only the desire to communicate.

Mental health is defined as t=
he psychological state of someone who is functioning at a satisfactory leve=
l of emotional, cognitive=A0and behavioral adjustment. The condition of 'no=
rmal' would be defined as the average of social expectations, which can be =
completely different from one culture to the next. I'm not bragging by stat=

I think Misty makes some good po=

 belief system, such as a religion.=A0 I agree, too, that it will depend on=
 the individual situation, as some will do this in a healthy way, and some =
may not: for example, we could all probably name some religious cults that =
have been more harmful than good.=A0 In the ITC world, I suppose a bad situ=
ation would be one where a poor ITC researcher (one who thinks they are get=
ting results, but isn't) insists to the child that they can hear spirits. A=
nd I suppose a good situation would be as Misty suggested: where an open mi=
nd is presented to them.=A0 

And as Frank noted, this likely also depends =
on the child. And Frank also mentioned something I thought was interesting:=
 mental health.=A0 What is normal for mental health is often defined as wha=
t the majority believes.=A0 Since ITC is still not as big a belief system a=
s other religions or belief systems, it could be seen as abnormal by the un=
initiated.=A0 And if Social Services were to get involved (depending on how=
 open minded the worker was) it could result in a messy situation for someo=
ne who was insisting they could hear voices talking to them over the radio =
or other devices.=A0 

Or do you think this is an overreation on my part to=
 what Frank meant there?

I think the answers will vary from individu=

 there comes a time when the child grows up and forms thier own ideas and b=
eliefs. Personally speaking once I reached adulthood there were many other =
people who experienced the same things I did in that house so I began to se=
e that there was more to it than just a childs imagination.

Most religions=
 are based upon the idea that there is a higher power, that we all have spi=
rits, and that there is something beyond this life. To say that someone is =
wrong for belief in ghosts I would have to say that billions of others are =
wrong for having belief at all. I dont think bad of a parent who takes thei=
r kids off to church every sunday nor do I think badly about a parent who s=
pends some time doing ITC. Telling a child that there is more than what the=
 eye can see, more than what the ears can hear, is giving them the basics f=
or growing up with a mind thats open to possibility. What they do with that=
 is up to them individually.

I worry more about the kids who grow up with =
parents who are alchoholics, drug addicts, liars, thieves, abusers, etceter=
a.. than anyone. 

As for if the effect is positive or negative, I think th=
at has to do with the intent or the approach taken by each individual wheth=
er it be ITC, religion, or life in general.
