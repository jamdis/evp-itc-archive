<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>LOL Al as for me I probably just didnt know the answer hehehe and for a few weeks there maybe even missed the questions. Workin stinks sometimes! Its such a tiresome distraction. But you are absolutely right sometimes I would rather spend my free time on my research than sharing/posting on any of the message groups I am in.

&gt; Stephen,
&gt; The question you are aksing is logical and needs to be
&gt; asked and answered. In the past I have asked some pointed
&gt; questions and to this date, none of them have been answered.
&gt; 
&gt; Stay and ask your questions... just don&#x27;t expect much
&gt; of a real reply from &quot;researchers&quot; !

&gt; I can leave the group not a big deal

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m still wondering how this list went from a
&gt; group of highly 
&gt; &gt; researchers all using Frank&#x27;s boxes, mini&#x27;s
&gt; etc., and getting amazing 
&gt; &gt; results, so people who don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s
&gt; real and have never used one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And it&#x27;s Frank&#x27;s original group on top of it
&gt; all.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sigh.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I believe I have recorded spirits, however I have

&gt; &gt;&gt; I will record anywhere, anytime and I have

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But, are there any files on this group where
&gt; any of you believe you
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are communicating with a spirit? Frank&#x27;s
&gt; box seems to really force
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all kinds of &quot;voices&quot; out of the
&gt; airwaves and I am not yet buying it.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Does any one have anything constructive to
&gt; say to us in regard to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; actual paranormal investigation via
&gt; Frank&#x27;s box, rather than mildly
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; entertaining techno-tweaking?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I was on a multi-group investigation at an
&gt; old historical mission in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Santa Barbara a week ago, for instance and
&gt; watched the frank&#x27;s box at
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; work for the first time.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sure, I heard a few things that sounded
&gt; obviously like radio, but we
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; did hear a very eerie woman&#x27;s voice
&gt; screaming when we were in the main
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; chapel room, and THAT got my attention.. But
&gt; everything else I have
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; heard so far in the files here is not
&gt; striking me as the voice of any
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; apparition, due to the weakness of quality.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If you&#x27;re still reading this, I have to
&gt; tell you I have had striking
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; results in my own home, simply letting a
&gt; recording device roll, and if
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you&#x27;re not yet interested in hearing
&gt; these samples, I guess you&#x27;re
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more into the box than the afterlife and
&gt; that&#x27;s YOU, not me! :)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; LOVE,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Katherine.
