<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I used to put in a &quot;range&quot; and &quot;center&quot; control on the older boxes for that 
purpoe, but no one ever used it, so I started leaving it out.

About that noise, I didn&#x27;t think, but the smoke detectors, floresent lights, 
and who knows what else, in large buildings puts out a horrendous amout of 
RF interference. I doubt if there is any way to filter that out without 
losing all reception.

I call it boring cuz that&#x27;s pretty much my life, I never get out.

&gt;Frank, It&#x27;s not boring I promise. For everyone here that follows your work 
&gt;it&#x27;s exciting to watch where this is going. Question, is there a manual 
&gt;over ride so the linear tune function be parked on a station? I know this 
&gt;isn&#x27;t the purpose but it could be a plus. -Bill

&gt;    This is the latest printed board I just now ordered. If anyone wants to 
&gt;see
&gt;  it you have to download the PCBExpress software at www.PCBexpress.com. 
&gt;The
&gt;  silk screen markings are for assembly purposes, and won&#x27;t be on this 
&gt;order,
&gt;  so I didn&#x27;t care if there was some over lap. There&#x27;s no way to mark the
&gt;  layout underside components, but I have my notes for that. All components
&gt;  are from mouser.com.
&gt;
&gt;  Even though the layout is labled &quot;RVG&quot;, it is in fact linear and random, 
&gt;AM
&gt;  and FM, with stereo input and output (except for the monitor speaker). 
&gt;There
&gt;  is provision for both wire, and bar antennas. The board was made extra
&gt;  copmpact to reduce cost, I wanted to keep the two boards under $100, the
&gt;  cost was about $93. With silk screen and solder mask, they would have 
&gt;been
&gt;  double.
&gt;
&gt;  After endless hours staring at the screen, my eys are about fried, I have 
&gt;a
&gt;  spot in the right eye, that hopefully will clear up.
