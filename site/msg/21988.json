It is a couple hundred yards from the state&#39;s largest supplier of\n&gt; crushed limestone for the last 100 years. The grass was mowed but that was\n&gt; the extent of the upkeep. Many tombstones were broken and tossed to the\n&gt; outside edge of the cemetery. Many children were buried there. The oldest\n&gt; tombstone we found was1815. It was 60 degrees the whole time were there. We\n&gt; were sooo cold and we could easily see our breath. I&#39;ve never heard of any\n&gt; paranormal experiences regarding here and we&#39;ve decided to keep\n&gt; it anonymous  in an attempt to preserve what is left. The photos are kind of\n&gt; &quot;iffy&quot; I might be seeing things where there isn&#39;t anything. I&#39;d appreciate\n&gt; any feedback.\n&gt; \n&gt; EVPs &lt;http://paranormalarcheologysurveyteam.weebly.com/evps.html&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Photos &lt;http://paranormalarcheologysurveyteam.weebly.com/photos.html&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Vicky\n&gt;\nWOw, some of the images are interesting. Faces in the woods, simple answer is matrixing. But it would be a good place to conduct continuing investigations. If you get more images and EVPs you have something to compare and develope more evidence.  Good Work."}
