Good question..

I was just demonstrating the manual sweep method to a co-worker, and they talk to him, but nothing really profound, other than the fact that they talk. Maybe I'm just trying to define what it is that talks. What level of spirit, or being is it? I don't think it's the classic paranormal idea of ghosts.
