<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I often use my Alinco DX-77 to tune in German or French, and 
sometimes Chinese, and use that as a raw audio using the foreign 
language method. You tune in a language you don&#x27;t understand, 
announce your&#x27;e doing an EVP session and record from a short distance 
form the speaker. Often on play back there will be meaningful 
mesasages in your language mixed in with the orignial broadcast. It&#x27;s 
contraversial, and people that speak the language used can&#x27;t hear the 
messages.  i also like to tune between station on an AM radio when 
skip is coming in, that results in some clear and meaningful voices.

&gt; Hey Frank,
&gt;  
&gt; I have a ham radio with a built in scan mode.  Would that work in 
some  way 
&gt; if I can vary the squelch enough so that maybe only close enough 
signals  could 
&gt; come thru to me?
