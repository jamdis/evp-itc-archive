<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Not my words, but those of Konstantin Raudive, after his passing...
through messages received by Maggy Harsch-Fishbach of Luxembourg
(another quote from Macy&#x27;s book...)


&quot;ITC is the most important means of waking the human consciousness out
of its sleep, and in that way will play an important role in getting
you through the coming &#x27;End Time&#x27; but in order for ITC to further
develop on Earth, it must involve an effort of many unified minds
representing many countries. It cannot be centered around any one
country, and especially not around any one individual.&quot;
