Esnips is very easy to use it has two uploa=\r\nding options in case you cant use the java application use the single file =\r\nuploader.

Posting from email as an attachment also works just not so =\r\nwell for the very large file sizes. There are many other file sharing stora=\r\nge places besides esnips.
