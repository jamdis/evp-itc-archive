<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Cranky&#x27;s not bad, but sometimes I can get mean. I have found that when in 
this mood, I get nothing though the box, until I reconnect with the cosmic, 
I guess you&#x27;d call it, so energy is important. If I continue that reasoning, 
if everyone&#x27;s energy is different, than maybe the box output, or any 
method,. will also be as diferent? Yeah, cranky, and slow!

Anyway, absolutely no more arguements.

&gt;It&#x27;s ok Frank we all know its a touchy subject for you right now. I think 
&gt;you are right they are all good researchers and they mean well. We all take 
&gt;different approaches to the work. We just have to remember we are all on 
&gt;the same team and not let our differences get in the way of our progress 
&gt;together.
&gt;
&gt;   I look forward to hearing results from everyone. All methods, boxes, 
&gt;water, music, evpmaker, radio, air, laser, light...bring it on. The more 
&gt;the merrier and perhaps we will connect with what others are posting.
&gt;
&gt;   Oh and Frank... if you werent cranky sometimes, then I would wonder what 
&gt;did they do with the real Frank Sumption =)~

&gt;I think I over reacted when I thought maybe Bill Murphy, or Rosemary Guiley
&gt;were using the boxes inappropriately. For that I apologize.
&gt;
&gt;What Rosemary was doing by &quot;imprinting&quot; the boxes was not in itself not
&gt;incorrect, and may actually help the communcations, after all she has
&gt;written several books, and is much more knowledgeable than I on things
&gt;paranormal. Bill seems to be an honest researcher, and he is a likeable guy
&gt;in person.
&gt;
&gt;I apologize to everyone for becoming maybe too sensitive to others ideas
&gt;about how the boxes should be used.
