Yes, the voice sounds distraught. In this very same session I can hear &#39;stations&#39; or control points testing, some giving locations. Yesterday I posted one that mentioned Amsterdam. In reviewing again today I can hear another message that mentions New Zealand.\n&quot;Your coming through, you&#39;ve got Southern New Zealand&quot;\n\nDave\n\n\n--- lisby@... wrote:\n\nFrom: Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] RS 12-469 Recordings using the Optical Microphone\nDate: Tue, 4 Dec 2007 18:56:09 -0500\n\nI&#39;m hearing &quot;I don&#39;t want to go,&quot; I think. I can&#39;t hear a D sound.  \nBut either way, the speaker sounds horribly distraught!\n\nAnn\n\n\nOn Dec 4, 2007, at 6:01 PM, RetroCom wrote:\n\n&gt; Thanks Frank R. I get messages about heterodyning from time to  \n&gt; time. The optical microphone system I use is ultra sensitive to low  \n&gt; frequency vibrations. Perhaps they can use the &#39;Schuman resonance&#39;  \n&gt; as a carrier.\n&gt; A couple more captures from this session. This first one is very  \n&gt; emotional.\n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t really wanna die&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Give him more secrets&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\r\n----__Part.20071204161822.8E6A82B7\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;120307yourcomingthroughyougotsouthernnewzealand.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;120307yourcomingthroughyougotsouthernnewzealand.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__Part.20071204161822.8E6A82B7--"}
