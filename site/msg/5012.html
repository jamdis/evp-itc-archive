Susie Boo won one last week, and I know she was suprised to have seen it on E-Bay.  She bid the last minute like I  and I think she got hers for under $200.00.

Juli got a deal at $255, I'm thinking. I'm guessing they now have 
their reserve set at around $350, at least. I think they tested the 
waters with that first one on ebay, seeing what the price would peak 
at, with no reserve on it. Let's see at happens next.
