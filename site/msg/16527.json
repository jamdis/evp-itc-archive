Two things appear to be going on though.  \n  First there is an actual voice modulated signal. Different people who listen to it often hear the same thing.  The sound is not perfect and is very noisy, so that would explain others who cannot hear the message.\n     The second thing is that some people can listen to the noise as a &quot;random field&quot;, and with a slightly altered state of mind, this field will induce latent &quot;mediumship&quot; ability in the operator and he or she will get a lot more information and voice material than another listener.\n\nNote that the content random fields have little or nothing in common with whatever imagery or sounds may be percieved from them.  They simply enhance the user to access psychic information that, while even not being a &quot;psychic&quot; allows him to get info normally innaccessable to him/her.\nIf there is any objective percieved sound similar to what is heard by others impressed upon the background noise, it might be due to the spirit who is speaking being PRESENT.  That entity would then be able to get the message through to the operator Psychicly on another level.  that the words are also in the noise would be a co-incidence.\n\nI work with VISUAL random fields---The imagery, while clear, is formed in my mind/eye system , so I cannot photograph it.  Some of this EVP background noise may be working the same way too---formed in the Mind/EAR system.  This is only heard by the primary operator and likely cannot be recorded to a file.  \n  But some random field stuff IS objective--for example, using a random backdrop for ghost photos makes the ghosts easier to, and more often appear in a photo.  This is equavalent to the EVP that people can hear on the recorded file.\n\nI will discuss and explain random field theory itself, later, in its own posting. \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Just a guess, since I don&#39;t have a lot of experience with this - probably\n&gt; the mesages are meant for one user and it&#39;s best if one user listens at a\n&gt; time.\n&gt; \n&gt; It could be that some messages come through that are meant for multiple\n&gt; users at once. I&#39;ve heard the same things as Frank in some of the recordings\n&gt; he&#39;s posted.

So how do you see not asking it questions squaring with\n&gt; &gt; Frank&#39;s comment of &quot;It&#39;s not the device, it&#39;s the user. The messages\n&gt; &gt; received are for the user, and rarely does anyone hear the same thing as the\n&gt; &gt; original listener.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does that mean two people can&#39;t use it together?  How would they know which\n&gt; &gt; the message was for if they do?  Or is it best to only use it alone?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On *Thu, 1/7/10, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] What does it do?\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, January 7, 2010, 10:40 AM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think any of us know really who or what the &quot;entities&quot; are.

The tuning is swept across the entire band, AM or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; FM, the resulting bits of speech, music, and noise are used by the enitites\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as a raw material to build their voices from. The sweep can be linear,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; random, or manual, and it does not have to cover the entire broadcast band.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This is one method and device for providing the raw audio, and if you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tesitng to see if it&#39;s just broadcast fragments, consider this-the concept\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is the same as EVPmaker, EVPmaker runs on a computer, the entities\n&gt; &gt;&gt; manipulate that raw audio *inside* the conmputer, and if you think stray\n&gt; &gt;&gt; RF is going to get *inside* the hard drive and mix with the audio file\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you have no clue how any technology works.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Testing is irrelavent!

No two people hear\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the same, so an &quot;objective listener&quot; is an insult to most people doing this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; work.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  I know, I&#39;m being harsh.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Thu, Jan 7, 2010 at 8:20 AM, rasterer &lt;rasterer@yahoo. com&lt;http://mc/compose?to=rasterer@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hey all, I&#39;ve seen lots of people posting their perspectives and results\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and such about the Frank&#39;s Box. In order to help develop some good testing\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for it, I think the first step is to get a common or official consensus or\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; statement on what it is the Frank&#39;s Box is claiming to be doing. This might\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; seem a silly question, but I think it&#39;s important to make sure any testing\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t go off in some irrevelevant direction.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Frank - or anyone - what is a good official statement on what the Frank&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; box can do?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
