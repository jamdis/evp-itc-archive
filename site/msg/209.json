I am using a pc tv/fm card without the fm antenna=\r\n hooked up. I watch tv on my pc sometimes and it has radio.

I asked them=\r\n if anyone could use this method and the results were varied. I guess it de=\r\npends on who the person is. For instance I had one voice say clearly &quot;it re=\r\nally works&quot;, then once I saved it and played it back it had changed to &quot;it =\r\ndidnt work&quot;. But heres one answer that didnt change so perhaps you can hear=\r\n this one. I&#39;ll also add the it really works one for you to see what you he=\r\nar on your end.
