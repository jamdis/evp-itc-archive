I am looking for 5 - 10 researchers to voluntarily participate in an
effor=
t that will become a part of the mini-documentary I am planning to
begin fi=
lming later this month.  When completed early in 2009 I will be
placing thi=
s video on my Youtube site for all to view. Freely sharing
our research is =
the key!  If you are one that participates, I'd like to
be able to mention =
you and display your work in the video.

The subject of the research is:
At=
tempted spirit contact using an object associated with a disaster as a
cata=
lysis for a specific contact... away from the scene of the disaster.

If se=
lected, the volunteer researcher will be mailed a small amount of
material =
associated with the aircraft crash in question.  This crash
debris was obta=
ined after all litigation was complete and a salvage
company had purchased =
all debris from the airline company.
Note: There are no health hazards asso=
ciated with the debris.
Note: The detailed information about the crash is n=
ot being giving at
this time in order to make it a controlled ITC experimen=
t.  This way the
audio files I receive from participants may or may not con=
tain
information about those who perished or information about their life. =
 I
alone know that information at this time.

It won't take much of your ti=
me.  All I ask from the selected
researchers are five, 30 second audio file=
s of attempted spirit contact,
using a method of the researcher's choice.  =
The crash debris you will be
provided must be used in association with the =
attempted contacts. (Close
proximity to the recording device is encouraged.=
)
You can e-mail me the audio files, along with a text explanation of how
t=
he files were captured when you complete you research. (Method used,
how de=
bris was used, etc.)

If you are interested in volunteering, please send me=
 a private e-mail
through this forum and tell me a bit about yourself and w=
hat method you
currently use.  If you are one of those selected I will repl=
y to your
e-mail, asking for a mailing address to send the object debris (w=
hich
will arrive in a small padded envelope.)  I don't need the debris back=
,
so keep it if you wish...

Thanks!

Below is some information about the video.
A new =
documentary coming in early 2009
"Voices From The Scorched Earth"... A para=
normal documentary ("Paradoc")
about contact with those who perished in a c=
ommercial jetliner crash
which claimed all on-board.
The 4g+ crash impact b=
eing so violent, all passengers and crew died
instantly.  They had only a m=
atter of seconds prior to their terrifying
vertical plunge. Witnesses descr=
ibed the aftermath scene as more
gruesome than they had ever experienced.
S=
ome say spirit communication is more likely to occur if a person had
suffer=
ed a quick, tragic death, with minimal time to prepare but enough
time for =
emotional thought and feelings to run high, such as what
happened in this t=
ragic accident.
The incident took only seconds, but according to the offici=
al report
there was enough time for very high emotion to have been felt by =
the
passengers and crew.
With this theory in mind,  Mike will perform ITC s=
essions at the scene
of the crash (exact impact point), and will be using o=
bjects from the
crash as part of some ITC sessions.
During ITC sessions a n=
umber of paranormal devices will be used, some
designed by Mike and current=
ly in the prototype stage.
Mike will begin filming "Voices From The Scorche=
d Earth" in late
December 2008.  Watch for this Paradoc on his Youtube webs=
ite
(Youtube.com/ufogeek), early in 2009.
