Look guys don't read anything into it. Frank and Chris have had a "on again=
, off again" relationship as long as they have known each other. I normally=
 don't speak up for Sumption, he is quite capable of speaking for himself b=
ut I thought I would head this off before imaginations got away from you al=
l. 
=A0
If he wants you to know his business he will let you know. I feel y=
ou overstep your bounds to expect an explanation.

"People also have a misconception that Mr. Sumption and I are at =

Maybe Frank could shed some more light on=
