Christine,    Welcome aboard!!!  
   
                   I currently do convential recordings with all of my boxes, just by simply seting the recorder next to the speaker when doing a session.  Depending on the recorder, I just download it to the computer via your audio program.  If you don't have a usb cord with your computer, purchase a patch cord from Radio Shack and that should do the trick!  
   
                   Mike and many others here use additional things to enhance the best out of their sessions, such as putting them in boxes, additional white noise, (such as water, ceiling fans ect.).  I suggest to try many different things and find out what suites you best!
   
                     I'm looking forward to your clips!
   
  Juli

I am taking psychic development, numerology, tarot, chakras,
mediumship etc.

I have seen ghosts since I was 5.

Interested in evps. I bought the radio shack radio last night and I
hacked it. I need to know what else I need to do evps and download
them into my pc.

Thank you for the help.
hugs
