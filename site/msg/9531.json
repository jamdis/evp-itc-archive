My first\n&gt; response was when I first got my radio and tested it out.\n&gt; Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t recording. I could have sworn that after I said\n&gt; Hi and introduced myself that someone said &quot;Hi Aaron.&quot; Anyways, I\n&gt; posted the files in Aaron&#39;s Files under 12-469 New model. The link is \n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Aaron%27s%20Files/12-469%20New%20Model/\n&gt; \n&gt; -Aaron\n&gt;\n\nHas it ever occurred to you, that some one or organisation, could be\nusing a radio to say the things you heard?\n\nThis whole radio and spirit voices, could be a MASSIVE HOAX,\nperpetuated by some one with a sophisticated multi-transmission two\nway radio.\n\nThink about it.\n\nTHAT IS WHY I USE EVPmaker only to commuincate with the other dimension."}
