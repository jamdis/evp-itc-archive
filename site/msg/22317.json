I Haven&#39;t been on here in a while, but am wondering what the P-SB7 is????   I have used a sony cassett tape recorder and mic and gotten EVPs + a digital recorder and the Radio shack &quot;hack&quot; with speakers added and taped that . . . not much results, but did get a few!!!  Thanks!   =Judy="}
