I am \ncurious as to whether or not this could in fact be affilated with a \npast or former life.  That at one time Frank S. could have been of \nroyality and I could in fact have had siblings.\n\nHow far fetched is it that we could be actually talking to spirits we \nonce had a relationship with or if that is even possible.\n\nI would welcome any imput on my wild and crazy thoughts!\n\nThanks!\nJuli"}
