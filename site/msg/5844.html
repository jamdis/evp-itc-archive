Gab,

I have never personally recieved a future prediction  other than them telling 
me the phone will ring or that I will recieve a  call or similar things.

From what I can gather they have certain  rules that they must follow as far 
as what they can relay in communication  with us. I assume the reason for 
this is 
that if they do give us a  prediction of the future and we even attempt to 
act upon it
that may cause  us to adversly alter the events that would or should take  
place.

I believe they call it the butterfly  effect.

Bruce

I listened to your Frak Box files this morning. You ask  the tech 
question on 2008. They said they didn't know. Have they ever  given you 
a future prediction say a year or two  away?
