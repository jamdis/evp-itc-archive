Right now I am waiting  until Radio Shack guy gets in h=\r\nis \nwireless cards so, I can get the Alltel  wireless on my PC.  For the pa=\r\nst 3 \nyears I&#39;ve had a Satellite  service because I live in the woods.   AT=\r\nT does \nnot have DSL out  here yet for the dial up, and probably never will=\r\n, close as \nthey come with DSL  is half mile away behind me in town.  So, f=\r\nor now I am \nstill  stuck with the analog phone line for the PC, since my S=\r\natellite was  \nacting up so bad  I recently just discontinued them, they wa=\r\nnted to charge  \nme to come out here, and fix their equipment, it hasn&#39;t be=\r\nen working right \nfor  over a year now, and my contract with them has been =\r\nover with for over 2 \nyears,  and I really didn&#39;t want to sign back up with=\r\n them.\n \nThe wireless company has a huge tower right  across the road on to=\r\np of this \nhill here so, I should be able to get good  reception.  I got to=\r\n send my \nlittle 12- 125 radio out to someone  on the list to &quot;hack&quot; for me=\r\n.   Gee,  if \nonly the Radio Shack  people knew that their little RS-12-470=\r\n dynamo were \nactually good for something,  they would probably turn them o=\r\nut like hot \ncakes, eh?  They actually got  bad reviews from people buying =\r\nthem,  customers  \nclaimed the battery  life, and reception in them was poo=\r\nr, lol so RS \ndiscontinued making them due to  the bad reviews.\n \nAs for Re=\r\nv. L Lee, she&#39;s probably having too  much fun over there to be \nwanting to =\r\nchat with me.  In life her voice was  very soft and light to hear \nnormally=\r\n, except when a spirit took  her body  over, then her voice changed to \nbe =\r\nlike whomever was speaking through her at the  time, be it a man or a \nwoma=\r\nn.   I was a real sceptic,  so the  only way I know her to have been legit =\r\n\nis because they had to prove it to me,  and they sure did.  It was not \nal=\r\nways the same person that came through her  either, like some of the phoney=\r\n&#39;s \nout there today, she was the real McCoy, she  was not out for glory, sh=\r\ne \nwasn&#39;t out to make any money, in the 30&#39;s they had  standing room only, =\r\non \nSunday, and they had people clear out the doors of that  Church, before=\r\n she died \nthough, there were only a handful of people, 11 people  left sti=\r\nll living, \nall the other member&#39;s died off, and after she died, her  Sermo=\r\nns were \nplayed for a few years, (btw, every single Sermon taped on the old=\r\n  Real to Real \nover 2500 of them, were given by direct voice from some spi=\r\nrit from  the \nother side).  She would start out with one small KJ verse an=\r\ny where in  the \nBible, and they took over a second later, and would make a=\r\n  half hour Sermon \nfrom that one tiny Scripture verse.\n \nAfter she died, p=\r\neople in that Church getting  elderly themselves died off \nas well, her son=\r\n sold the Church building for I  think a dollar to another \ngroup, it was a=\r\n huge old, old dark stone  beautiful building, been around for \nover 100 ye=\r\nars back then,  there was a  huge colored glass window of \nMichael the arc =\r\nangel with an inscription that  reads as follows, &quot;In enlarging \nparadise, =\r\nlives a life that never dies,  when ye come where I have stepped  ye \nwill =\r\nwonder why ye wept,&quot; and they  donated that Window to the Detroit \nInstitut=\r\ne of Art&#39;s Museum down  state which is still there to this day.   I \nguess =\r\nI was just  privileged to have known them, and got to be a part of the \nwho=\r\nle experience so,  I know beyond any doubt there is life after death, and \n=\r\none does  not need to even have faith when one knows something.\n \nThis tiny=\r\n 5 foot lady Rev. Lee never missed a  Sunday for the 60 years she \nwas ther=\r\ne, she with a pace maker for over 30 years,  angina, could barely \nstand fo=\r\nr very long, but when she got up there to give her  talk, no paper was \neve=\r\nr used, she never studied a thing, read her Sermon&#39;s, they  had no \npaper, =\r\nonly an open KJ Bible in front of her, one minute later, she had  some \nspi=\r\nrit from over there take her body over, I don&#39;t know how, they just did,  \n=\r\nand she had energy, she could stand unassisted, move around, everything, it=\r\n \nwas  like she had become young again, this is a lady that had been in a c=\r\nar \naccident,  a bad heart, she was almost 86 years old, it is unreal what =\r\nthese \nspirit&#39;s are  able to do when they are on a mission.  It&#39;s like noth=\r\ning can \nstop them,  the only money the Church got was via a collection pla=\r\nte, and \nfrom the  collection, they could barely heat the place, most peopl=\r\ne put in a \ndollar of  two, or a few coins, she never, never asked for mone=\r\ny,  they had a \nSunday  service one in morning, and after noon class, and t=\r\nhe evening \nService.  On  Wednesday people could come to her house if they =\r\nwanted for a prayer \nmeeting,  Thursday at her home she had a class, I&#39;m te=\r\nlling this because \nshe did this  without making any money for it all.  Peo=\r\nple could give \ndonation&#39;s if they  wanted, but she never pressed anyone fo=\r\nr money.   Spirit used to \nsay,  &quot; a baby must first be given baby food, no=\r\nt steak because they can&#39;t  \ndigest  it&quot; I guess, a person can&#39;t be told so=\r\nmething before they  are \nready so maybe this is why we human&#39;s were not al=\r\nlowed to know certain  things.  \nSorry to take up your time with this, but =\r\nI just wanted to tell  you more \nabout her, she told me that over there a p=\r\nerson that dies when they are  old \ncan appear young if they want, sometime=\r\ns though to be recognized by people  \nstill living on Earth they appear mat=\r\nerialize like they were last  known to \nlook.  I don&#39;t want to bog down the=\r\n list, and by now you are all  thinking \nme to be a fruit loop or something=\r\n. lol\nsf\n \n\nIn a message dated 5/6/2009 3:53:15 A.M.

Vicki  & Margaret are corr=\r\nect about everything.  These two ladies have \nso  much experience in this f=\r\nield and I recommend following their advice. \nThey  won=E2=80=99t steer you=\r\n wrong J!!  I am so  happy you were able to find us.  I am \nof the belief t=\r\nhat you are lead to  things and you were lead to us and the \nwork here.  \nI=\r\n see you were  offered a used Mini Box from LK (Ghuny) on the other board. =\r\n\n Boxes are  passed from one researcher to another all the time without any=\r\n \nproblems so if  you have the financial ability I say go for it!  (BTW.. o=\r\nnly \nFrank=E2=80=99s Boxes are called Frank=E2=80=99s  Boxes.  The Paranorm=\r\nal System=E2=80=99s boxes \nare called Mini=E2=80=99s and the Radio  Shack r=\r\nadios are called Hacks (just to keep \nthem all  straightJ).  Once a  transf=\r\ner has occurred between researchers the \nbox will usually will speak  about=\r\n the exchange..  and they usually work \ngreat for the new  owner. \nBut sinc=\r\ne you already  own the 125 Hack why not give that a go for a bit.  \nGetting=\r\n it hacked is  a pretty simple process and I am happy that you have \nsomeon=\r\ne to do it for  you.  When I first started I went and bought all these \ncab=\r\nles and such  and tried to connect speakers and recorders and etc.  But \nBr=\r\nuce  straightened me out and said =E2=80=98hack the radio =E2=80=93 turn on=\r\n your handheld \nrecorder  =E2=80=93 turn on your radio (with speaker if nee=\r\nded) and go!=E2=80=99  So I held \na Hack  in one hand and a recorder in ano=\r\nther and I was off.  It was and \nstill is  a very simple process with no ne=\r\ned to attach wires or anything.  It \nmakes  it a very mobile process and I =\r\nam able to walk around to find the \nbest  location for reception.  My recor=\r\nder attaches directly into my computer=E2=80=99s \n USB port so I don=E2=80=\r\n=99t even need a wire to connect that to download my audio \ninto  my softwa=\r\nre.  But if your recorder does needs a wire that is still \njust a  simple U=\r\nSB cable between the recorder and the computer. And as Margaret \n suggested=\r\n if you have a microphone on your computer then you can do your  \nsessions =\r\nin front of your computer and record directly and not have to \nupload  anyt=\r\nhing.  I personally need the  mobility because reception is poor \nwhere I l=\r\nive and walking around to find the  best spot works for me=E2=80=A6  \nI use=\r\n Goldwave Audio  Software but Audacity is free online shareware and it \nis =\r\nquite good too.   If you would like a copy of Goldwave I can get it to \nyou=\r\n (I have shared the  .exe file with several others.)  All you need is a \nSK=\r\nYPE account because  it allows the exchange of .exe files.  Let me know.   =\r\n\nYou are such a  wonderful addition to our growing family.  You have been \n=\r\ndealing with  spirit for what.. 40 years at least (since the late 60s?)!
