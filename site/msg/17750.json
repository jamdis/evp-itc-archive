Here I was blissfully thinking it was just that the Mayans ran out of space on their calendar.\n\n&gt; \n&gt;  Fortunately, I remain intrigued with EVP just because something talks that shouldn&#39;t be there, I don&#39;t really care what they say. \n&gt; \n\n--- I&#39;m interested in this for both reasons: I want to understand why they talk to us, and I&#39;m also interested in what they&#39;re saying, whether it&#39;s true or false in our world, and whether they&#39;re talking directly to us, or sometimes we&#39;re eavesdropping on their conversations, elsewhere.\n\nI&#39;m leaving open the possibility that, in their world/universe, something did happen on June 17th, and this was one of those eavesdropping moments... or two or three.\n\n\n&gt;  Then there&#39;s the problem that nothing is written in stone, it is often changable, or maybe just a probability/possiblity.\n&gt; \n\n--- Exactly! The influence of the observer can be significant.  But, that&#39;s what I keep reminding people who take their horoscopes far too seriously:  Sometimes, logical consequences (good and bad) seem to be unavoidable.  Everything _else_ seems to open doors, but what actually happens may be heavily influenced by the person&#39;s outlook (attitude or &quot;observer&quot; factor)... or perhaps that proverbial butterfly in China changed everything and nobody expected it.\n\nCheerfully,\nFiona"}
