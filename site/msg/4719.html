<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Phew. I was afraid for a minute that you were an adherent of that  
remote viewer who says that he&#x27;s seen that that we&#x27;re all an here  
because the aliens are growing us for our souls.

&gt; I didn&#x27;t intend for either to be ominous. I just think we don&#x27;t  
&gt; know who
&gt; we&#x27;re really comunicating with through the boxes. It could be space
&gt; aliens for all we know. They definitely don&#x27;t sound like the EVP&#x27;s  
&gt; I&#x27;ve
&gt; gotten in haunted places. They are in a class by themselves. Maybe  
&gt; we&#x27;ll
&gt; know for sure some day.
&gt;
&gt; As for the loved ones, I personally think they hang around for the
&gt; funeral, then they&#x27;re off into a new baby body as fast as they can  
&gt; go. The
&gt; ones who hang around and become ghosts are probably in the less  
&gt; than 1%
&gt; category of people who do that. The rest are growing up with new  
&gt; parents
&gt; somewhere and getting to believe in Santa Claus (or whatever) again.
&gt; :-)

&gt; &gt;&gt; Ominous? It depends on which side of the fence your on? I have  
&gt; been in a
&gt; &gt;&gt; position
&gt; &gt;&gt; of asking for Angels / Gods protection after sensing what was  
&gt; perceived as
&gt; &gt;&gt; evil.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Good and evil / Light &amp; darkness can not exist in the same  
&gt; space. You can&#x27;t
&gt; &gt;&gt; have
&gt; &gt;&gt; one without the other. Negativity will always be overpowered by  
&gt; Good &amp;
&gt; &gt;&gt; darkness
&gt; &gt;&gt; will always be illuminated by the light. Negative entities will  
&gt; try to lie
&gt; &gt;&gt; and / or mislead?
&gt; &gt;&gt; You can&#x27;t always know who your dealing with, but that&#x27;s part of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; investigating process,
&gt; &gt;&gt; isn&#x27;t it? Asking &amp; Trying to determine who your dealing with?

&gt; &gt;&gt; That sounds quite ominous, Zack. Not sure I like the sound of  
&gt; it. What is
&gt; &gt;&gt; your theory?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; We actually don&#x27;t know who we&#x27;re communicating with using the  
&gt; boxes. I
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; suspect it isn&#x27;t what we traditionally call a &quot;ghost&quot;.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I also suspect that people are not hearing their loved ones.  
&gt; The loved
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; oneshave probably been elsewhere for some time ...

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I personally have seen Chris use his box in public forum four  
&gt; times.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have heard the box give audible yes and no type answers to  
&gt; peoples
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; questions. I do feel though that the ones that get emotionally  
&gt; moved
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the most are the ones wanting with all their heart to hear from a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; loved one. When these people get an answer that may or may not be
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heard by all, they feel that it is indeed from a loved one and it
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hits them in the heart as if it was real. I would love to hear a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recorded session from start to finish as an investigator.  
&gt; After all
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this research is for all not just &quot;30&quot;.... :-)
