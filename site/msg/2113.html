<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>hey guy&#x27;s,

I have been doing a few sessions
everyday and starting to get very clear responses. I am starting to 
believe that certain
spirits or entities attach themselves to a particular boxes frequency 
and look for that boxes signature. The spirits coming through #12 
seem to be wondering why they are not talking to Frank, and there is 
a new person using the box. because it seems like they are confused 
about where the box is and who is using it but they are slowly with 
some explanation on my part starting to get the idea that the box has 
a new user.

Also the spirits that were communicating with me when I was doing the 
manual FM sweep sessions are now starting to come through box 12. 
And I believe they are helping the spirits that may be already 
attached to this box understand the box is in a different place with 
a different user. What led me to believe this theory is the first few 
sessions the entities were asking where frank aka purple was. Also 
Steve Hultay when he received box 13 from frank originally began 
getting questions and statements from the spirits about Colorado 
where Frank lives.

I will continue to talk with them about the attachment to a certain 
box and hope they will do the research on their side which I&#x27;m sure 
they will and we can come up with a solid answer.

I&#x27;ll keep you all posted.
