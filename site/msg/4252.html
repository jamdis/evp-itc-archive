 All should be careful of using other researchers names when being critical.
 
 If anyone is getting threats of "legal action", I suggest it be reported to the FBI, so at least a pattern can be established. I'm pretty sure most of this stuff comes from out of a persons home state, that makes it federal. Slander is not even applicable to the internet, so threats of slander suits are harrassment to keep people from contradicting certain claims and research in this field, and as such, criminal. Although these criminals think they can say whatever they want about the rest of us. I suggest just let it go, and let the evidence speak for itself. 
 
 These people that would like to keep all this research private, and for their own use are in fact in this group. To keep them off I would have to make this a private group, or no group at all, and that's not fair to the world. As I find out who these people are, that are in the groop under false pretenses, they will be banned. 
 
 If I feel threatened, or intimidated again, I will take appropriate action, and it won't involve whinning!  I can grow a pair even at my age!
