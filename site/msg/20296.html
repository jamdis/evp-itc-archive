<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My 2 cents is that it&#x27;s MUCH easier to shoot down an idea as being useless than it is to prove that it may have some merit.
It&#x27;s just less work to be a know-it-all that debunks everything, than it is to actually prove the vearcity of some phenomenon.
They all laughed at Chris Columbus!!!!!!!!!!!!
Copernicus
Galileo
Einstein
etc. etc. etc.
A lot of people with great ideas were chortled at in their lifetimes.
No amount of proof will EVER convince someone who firmly believes, or doesn&#x27;t believe, in something.

&gt;  I think these skeptics purpose is to keep main stream science from looking
&gt; at certain taboo subjects, almost like a religion trying to keep itself
&gt; pure. It aslmost has to be the universities that fund these people,
&gt; otehrwise why would they waste their time, unless they are so lame this is
&gt; the only way they can make a name for themselves. Science in this country is
&gt; mostly out dated dogma that they pass off a absolute irrefutable gospel
&gt; truth that must not be questioned, as if all is known, and all has been
&gt; discovered.

&gt; &gt; I thought true skeptics were supposed to be logical, open-minded
&gt; &gt; people who have doubts until they&#x27;re presented with evidence that would
&gt; &gt; dispel such doubts.  She&#x27;s not a skeptic but a blind, fanatical
&gt; &gt; non-believer.  That&#x27;s too bad.
