That being said, I do believe that people should be\ncompensated for both their time and their energy. We all must eat.\nHowever, when it is a blatant attempt at over compensation, I take issue. \nI commend Frank on his altruistic motives. I have not had the pleasure\nof meeting Frank but it is easy to see that his intentions are pure. I\nknow Chris and find him to be an incredibly genuine person. According\nto Konstanin Raudives communications after death, this would explain\ntheir success in using this device. \nTruly, I can only see problems with the mas production of the device.\nIf it is true that dissonance in the form of fear, doubt,\nill-intention, etc opens the pathway to lower dimensions then what\nmight happen when people everywhere are turning on and tuning in? What\nmight happen when the mentally unstable person receives, or perceives\nto receive, a message requesting an evil or dark deed? \nI can not convey in words my concern with this being produced in such\na manner. Fraud of unsuspecting people is going to abound. Ego&#39;s are\nnot going to allow for the admittance that the box is not working for\nthem. They will deliver fake messages, deceiving people for money.\nThis can only harm the credibility of the work that Frank, Chris and\nothers are doing. IMHO, the makers of this mini-box have given no\nthought or consideration to the possible outcome. If they have, they\nhave chosen to ignore it. \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; If it&#39;s getting others to use the technology and experiment and find\nout \n&gt; what&#39;s out there, it&#39;s at least doing that.

I&#39;ve even run off some pc boards and \n&gt; given them away free. I would tend to do that in this area (ITC) too as \n&gt; long as it doesn&#39;t break me.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I see your point. I guess they&#39;re just not altruistic like Frank\nS. is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, 16 Nov 2007, Frank Ratka wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; How can it advance the technology if he doesn&#39;t share the design?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank R.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
