<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I like the personal audio clips too.  However, the fact is for those 
who don&#x27;t check their e-mail all day long and when they get home they 
have 80 e-mails and 50 of them are just announcements to files.  I do 
listen to them also and enjoy it, but maybe we can limit the files to 
a few instead of a lot at one time.  It also seems like the board 
freed up a lot of space as well, so people can start posting on this 
board again.  The e-snips thing is cool, but it&#x27;s better all on the 
same board and i think the space is available now to do that.  I 
personally listened to all your posts Bruce and so did a lot of 
others i&#x27;m sure.  Maybe there wasn&#x27;t a lot in that batch to comment 
on for people.  Some you hear and some you don&#x27;t, i personally don&#x27;t 
hear a lot of what you post with no disrespect.  Do you want 200 
people responding &quot;I didn&#x27;t hear that&quot; to some of the files or &quot;Yeah 
Good One&quot;.  I can make out other files only if you label them and i&#x27;m 
waiting for the file to say that and i think you proved that with 
your experiment with unlabeled files that no one got the right answer 
to.  The fact is people hear different things all the time.Your files 
sound very much like traditional EVP and are hard to make out 
sometimes, but sometimes you hit on some good ones too.   You have 
stated in a personal e-mail to not respond to any of your files, and 
i&#x27;ve honored your request but if you allow me to comment on the files 
you post i will.  It seems there are only a couple that respond to 
files here, but i&#x27;m sure others listen as well and don&#x27;t comment.  I 
will be more than happy to add to to the group discussions on your 
files, but the couple people that always respond to your files have 
nothing but praise and i disagree sometimes.

&gt; Bruce, 
&gt;               I have to agree with you.  Given the file folder 
shortage, I deleted all of my files to give the new comers room.  I 
hated to do that, given if anyone wanted to revert back to my clips, 
they could in fact do so and now that can&#x27;t.   I also hate to have to 
send someone a link to find my audio on an additional sight.  
&gt;    
&gt;               Maybe we could comprise and say after &quot;x&quot; amount of 
days, upon new files being uploaded we could clean house?  I know 
that not everyone will take it upon themselves to do this, but if 
they don&#x27;t (after an announcement from the groups caretakers), if 
they disappear, its their own fault.
&gt;    
&gt;                I personally like the single emails announcing each 
file.  I can go straight to the audio clip and not have to search 
through previous clips I have already listened to.  
&gt;    
&gt;   Just my thoughts!

&gt;           Yesterday I decided to post some files so I posted to a 
sub folder of 
&gt; my main folder in the files section.
&gt; I noticed that some people voiced their dislike of sending post 
notices 
&gt; for every file , so I sent none. Just a single post stating that I 
had 
&gt; posted the files and where they could be found.
&gt; 
&gt; Now this is the dilemma, If you do not post an announcement for 
each 
&gt; file and you trust that the single post announcing all the files 
that 
&gt; have been posted will suffice, well I don&#x27;t think so!
&gt; 
&gt; I know that most individuals here do not listen to or reply to 
every 
&gt; single file posted but I will usually get some comments on the 
better 
&gt; or more interesting ones. So far from the posting yesterday &quot;NADA&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone saw the post I wrote announcing the files I posted to the 
&gt; files section, please for my own satisfaction let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; Otherwise I don&#x27;t think the one post notice thing is gonna cut it!
