I forgot to answer: No, I have not given up ghost hunting at all, but over the years I have come to focus more on the collection and distribution of experiences than on encountering phenomena myself.  ITC has really affirmed this for me.\n  I&#39;ve felt all along that my job is to make people aware that spiritual phenomena go on all the time in millions of lives; I&#39;m not a scientist and I know nothing I do will change the way science thinks.  BUT if I can open the minds of young people today, perhaps our future scientists will make it their business to figure all this out.  \n  I know this is a lot of what ITC experimenters are doing: convincing others of the afterlife by their recorded evidence.  Amazing things can happen when THAT happens.  \n  Again, Mark Macy is so wonderful because he has dedicated his life to this.  He and his colleagues have received such detailed descriptions of how the afterlife works, that they have helped the living change their lives to erase the fear of death--and to live in a way that brings us to as high a spiritual level as possible right away when our bodies die.  This means, for example, dealing with issues and addictions, that plague us in life, since the spirits tell us we take it all with us!  That is, death isn&#39;t a cure-all.\n  Any glimpse at the history of ITC shows us that all of this has been gradually growing since the 19th century, when state-of-the-art graphite pencils and telegraphs were used to contact the dead.  Since then, there have been &quot;breakthroughs&quot; a number of times when astounding floods of messages have come through.\n  You experimenters are all so incredible--I&#39;m amazed every day at your love, dedication and faith.  Surely something wonderful is going to come from all this, and I think it&#39;s going to come during our lifetimes.\n   \n  Ursula\n   \n   \n  \nRobin Searcy Henson &lt;MudPuddleFarm@...&gt; wrote:\n              Hello Bill,\n   \n  Yes, I did steal that phrase from Ursula because I thought it described what I was doing as compared to what I would like to be doing!\n   \n  I like what you said about focus on the equipment helping to establish the psychic connection.
