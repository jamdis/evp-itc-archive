I don&#39;t know why why, but that stuff really chaps my hide!\n&gt;\n&gt;  I know for a fact that some of the voices out of the box, and other\n&gt; methods are imagination, as they tend to change from day to as perceptions\n&gt; shift. I have stuff form ten years ago that sound the same, and I aslo have\n&gt; tapes from the first boxes that talk about what&#39;s going on now.
