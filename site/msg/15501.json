Some guy at the  \nend saying his name as Jerry, then a fella saying&quot; rabbit creek.&quot;  I know  \nhis dad, &quot;jack&quot; was a trapper for awhile, but he built some natural dens for \n rabbits, beaver, and fox, he liked to hunt deer and bear, but all the deer \nwere  coming over here, so he gave that up, and was no longer hunting his \nown land  next door.  Jack was just a young guy when he got cancer and died \nfew years  ago, a couple years after my mom died.
