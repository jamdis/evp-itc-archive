<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Nice, interesting files, Bruce.  

You and FS (his post today) got me wondering about this time no more 
thing...not to mention I heard similar statements of urgency over my RS 
box set-up, too.  

Any more ideas regarding this, Bruce...FS...others?  I personally 
believe time to be illusion, and I also know it is written &quot;time will 
be no more&quot; (biblical future prophecy).

Still not sure where I fall with this, other than I do agree on this 
urgency, elevating consciousness, etc

&gt; Hey boy&#x27;s and girls,
&gt; 
&gt; Here are some new Frank&#x27;s box files. You may find the ones about 
sweep 
&gt; rate interesting.
&gt; 
&gt; There are quite a few good ones, New researchers please take note of 
&gt; the different sound between Frank&#x27;s box and the RS boxes. The 
operation 
&gt; of the box and the sound and files it produces are very unique to 
each 
&gt; FB.
