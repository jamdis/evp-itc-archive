<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, IU use google, and on the top of the e-mail page there is &quot;attach
file&quot;, I just click that, browse to the file, and double click it. With
outlook, you just copy and paste.

&gt; Hi Guys,
&gt; Now I know just enough about computers to be dangerous (to my repairman),
&gt; this ain&#x27;t no joke...just ask him (when he ain&#x27;t busy) :)
&gt; So HOW is it that you guys are adding your EVP examples as an ATTACHMENT?
&gt; Looks all nice and neat. And doesn&#x27;t take up File Storage Space I &quot;assume&quot;.
&gt; Definitely much better to have it all on one page instead of running to my
&gt; folder. Can send as personal text. Thanks. **I&#x27;ve received quite a few EVP
