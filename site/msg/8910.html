files. I forward this for two reasons: the first as a request from 
Bruce to determine recurring words and second because I wanted to 
have experienced ears hear my recording for comments. Regarding the 
test, this is just 30 secs or so of a 7 minute recording. Recorded 
at 90% using EVPmaker with xcross. I was able to hear "art and 
arthor" a number of times within the 7 minutes. This is after 
requesting no names be spoken.

nothing but evp gibberish. I ask that anyone with an ear for this to 
give a listen and tell me if you hear anything intelligent. I am in 
a terrible radio zone here in Mexico so I have high hopes on EVP 
maker and the file Stefan provided. Also excited about the fact that 
so many others are getting excellent communications. Thank you to 
anyone who takes the time to listen to and confirm my recordings. I 
am beginning to feel like I am being blocked out like William had 
thought. Maybe I am in a true dead zone, no pun intended, or "they" 
don't want me in the loop for some reason. Ron L

have done a few sessions with this method as I know a few other 
researchers have.There have been a couple of researchers that have 
done sessions and gotten very similar responses such as the 
name "Arthur" and responses pertaining to "Air" also "I am here" 
or "here".I have also gotten direct and intelligible answers to 
questions immediately following the question, and messages that could 
never be construed as random.The test that I propose and the answer I 
seek is, The words that keep coming up to almost all researchers 
experimenting with this method IE the words I mentioned above.I would 
like to find out whether these certain words are simply by products 
of everyone using the same file and come up as a result of the file 
playing in evpm, or are they true entity communication.The only 
questionable content are these few words not all the methods 
communication. In my opinion the majority of the communication from 
this method is genuine.The method has produced communication 
including my name to me as well as other researchers that have gotten 
my name, and some of the statements and responses show signs of a 
sense of humor that would surely be absent in random word 
grouping.Who ever is involved with experimentation of this method, 
will you please on your next session ask that if there is a spirit 
named Arthur for him not to mention his name or the list of words 
that I have posted. I suggest that this request be made verbally 
before the session as well as after.And in the most polite manner. 
They seem to respond better to formality.please dedicate one session 
no shorter than 2 minutes to this experiment and post your 
results.Your cooperation appreciated.Bruce
