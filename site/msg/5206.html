Sounds like a wild idea but I will try.  I did manage to get more signals on my radio than I thought possible but I had to stand out near a mosquito infested area at night where there was a metal frame structure that seemed to help bring signals to me.  If anyone on the other side responds it will probably be all chuckles and laughs when they see what I am doing.
  I got about five good bites---mosquitos.  I would like to send you a one minute raw audio copy of what I recorded.  I can't really make out any responses but I thought maybe you can tell if the signal quality seems o.k. to your ears.  Would you be able to listen and give me your opinion?   Ron L

          Ron,

I was speaking to Juli Velazquez Last night and she reminded me that 
when she got started with the RS box she had horrible reception. She 
had come up with the idea of running the RS 469 through a telivision 
set via audio cables with the red and white conectors at one end and a 
3.5 mm jack at the other.

just plug the red and whote plugs into the corresponding audio in or 
video in ports on your tv. switch the tv to video as if you where using 
a dvd player or video game console and turn on the RS box.

This will run the RS signal through the tv, Juli has had better 
reception using this method. Give it a try and let us know how it goes.
