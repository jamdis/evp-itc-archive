I \nrecently bumped into one of the names they have been mentioning and I \nthought they meant someone who passed. Then I run across someone with \nthe same name who is becoming involved in the ITC field of study. So \nI asked my group there why they have expressed such an interest in \nhim. Someone (alive) mentioned it&#39;s because he is into studying \nreverse speech and has trained his ears to hear it. I have to agree \nhe definitely hears things out of my ranges, and his methods totally \ndiffer from my own. They only gave me a few clear answers to my \nquestion and one of them is the first attached file. Hope you can \nhear it easily because for me it is very clear. Probably one of the \nclearest so far. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   The rest of the attachments are other entities who popped in the \nconversation and some of thier chat was directed at each other. As \nfor the a-hole thing on the last part when it mentioned other mouths \nto talk I had a flashback of Ace Ventura bending over making his butt \ncheeks talk, I dont know why but I found it funny. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Yes sometimes they argue amongst themselves, or bump into \nentities they know and carry on conversations.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Misty\n\nJust heard that undertaker recording of your Misty -- very clear! I \nwonder what it means?"}
