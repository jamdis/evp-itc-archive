 I got home last night, and digging around the shop wondering what else I =
had, still seeking something with better performance, and came up with some=
thing I tried a couple years ago. Just another chip, but it seemed like it =
worked better, if my memory isn't too defective. I already had a board made=
 using that AM/FM chip that was just way too noisy on AM, so ripped out the=
 radio section, and put on a new chip. I don't remeber why I didn't use thi=
s chip for any actual boxes.  I won't have it working till sometime this we=
ekend. Guess this would be 33, and I think I have an addiction to building =
this stuff, instead of using it. 
 
 The pix is what breadboarding is.
