<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi guys, I&#x27;m still here, reading all of your posts and listening to  
your EVPs. I haven&#x27;t had much time to spend much time with my Shack  
Hack, still intend to.

Just wanted to add I was pleased to hear about Darkness Radio  
auctioning off the hacks. I&#x27;ve been to a few of their events, and they  
are all about raising money for charity (and yes, ghost hunting). They  
put on these 2 day events at different locations (I&#x27;ve been to theirs  
at the Waverly, Stanley and Queen Mary (in December)) and they always  
have a dinner the first night with an auction. The guests (usually  
around 200) bid on various items and like at any fundraiser end up  
paying way more than an item is worth simply because they want to  
donate to a good cause. Dave Schrader, the Darkness Radio host, is  
usually the auctioneer and he has a spectacular sense of humor.  
Everyone has a blast. They usually raise around $15,000 or better and  
donate to different reputable charities. They are a great, fun bunch  
of people and the events are extremely enjoyable for me because you  
get to rub elbows with ghost hunting celebs, meet a lot of nice  
people, get into places you can&#x27;t investigate as an individual and  
(the best part) attend lectures also given by various celebs and  
experts (such as Rosemary Guiley, Jason &amp; Grant, Chris Fleming,  
Patrick Burns, etc.)

If you ever get the opportunity to join in on one of their &quot;retreats&quot;,  
don&#x27;t hesitate!

&gt; On the Queen Mary this week, the Darkness Radio event organizers asked
&gt; that I provide a couple of 12-469&#x27;s for their charity auction. The two
&gt; Shack Hack&#x27;s sold for a combined $260. Darkness Radio raised over
&gt; $17,000 on this event that was donated to a Los Angeles battered
&gt; woman&#x27;s shelter. The organizers have raised a healthy six figures for
&gt; various charities around the country. It&#x27;s always with representatives
&gt; from the recipient organization present and the checks and cash is
&gt; publicly counted and turned over to the representatives.
&gt;
&gt; The people that attend these events are always eager to learn about FB
&gt; and the other Boxes. The difference between this event and other
&gt; public demonstrations of the Box is that no one at the Darkness
&gt; event&#x27;s wants to personally profit from ITC. I explained how to hack
&gt; the 469&#x27;s and the folks who bought them during the auction knew these
&gt; were originally $24 radios but choose to help the auction while
&gt; getting a Shack Hack. Later on both nights a group gathered to
&gt; exchange ideas and listen and try to interpret for themselves what was
&gt; coming out of the Boxes.
