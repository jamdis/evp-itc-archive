&gt; I got my first successful recorded responses tonight. My first

&gt; Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t recording. I could have sworn that after I said
&gt; Hi and introduced myself that someone said &quot;Hi Aaron.&quot; Anyways, I
&gt; posted the files in Aaron&#x27;s Files under 12-469 New model. The link is

Has it ever occurred to you, that some one or organisation, could be
using a radio to say the things you heard?

This whole radio and spirit voices, could be a MASSIVE HOAX,
perpetuated by some one with a sophisticated multi-transmission two
way radio.

Think about it.

THAT IS WHY I USE EVPmaker only to commuincate with the other dimension.</pre>
