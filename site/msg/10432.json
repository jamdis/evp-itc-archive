Ex: I recently \nheard about a 40 year old man becoming so obsessive with playing a \nvideo game that he lost his job, his wife and kids, and had to move \nin with his parents!  Was it the devil?  No, he was just a dumb-ss!  \n\nI would rather suggest it possible that focusing all of one&#39;s time \nand attention to this (or anything) will bring negative behavior of \nsome sort...hell, watching too much TV, or living on the computer is \nnot healthy, I would suspect.\n\nIf people want protection, they should first seek having a healthy \nperspective on life in general, and attempt to have a balanced \nlifestyle.  I for one think that would solve most all issues for many \nof us.  \n\nI therefore wonder if the &quot;demons&quot; people fear are really creations \nfrom our own selfish, mis-thinking, obsessive-compulsive lifestyles - \nall self-created for personal gain and self-satisfaction.  ;)\n\nLC\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  Hi All; We have been warned by others from time to time about \nunbridled box use, as it supposedly brings in negativity. I don&#39;t \nwant to believe that, but there are a few cases of people using boxes \nmade by me, as well as the hack radios, and going whacko big time. \nIts&#39; either all ego--I&#39;m the onlyest one that can use this, or like \nthe more recent example. I don&#39;t know if these people were like this \nto start, or if it&#39;s an external influance, but it&#39;s discouraging. \nThere seems to be a similar reaction with systems not made by me--so \nI&#39;ve been told.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Soooo, maybe burn some white candles, and maybe get a Rosary. My \nguys talk about the Catholics, and the Purple Princess has a Catholic \nconnection on the etheric levels, although the church imposes too \nmany limits on her. I wouldn&#39;t want to go into a state of fear, but a \nlittle protection stuff couldn&#39;t hurt. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Not only do I not have the time to mass produce boxes, I&#39;m \nbeginning to think it&#39;s not a good idea anyway. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Express yourself wherever you are.
