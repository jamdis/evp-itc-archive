I am a member of your group, but also have my own\ngroup consisting of people that work to assist law\nenforcement/missing person organizations using their radios or\npsychic/medium skills.\n\nI am looking for volunteers to record with deceased victims to try\nand help solve cases managed by Nancy Angelbound.\n\nThese are cold case files.\n\nAnyone interested, please join my site and go to the links page to\nsee the cases. http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/SDWR-\nSpeakingToTheDeadWithRadios/?yguid=338683728\n\nWe ask you send your files to Nancy directly to ensure this\ninformation does not leak into public hands possibly causing harm to\nthe family or police investigation.\n\nNancy Angelbound will work with you directly and she will get the\ninfo you provide to proper authorities.\n\nFor your personal reward, you help the victim find closure, the\nfamily find closure and law enforcement close the case.\n\nPlease accept my invitation to help those in need, and thanks in\nadvance.\n\nMike Edwards"}
