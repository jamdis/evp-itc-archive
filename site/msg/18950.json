People get up in arms=\r\n \nwhen they don&#39;t understand the possibilities  I  guess.  It&#39;s so ironic w=\r\nhen \na few got upset last year about someone making  money off a box and ch=\r\narging \nthe public, because this person knew or could  hear what spirit wer=\r\ne \nsaying, and they could not so they had a fit.  And  this year same perso=\r\nn is now \nbetter in their eyes.  And here I  am referring many of my own ct=\r\n&#39;s. to join \nthese 3 lists, and risking  my own validity as a  spiritualist=\r\n psychic, just \nbecause I  am able to understand what a few cannot, and  pr=\r\netty much the \nsame  people,  are  up  in arms all over again.  I am not go=\r\ning to  refer any \nmore of my ct&#39;s  to join these lists anymore because of =\r\n last nights \nridicule.
