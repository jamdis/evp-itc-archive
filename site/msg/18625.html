&gt;  Everytime I&#x27;m about to drop all public interaction cuz of the idiot
&gt; skeptics that accept nothing, I get this kind of voice. As I switch to TRF a
&gt; voice says &quot;People do listen&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt;  Try to answer these skeptics and all they can do is accuse me of attacking
&gt; them, while they accept no evidence, no one else&#x27;s results, and break out
&gt; all smug and arrogant.  Nothing paranormal eh!? Well explain just how
&gt; something would know when I was going to switch and make a meaningful
&gt; comment at that instant.  Actually don&#x27;t bother explaining, I don&#x27;t wanna
&gt; hear your crap science answer.  Most thinking people here can see/hear there
&gt; is something to the paranormal and it is not imagination.
&gt; 
&gt;  This is what I call the &quot;History Box&quot; as I tried to incorporate all
&gt; functions I&#x27;ve been using into one unit. It almost works, been working on it
&gt; since last December. Arm Band tuner, TRF tuner, and car tuner, random and
&gt; linear sweep, random still needs work.
