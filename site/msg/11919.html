<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was responding to the comment that EVP is basically valueless as  
evidence.


 &gt;&gt;What difference would a recording make? Especially
Since in this research where we usually can&#x27;t see who or what
we&#x27;re talking to. Any voice we hear or record could be anything.

Looks like that was you. First up, I apologize for being too snippy,  
because I was. But I still have to stand by my point: if EVP isn&#x27;t  
good evidence in the vase of the Fish Group then all you have a  
witness testimony--also subject to being distorted over time and  
through channels--like playing telephone as a kid.

I think what is happening here is that I am trying to debate only  
about the Fish Group case (Are they dead people? Are they demons?),  
but its getting generalized.

I meant no disrespect, W. Chock it up to too much caffeine, bitch  
slap me, and hopefully we&#x27;re good.

&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s called &quot;evidence.&quot; Heard of it? All this talk about the Fish

&gt;&gt; its all a case of third-fourth-eight-hand testimony, slowly  
&gt;&gt; blowing out of proportion and reaching legendary status before you  
&gt;&gt; can say &quot;Bob&#x27;s your uncle.&quot; If there never was any EVP evidence  
&gt;&gt; we&#x27;d not even be calling them the Fish Group. They gave that name  
&gt;&gt; to themselves, through EVPs. If you don&#x27;t accept EVP as good--if  
&gt;&gt; not the best--evidence we have of paranormal communication, why  
&gt;&gt; are you here?

&gt;&gt; Some of us here have trying to approach this research in a logical  
&gt;&gt; and basically scientific way for many years. I, a least, will not  
&gt;&gt; start rolling in imaginative speculation on anyone&#x27;s whim.
