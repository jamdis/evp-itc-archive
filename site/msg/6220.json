I think I hear a track silenced, too.\n&gt; &gt; If so, why did you do that?&quot; Then I get to answer and explain why I\n&gt; &gt; did it that way, offer the raw clip, or whatever. It doesn&#39;t come\n&gt; off\n&gt; &gt; as a broad attack--just a friendly question. Even Bruce wouldn&#39;t rip\n&gt; &gt; out your living eyeballs for that. (Well... maybe he wouldn&#39;t,\n&gt; anyway.\n&gt; &gt; ;) )\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with your search for The Truth. I really do. That&#39;s why\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; see me get all rough-and-tumble over stuff like the Luminator when I\n&gt; &gt; think it is it lacking convincing evidence. But it&#39;s waaaaaay too\n&gt; &gt; early in &quot;boxology&quot; to try to make it perform as a pet circus\n&gt; animal.\n&gt; &gt; Hell, we&#39;ve been studying traditional EVP for 30 years and it still\n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t perform on cue for the scientists or anyone else. But if you\n&gt; &gt; just listen to what you get on your own and what all the others are\n&gt; &gt; getting, it becomes very clear indeed that a real phenomenon is\n&gt; &gt; occurring. Sure, some things we get that we think are paranormal may\n&gt; &gt; be just radio fragments, but one radio fragment does not negate all\n&gt; &gt; box communication. One tweaked clip is not indicative of a culture\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; researcher deceit. One &quot;I am Bazoozoo! Time to fry, foolish mortal!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; does not mean that the RS hacks are pathways to Satan&#39;s indoor\n&gt; &gt; plumbing. There are no easy answers yet--and there may never be any.\n&gt; &gt; And I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re at the stage yet where we have the right to\n&gt; &gt; demand The Truth or whether we would even see it if it was staring\n&gt; us\n&gt; &gt; in the face.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All right, enough joy in myself one-hand clapping.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; LC is right that if you want to try to pursue this in the way you\n&gt; &gt; want to pursue it, then you need to find some people who share your\n&gt; &gt; mindset and go to it. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to find those\n&gt; people\n&gt; &gt; here, necessarily--at least among the old guard.
