Did you copy and paste the entire links?  I just tried both and they worked fine.  \nBut you saw Kay&#39;s post, so now you have the right part #.  42-223\n\nhttp://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2944877&cp\n\nAnd yes, you can get them for a little less on eBay ($1.65 + 2.50 s&h).  Some are mono, \nsome are stereo.  This one from Radio Shack is stereo.  So, if you use eBay, pay attention to \nthe description, and look for two black rings on the tip of the cable (rather than one, \nwhich is mono.)\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The link is not working\n&gt; \n&gt; itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; wrote:          Hi Rees.
