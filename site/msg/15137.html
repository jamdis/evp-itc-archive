I know-I am doing it again, replying to my own reply LOL!!!

I want to brin=
g up that there was one case we had WAY back that we did actually consider =
photographic orbs as evidence. The reason we were able to do this was that =
the client claimed she could see them with her eyes and then she would take=
 a picture and sure enough-she would get orbs.

These orbs looked exactly l=
ike your everyday dust orb. While we were conducting the investigation, we =
had her tell us where to take a photo and we would take a picture. Sure eno=
ugh WITHOUT fail, we would get orbs right where she pointed them out to us.=
 We could not se them with our eyes, but she could.

Now in our other photo=
s -nothing. We didn't get any orbs at all until she was around.

At the tim=
e, we had 3 investigators using 3 different types of cameras - a film camer=
a, a low end digital and a high end digital. All 3 were picking up these or=
bs on queue.

We had no choice but to consider these orbs as something othe=
r than dust.

Still though, we could not say they were ghosts. All we could=
 say is that we couldn't explain them.

  I =
agree that this can be the case-that alot of times people create what they =
believe or want to be true when it comes to the paranormal. However it isn'=

  As far as helping stuck souls cross over using the bo=

    This crap I hear about people supposedly crossing over stuck soul=
s with a box? 

    Does not anyone get the concept that you create what yo=
u expect in the paranormal? If you think there's hauntings, you create the =
evidence to support that. If you think there's stuck souls you'll have no s=
hortage of ghosts screaming for your superhuman help. Of course, you also c=
reate the illusion of being the big expert as well-which is what I think ma=
ny want most.

    Just a suggestion--but grow up people!
