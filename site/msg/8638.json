You can see it\n&gt; in my pictures and hear it in my audio files.  Both are under Dead\n&gt; Science.\n&gt; I have to say this thing is very neat!  It really does take EMF and\n&gt; produce words.

If you need any\n&gt; information on the box please feel free to email me or just wait for\n&gt; my next Podcast at www.deadscience.com and I will talk all about it.\n&gt; Rob.\n&gt;"}
