I didn&#39;t \nmean to offend you in any way, you do a great job at developing the \nequipment.  I just thought this yahoo board was about telling each \nother what we hear in the posted files.  Now that i see how sensitive \nyou are, i will no longer comment on your files.  \n\nSorry,\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Frank, The files i heard clearly was the &quot;Frank, i&#39;m \ntalking&quot;and &quot;Thank you, princess&quot;. The other i heard &quot;He&#39;s&quot; and &quot;The \nVoltage&quot;, but didn&#39;t catch the &quot;Checking&quot; part. All in all, sounds \nlike a &quot;Frank&#39;s Box&quot; to me. Although boxes automate the raw \nmaterial....&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  That&#39;s what I&#39;ve said since day one--they use what we use, and the \nbox is not the only method, but maybe I can be pardoned, I forgot \nSteve is one of the 30, so in a unique postion to interpret, hear the \nvoices, and tell us all what they really say! Interesting that there \nis always someone that has no technical knowledge whatsoever, and \nminimal expereince, but will proceed to tell the world how this stuff \nreally works. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; More immediate than e-mail?
