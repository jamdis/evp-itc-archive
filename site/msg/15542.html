Frank makes a great point regarding EVPmaker, in that it is a perfectly goo=
d source of random noise.
=A0
To reiterate, it is the user and the method t=
hat really makes this work. The box is just one way of getting the noise.

=A0
EVPmaker may be a better way to achieve consistency since it is widely =
available.
=A0
I'm not suggesting abandoning the box technology. There may =
be reasons that higher quality sound may be 
achieved using the various box=
 variants.
=A0
But to have common ground for comparison and expectation set=
ting, using a common tool like EVPmaker 
would be sensible. It is certainly=
 easier for novices to get started with, especially those with little or no=
 
electronics experience and no access to someone to assist them in buildin=
g a box.
