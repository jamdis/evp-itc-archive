I was interviewed by \nScott and Doug for about an hour yesterday on Ghostly Talk ( \nhttp://www.ghostlytalk.com ). The topic? New research I&#39;ve done on \nthe infamous &quot;Spiricom Mark IV&quot;.\n\nIf you&#39;re familiar with the story - basically I believe I&#39;ve helped \ndispel the goofy thought that Dr. George JEFFRIES Mueller did NOT \nwork for NASA (people have confused him with Dr. George EDWIN \nMueller who DID work for NASA and is considered the &quot;father of \nSkylab&quot;, etc.). Plus I was able to disseminate 2 previously unknown \naudio recordings (by Dr. David Rivers and the late author Harold \nSherman) which showed inconsistencies in the Spiricom recordings and \nhow O&#39;Neil &quot;could&quot; have used an artificial larynx to fake the \nconversations. On the other hand - I tracked down a lot of \ndocumentation which definitely shows that Dr. George J. Mueller was \na real person and nearly everything written about him (in the \nSpiricom manual, &quot;The Ghost of 29 Megacycles&quot;) is verifiable so...\n\nThe big questions are: \n\n1. If this was a hoax - how DID Bill O&#39;Neil get so much detailed \ninformation on Mueller (he actually claimed that Mueller told him \nall this via clairaudience)? Was he really an extremely good psychic?\n\n2. If the Spiricom Mark IV really DID work, why were other users \n(such as Sarah Estep from the AAEVP) unable to get it operate?\n\nI still have more things to look into so maybe some more answers \nwill be forthcoming (or muddy the waters even more). And I want to \nthank member Jaime (i.e. xtal32768@...) for finding the \nCornell Alumni News with photo of Mueller at Picatinny Arsenal.\n\nGuy"}
