<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I just joined this group and would like to first say, &quot;hello.&quot;

Alright, so nobody hate me due to my first question, but I have to 
ask this: Is there any interest in producing these components 
overseas?  

It could be done without explanation to the manufacturers, as to what 
is being produced, and different parts could be created from 
different manufacturers, etc. I propose this, as it seems most 
electronics work is being done in China and I have a friend who 
sources/produces/imports products from there.  Just an idea...

&gt; Yeah, I&#x27;m working to get more made, but it&#x27;s a slow process, and 
there&#x27;s times when I get complterly burned out on this stuff. The 
printed circuit boards will help, now I need to find a premade 
cabinet, at a reasoanble price. It&#x27;s not like I can just mass produce 
this this stuff.

&gt; hi Everyone,Don&#x27;t everybody hate me at one time, but Frank Sumption 
was generous enough to give me his Frank&#x27;s box #12 and I immediately 
started getting results the moment I turned it on. Here are some 
results from my first session with the box on FM linear.Bruce
