I wanted to show that direct mode, or as \nthe Mini box works seems to result in clearer voices, even if it&#39;s \nnot amplified. \n\n\n Frank-S\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Marlboro63@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Heard get rigel extremely clear but the second was really hard.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Jeff\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; In a message dated 2/8/2008 3:36:43 P.M.

I have \nveryu  few of \n&gt; these, and out of four I had in the junk box, only two work. These \nare  weak, \n&gt; almost like regular EVP. Rigel is one that comes through every once \nin  \n&gt; awhile, not sure if that his name, or home, as sometimes he \nsays &quot;this is your  \n&gt; friend from Rigel&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s still looking like the sound  chamber is completely un needed, \nand may \n&gt; even hamper the voices. What I get  form the Ghostman, and even \ndirectly from a \n&gt; tuenr module is easier to  understand that the ones through an \nsound chamber \n&gt; and mic amplifiers. the  Gostman in direct mode yields longs, and \nmore \n&gt; coherent voices than the  original box, at least compared to what I \nwas getting last \n&gt; night.\n&gt; Tonight  I&#39;ll modifiy #32 to get either direct recordings out of  \nthe tuner, \n&gt; or through the sound chamber so I can compare.  I had one from \n2/5/08 from the \n&gt; Ghostman that said &quot;that Earthquake will  occur-------I had one \nfrom 2/5 \n&gt; Chile (Falklands?)C  There  was a EQ today off Brazil, but no \nisland there.\n&gt; \n&gt; DRV=direct  radio voice\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; ____________________________________\n&gt; Connect and share in new ways with Windows Live. _Get it now!_ \n&gt; (http://www.windowslive.com/share.html?\nocid=TXT_TAGHM_Wave2_sharelife_012008)   \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **************Biggest Grammy Award surprises of all time on AOL \nMusic.     \n&gt; (http://music.aol.com/grammys/pictures/never-won-a-grammy?\nNCID=aolcmp003000000025\n&gt; 48)\n&gt;"}
