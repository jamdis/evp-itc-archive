This is the &quot;eveidence&quot; I usaully don&#39;t get to see \nand hear. All I usually hear is someone saying how every other \nresearcher in the world gets nothing, he is the only one that gets \nthe valid communucation, which personally I find highly insulting. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  One fact is, I did not make a &quot;telephone to dead&quot;, I don&#39;t know \nwhat the f--- that is, and I don&#39;t endorse it! Nor do I appreciate my \nname being connected to the so called &quot;Telephone to dead&quot; on every \nfriggin&#39; ad for Moon&#39;s public appearances. I just make the boxes, I&#39;m \nnot someone&#39;s lacky. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: babiarz3@...: Mon, 3 Dec 2007 18:27:02 \n+0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Maybe there is only one box user allowed!?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for this post. it was an amazing life altering \nexperiencefor all. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, lisby@ wrote:&gt;&gt; \nFrank--I have listened to this APSR broadcast and was \nincrediblyimpressed with what occurred at this event. Chris&#39;s box is \nquitecapable of behaving like John Edward--directly bringing \nrelationsthrough to talk to those who need to hear them. Some of the \nresponseswere astoundingly clear and loud. It certainly sounded \nsimilar to whatI have heard of what Bruce is getting, and honestly, \nit is exactlywhat I hope to get with my box when I receive it.&gt; &gt; If \nyou haven&#39;t listened to this, you really should. I think Chrismade \nhis usual statements about Edison and the 30, but aside fromthat, \nthis was a wonderful session and people were extremely moved.&gt; &gt; If \nyou want, I&#39;ll find the URL.&gt; &gt; Ann&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt;From: Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@&gt;&gt; &gt;Sent: Dec 3, 2007 12:40 PM&gt; \n&gt;To: Group &lt;evp-itc@yahoogroups.com&gt;&gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Maybe there \nis only one box user allowed!?&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Christopher was immediately \ntaken by what he had seen and heard.He was able to &gt; make a direct \nconnection with spirits. inhabitants,victims, participants, and &gt; \nwitnesses...describing amazing events andeven some unspeakable acts \nthat had &gt; happened within the walls ofthese notoriously haunted \nplaces. The details &gt; afforded by thesespirits gave answers to \nlingering questions that could not &gt; have comefrom anyone but the \nparties involved. Already amazed by the &gt;instrument&#39;s ability to \nconnect with these historical figures,Christopher soon &gt; realized \nthat other entities were trying to reachout as well. Deceased \nfathers, &gt; sons, mothers, daughters, and friendsof session \nparticipants were sending &gt; messages through the device.Talk of this \nspread, and last year, at the Ghost &gt; Chaser&#39;s WeekendConference in \nSavannah, Georgia, Christopher was asked to do a &gt;presentation about \nhis research with the Telephone to the Dead. Thisquickly &gt; turned \ninto an impromtu public demonstration, withparticipants, one by one, \n&gt; coming forward requesting to speak withloved ones who had died. \nSurprisingly, &gt; even to Christopher, theserequests were met with \ncomforting and sometimes vital &gt; messages. Thepresentation was \nrecorded and broadcasted by A.P.S.R. Radio.&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From a recent add \nfor another presentation, but apparently therest of us get nothing \nlike this, so it doesn&#39;t even work for us.Guess I&#39;ll just go back to \nkilling time wth Ham radio, and quitwasting all my time and money on \nuseless boxes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Curious that no one else gets any &quot;real&quot; \ncontacts--event the socalled box inventor gets nothing.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \nFrank-S &gt; \n&gt;__________________________________________________________&gt; &gt;You \nkeep typing, we keep giving.
