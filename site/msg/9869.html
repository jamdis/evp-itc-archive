Great test Aaron.  It would seem that Stefan's idea of having SJ train your Natually Speaking software would be a logical next step.   The concept is awesome.  Ron L

I think the best results would be achieved if the speech recognition
software is trained by actual SpeakJet-synthesized speech (rather than
trying to imitate the robotic, monotonous SJ sound). In the SJ
manual http://www.speechchips.com/downloads/speakjetusermanual.pdf there
is a table of all allophones with pronunciation examples.

The 'Play List' of Audition/Cool Edit could be used to create sequences
of cues/allophones, to synthesize the words/sentences for the training.

I've uploaded some files to my folder
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Stefan/Speech%20Recognition%20Training/
to show the process. Of course, it would be a rather laborious procedure
to synthesize all the sentences necessary for the training, but, well,
that's the way science is! ;-)

My example of the synthesized sentence "Hello, good morning" might not
be the correct pronunciation, but I'm sure you as native English
speakers can do it much better than me. :)

(BTW, many EVP examples sound much more clear and fluent than my above
example...)

Stefan
