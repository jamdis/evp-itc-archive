Joel,
 
I don't think anyone would wait 30 seconds after a question and 
a=
ssociate a word or phrase to be the answer to that question.
 
Also in a th=
irty second period if the researcher has not asked another question and mov=
ed on
someone should try and help them with how they are doing a session.
 =

You Know I clip all the useless fragment crap out of my files, are you try=
ing to say you hold your research to a higher
degree than I do?
 
And becau=
se the crap sounds are cut from a file does not make it pieced together.
If=
 a researcher is taking words from different parts of a recording and putti=
ng them together to make a sentence
that would be piecing them together, th=
at would be an out and out fake.
 
As long as the researcher has the origin=
al clip to present upon request by a reputable source, that should prevent
=
questions of the files validity.

Hi all=
,just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I wouldsugg=
est not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, inorder to r=
ule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can forinstance increas=
e the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (includingthe experimenter' s vo=
ice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, butnot cut out individual pi=
eces (supposed "garbage") to make an EVP matchwith what it "should be". At =
least, the unedited version should alwaysbe provided along with the edited =
version.But that's only my personal opinion which I thought I had to expres=
s, aswe should always be able to present our results to a critical public.S=
