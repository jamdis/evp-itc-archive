Snow, 
Thanks for posting this link. I never really thou=
ght about  using an EMF 
meter during GBC, but I am going to try it. I have=
 a MEL meter  that will also 
generate an EMF field, and I'm going to try t=
hat as well and  see if the 
communication gets any better. Hopefully this =
will work great at  the Myrtles! 
Anyone else out there ever measured EMF f=
ields during GBC, or  generated 
any type of extra energy source during GBC=
?
