&gt; I am going to conduct a little experiment, if you all don&#x27;t mind.
&gt; I will give these instructions to several people.ï¿½ I encourage those here
&gt; to try it too.
&gt;
&gt; Listen to the 3rd video on that page.

&gt;
&gt; Listen especially from 4:00 to 4:10
&gt; But do not go past 4:10, because then he says what he thinks it is saying.
&gt;
&gt; Tell me what you think, if anything, the words in 4:00-4:10 are saying,
&gt; before you have gone past 4:10 and heard what the person on the audio then
&gt; says he thinks he hears.

&gt; Thanks for posting.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I am going through them now.
&gt;
&gt; Could you explain more what you meant when you said you ran the audio file
&gt; through an algorithm that adds vocal-chord- like sounds?ï¿½ To what
&gt; software/function do you refer that adds those?

&gt; Greetings fellow researchers,
&gt;
&gt; In my continuing quest to openly share what I do, I&#x27;ve completed
&gt; uploading 36 files from the numerous ITC sessions I performed durng my
&gt; plane crash paranormal investigation. (Raw files and processed files)
&gt; If you&#x27;re interested in hearing or experimenting with any of the files,
&gt; please be my guest. They are located at the following link, at the top
&gt; of the page:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.ufogeek. com/vftse. htm
&gt;
&gt; Also on that page are the videos of what I did. The Youtube multiple
&gt; segments are listed in order, first... and the entire 43 minute video
&gt; is at the bottom.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks... and have a great day!
