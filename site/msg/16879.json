I&#39;m 1/2 Cherokee and have a PhD in Ethnic Studies\n&gt; with a specialization in Native American Studies. I know many Maya people\n&gt; and have studied their mythology and culture. I hate to break anyone&#39;s\n&gt; doomsday bubbles, but the Mayan calendar did not end with the date Dec. 21,\n&gt; 2012. That was the end date on one stellae. There are many others that go\n&gt; beyond that date, including one that goes well into the 4000s. Plus, there\n&gt; are many contemporary Maya daykeepers who continue working on the calendar.\n&gt; So, to those using the Mayan calendar as a prophetic compass, I really\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t worry about the world coming to an end in 2012. Please don&#39;t take\n&gt; this post as pompous snottiness on my part. I see a lot of fear out there\n&gt; about 2012 and I&#39;m just trying to alleviate that.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pat\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Frank Sumption\n&gt; &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was watching the video on YouTube, and at 22 seconds &quot;all is doomed&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s what I get too, and have gotten it since box day one. 2.8 years to\n&gt; &gt; go!
