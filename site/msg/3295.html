 In recording using my boxes, the manual method, direct radio, and now my =
"ghostman" box, it's conclusive (tonight only) that spirits make their voic=
es mostly from audio from the speakers. With my--classic-- boxes, I can use=
 the line out to the record because the enitities are using the the sound f=
rom the sound chamber speaker. While some seem capable of manipulating the =
audio in the electronics, I get more if I use the built in mic on the tape =
deck to record from the Ghostman. As with all of this stuff, there's except=
ions, like when using the manual tune method on a radio with built in casse=
tte deck, that worked ok too, so it gets confusing. 
 
 I started to write =
this as a guide kind of for recoriding, wiht eh scan radios, but it seems t=
o remain cut a try--it depends on wht you're using, what level is coming th=
rogh and what the conditions are. Soooo--just a thought. I think the rules =
of the paranormal are written in silly putty!
