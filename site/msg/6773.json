Funny thing is, I recogni=\r\nze Mike and Lisa on your recordings too.  I&#39;m aware that they are acting as=\r\n facilitators and guardians, that they are consistent in their ability to u=\r\nse varied modes of communication, and that their contact appears to be purp=\r\noseful, as compared to so much that seems to have no rhyme or reason.  \n\nAs=\r\n a newbie I&#39;m admittedly intimidated by and in awe of the results you more =\r\nexperienced researchers are accomplishing.  What I find most awesome is tha=\r\nt everyone can have different methods, belief systems and opinions and come=\r\n together in one forum to share and learn from one another.  I feel so luck=\r\ny to have found you!  Bruce, your ability to hear and accurately repeat my =\r\none posted EVP is the only validation I&#39;ve personally ever received that ma=\r\nkes me know I&#39;m involved in something real and life altering.  I&#39;m supposed=\r\n to be here!  I think a big part of my education will continue to come from=\r\n the knowledge and experience you all are willing to keep sharing.  It&#39;s al=\r\nso a fact that each of us needs to find his/her own individual truth.  \n\nI&#39;=\r\nm still troubled by the possibility that we could be pawns in Someone Else&#39;=\r\ns science experiment.  I can sense Frank&#39;s cynicism related to the messages=\r\n being meaningless and the messengers being untrustworthy.  In your own cas=\r\ne, what is the goal?  Is the fact that you&#39;ve established communication and=\r\n continue to communicate enough?  Are we hoping to gain invaluable informat=\r\nion from our guides, or just to have the comfort of knowing they are there?=\r\n  \n\nThis is the week I&#39;ve promised myself to start doing sessions with the =\r\nRadio Shack hacks!  \n\nRobin\n\n\n\n\n\nhoogroups.com&lt;mailto:myself.@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&gt; \n  Sent: Sunday, February 03, 2008 6:25 AM\n  Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] Re:=\r\n File from tonight\n\n\n  Robin,\n   \n  I agree with Steve on a couple of point=\r\ns.
