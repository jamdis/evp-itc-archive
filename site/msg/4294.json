Tonight, i spoke to several\n&gt; different people in their own voices and really have to give credit to\n&gt; Mike and Lisa for making this communication keep getting better. This\n&gt; really is another valuable box in my research, as long as different\n&gt; designs become available i will test them all. Every box is unique\n&gt; and offers different results, but they all work off the same premise\n&gt; of raw audio bits. Real time communication is finally here and gets\n&gt; better every day, some day&#39;s frank&#39;s box is better and than some day&#39;s\n&gt; RS box...etc. Depends on your surroundings, your mood, the weather\n&gt; but all these devices have worked for me up to this point and i&#39;m\n&gt; grateful.\n&gt;\n&gt; p.s.--here is the link to the speaker so you can get a visual.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.radioshack.com/search/index.jsp?kwCatId=&kw=21-\n&gt; 549&origkw=21-549&sr=1\n&gt;\n&gt; Your going to love this wild ride and watching new people get involved\n&gt; and posted results makes it all worth it for me.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I just got my notice.
