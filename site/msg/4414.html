<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ron,

Oh no.... I&#x27;m sorry that happened.  When you closed the case did you 
possibly crimp either battery wire?  I did this once, but luckily it 
didn&#x27;t break it.  If you&#x27;re not even getting the light to come on it 
might be a power thing (battery wire broke).  Also make sure the 
connector is not offset or another pin got moved over just enough so 
as not to go into the connctor properly.  Unfortunitly, it could be a 
number of things.  I hope you are able to solve the mystery.

&gt; So dummy here couldn&#x27;t even follow Mike&#x27;s great video instructions 
with the RS12-469.  After driving two hours to Merida, Mexico and 
then back and putting down 600 pesos (about $55 dollars) it took me 
ten minutes to do everything UFO Geek laid out in his video for 
hacking the radio shack box.  Cut the right pin labeled mute.  Closed 
the box nicely.  Nothing.  Reopened the box...looked around...two 
times more...still nothing.   Not even a light or hum.  
&gt;    
&gt;   Until I figure the radio thing out, I am in the mean time getting 
nowhere (it seems) with the EVP Maker on my computer to generate EVP 
noise and using my hand recorder etc.   Wish I could try the radio 
sistem...any real geeks who can give technical suggestions would be 
greatly appreciated.  Or maybe I should just throw away my 469 and 
start over.   Dont think RS will take it back.     geek-wanna-be, Ron
