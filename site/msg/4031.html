LOL well ya remember the last time Frank...its a mad dash...a few ooo's and ahhh's....then everyone settles down and starts to work together (HOPEFULLY!!!!) and new ideas are born.
   
  hehehe it just makes ya nervous when theres 1000 emails in the inbox and you cant answer everyone. But yeah flip it off again if ya need the break. Dont get overwhelmed. Plenty of other guys here who can answer peoples questions or try to help them find the answer on thier own.
   
  I try...but there is just not enough free time in my day to reply to all of my email/posts etcetera. I do alot of speedreading and listen to alot of files at once to catch up but that usually takes up the free minutes and then its off to work/bed
   
  So just do what ya can, and if you start overdoing it, flip that sucker off for a week LOL
