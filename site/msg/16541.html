The fact that the operator CAN and DOES make recordings and files of
understandable words and phrases shows that we are dealing with an
OBJECTIVE rather than a subjective phenomenon here. Two things appear
to be going on though. <br>
First there is an actual voice modulated signal. Different people who
listen to it often hear the same thing. The sound is not perfect and is
very noisy, so that would explain others who cannot hear the message.<br>
The second thing is that some people can listen to the noise as a
"random field", and with a slightly altered state of mind, this field
will induce latent "mediumship" ability in the operator and he or she
will get a lot more information and voice material than another
listener.<br>
            <br>
Note that the content random fields have little or nothing in common
with whatever imagery or sounds may be percieved from them. They simply
enhance the user to access psychic information that, while even not
being a "psychic" allows him to get info normally innaccessable to
him/her.<br>
If there is any objective percieved sound similar to what is heard by
others impressed upon the background noise, it might be due to the
spirit who is speaking being PRESENT. That entity would then be able to
get the message through to the operator Psychicly on another level.
that the words are also in the noise would be a co-incidence.<br>
            <br>
I work with VISUAL random fields---The imagery, while clear, is formed
in my mind/eye system , so I cannot photograph it. Some of this EVP
background noise may be working the same way too---formed in the
Mind/EAR system. This is only heard by the primary operator and likely
cannot be recorded to a file. <br>
But some random field stuff IS objective--for example, using a random
backdrop for ghost photos makes the ghosts easier to, and more often
appear in a photo. This is equavalent to the EVP that people can hear
on the recorded file.<br>
            <br>
I will discuss and explain random field theory itself, later, in its
own posting. <br>
