It can and does tell people what they want to hear, and it s=\r\neems to be reading the minds of the participants.

One of the more interesting responses I&#39;ve =\r\ngotten out of the box is that it has said &quot;ovulous&quot; backwards (it said &quot;75&quot;=\r\n forwards), and that was just 10 minutes or so after I was playing around w=\r\nith the Ovilus.
