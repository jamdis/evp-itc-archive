 Just the stuff I got Saturday. The Sony radio is usable on AM only, and t=
his Honda radio is the one I was talking about last night needed the 'code'=
. With these modules, there is an external resistor/capacitor network that =
is mounted on the main board that has to do with he FM IF output, and the M=
PX(stereo multiplex) circuit. I failed to note this on the same radio I had=
 in 2004, so there was a couple problems with getting the modules to work b=
efore. 
 
 The trick to using the car tuner is to power up the radio, then =
measure all voltages on the module's pins to locate all signals needed for =
operation, like power, and the tuning voltage, and any enable voltages, gro=
unds, and audio output. Also noting all resistors, and capacitor connected =
to the pins. It helps to have scope. I use these tuner because they are com=
pact, senstive, and voltage tunable.
