I got audacity working and processed my 1/19/10 session with my &quot;Tom&#39;s\nTube&quot; ghostbox\n\nI was quite impressed, if I say so myself. Cant vouch for their authenticity\nthough, as I could not hear the questions and the requests I asked. The voices\nsound quite plain and do not seem to be a snatch of radio sound--as I can hear\nthe scans in the background.\n\nOne seems to say &quot;Its Oh for naught&quot; and someething else at the end of it. The\nother file seems to say &quot;get down&quot; in a fast faint voice near the beginning,\nfollowed by a louder &quot;he was like 40&quot;\n\nIm gonna have to put an external mike on the other recorder channel so I can\nhear what I am saying and get some context to better interpret the validity of\nthe message (radio or paranormal)\n\nThat 25 inch long , 2 inch pipe that I use for a resonator seems to be very\neffective."}
