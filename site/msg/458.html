<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, those nasty, name calling e-mails continued in private for a 
couple days. I can only guess what Grass Harp has degenerated into 
now. Even Wisteria sent her two cents worth, then blocked my e-mail 
so I couldn&#x27;t reply. Oh well, stupid is as stupid does!

 Ya can&#x27;t keep it friendly, so everyone can share results, and 
methods, there&#x27;s always some whacko that wants to be the world&#x27;s 
only expert, and no on else is allowed to do any work, or post any 
results that may make the &quot;Expert&quot; look bad, especially when the  
whacko &quot;Expert&quot; gets no contacts at all! 

 All of this being said for the benefit of any other Grass Harp 
members that may be lurking here. You&#x27;ll notice, membership is still 
not screened, and posts not filtered. Anytime someone thinks the 
Princess is some weak minded fool, and can be attacked easily, all I 
can say is bring it! 

 BTW, what&#x27;s stops anyone from joining multiple groups, and lists? 
I&#x27;m on a few others myself, like Unknown Country,  Darkness  On Edge 
Radio, Lightworker-Psychic-ET Hangout, and Millennium-Predictions.

 What small little minds these people have that would attack others!
