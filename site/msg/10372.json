All good \nideas. \n\nI already started my transition and have moved many things over as \nwell as deleted. I am considering making a group account that only \ngroup members can upload to (esnips allows that type of file sharing \nbetween friends) I just havent had the time or focus to put into \nsetting it up (thats alot of emails to type in to add as friends \nLOL). Plus they are in middle of massive changes/updates so waiting \nfor the dust to settle. I also considered getting a private server \nsharing system set up so people could upload thier stuff but seems \ncomplicated for most who arent used to using ftp.\n\nKeep sharing ideas tho because eventually maybe we will make it \nbetter for everyone.\n\nI rather not set limits on sizes but when ya hit 96% full somethings \ngotta go LOL so we start small and work our way to the resolution.
