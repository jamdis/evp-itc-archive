The echo box seems to be almost the number \none factor in how clear the voices are. All of these tonight have been with \none of the small wave guide type boxes. Sizes shown on the diagram are only \napproximate, I tend to make them in &quot;what feels right&quot; sizes. They can be \nmade out of wood, metal, or plastic, maybe card board(?), same as the \nchannel seperators. It does need to be air tight! In the one I used tonight \nthe top and bottom were 1/16th thick aluminum, and the sides, ends, and \nseprators 1/8 inch lexan, (plexiglass). The speaker is from a modem, about \none inch in diameter, and the mic a 3/8th diameter electret.\n\nFrank-S\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nhttp://liveearth.msn.com\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_6468_3e17_62b2\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;6-FrankIsABitch.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;6-FrankIsABitch.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_6468_3e17_62b2\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;MicroEchobox.JPG&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;MicroEchobox.JPG&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_6468_3e17_62b2--"}
