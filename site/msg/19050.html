<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You have probably experienced this too.

When you first turn a box on, it takes a moment or two of garbled
communication for it to start working.  It is kind of like clearing
your throat in the morning.  After this, for my boxes it takes about
20 seconds, I get a clear signal that lets me know communication is
about to start.

I almost always get this voice.  He comes across loud during an audio
pause and yells the word &quot;NOW.&quot; Once I hear this, I know communication
is about to start.  I have asked repeatedly who says &quot;Now&quot; but I never
get an answer.  It is the same voice every time though.

Does anyone else experience this?

I ask this in particular because I was reading Raudive&#x27;s book again
and I noted that on page 23 (the section on radio recording) he wrote
that when trying to find an interfrequency to record on (via direct
radio voice) one &quot;listens carefully for a voice that will hiss &quot;Now,&quot;
or &quot;Make Recording,&quot; or some such hint.&quot;

I find it interesting that the same clues are left for us 40 years
after Raudive with a whole new technology (sweeping frequency radio).

If you do not experience the same &quot;now&quot; as I do, are there any other
consistent signals you receive from the other side?
