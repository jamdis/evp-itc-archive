<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi James;

I have gotten that echo wiht almost ever method, EVPmaker, and radio 
scanning methods, or my boxes,  there&#x27;s often a pre-echo, and post echo. I 
don&#x27;t know what causes it.

&gt;
&gt;Hi Everyone,
&gt;
&gt;My name is James from Arizona and have about a million questions about
&gt;EVP. I am a ghosthunter and I have had great success in recording
&gt;EVP&#x27;s recently. I have included a link to one of our recent
&gt;investigations and recorded an EVP at a restaurant that said &quot;Say
&gt;Goodbye!&quot; as an investigator and myself were walking away from the
&gt;area.This is an authentic EVP.
&gt;
&gt;It came from a cassette tape and has not been altered or filtered in
&gt;the least. I have been an active ghosthunter for about 3 years now.
&gt;Here is the link. Would like to know what you all think of it.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Question: I am noticing a strange echo reverberation when I record
&gt;loud EVP&#x27;s. When I record &quot;whisper&quot; type EVP&#x27;s I don&#x27;t get this echo.
&gt;
&gt;What do you all think casuses this strange echo quality?
&gt;
&gt;Look forward to talking to all of you!
&gt;
&gt;James
