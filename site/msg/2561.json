I can open \nExpress PCB files, although I haven&#39;t used them for any boards yet. It&#39;s \nusually far cheaper for me to make a board myself than have them do it.\n\nA lot of the stuff I&#39;ve been doing is for amateur radio microwave \nfrequencies.  I usually make the circuit pattern with a CAD program, print \nit on transparent laser printer sheets, and use DATAK photoresist and \ndeveloper to make boards.  I&#39;ve been working with 10-mil thick Rogers \nDuroid 5880 board for 24 GHz and I have some of the 5-mil stuff, which is \npaper-thin.  But I wouldn&#39;t use any of that expensive stuff for your \ncircuit. I have lots of G-10 too.\n\nI didn&#39;t know about bdent.com.  Looks like a great resource for parts. \nThanks!\n\nZack\n\nOn Sun, 21 Oct 2007, Frank Sumption wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m using the LA1816 (bdent.com), it needs only the oscillator coil, a \n&gt; 455khz ceramic filter, and  a choke I wind by hand for AM, and pretty \n&gt; much the same for FM. I add an AM RF amp so I can use a wire antenna. If \n&gt; you can work with SMT compnents, I have a layout all done. I order the \n&gt; boards from Express PCB for about $93 for two (min order), and if you \n&gt; want the silk screen on the board, that doubles the cost. There are some \n&gt; mistakes/changes to the current schematics that have been posted out on \n&gt; the net, I have up dates, but they are at work, and I can&#39;t post it from \n&gt; there, I keep forgetting to bring them home.   FM leaves something to be \n&gt; desired, but I&#39;m rearranging the two FM coils on the latest board layout \n&gt; to see if that helps.  The component values are marked for the top side \n&gt; with the silk screen, but there&#39;s no way to label the bottom from \n&gt; Express PCB. There&#39;s some jumpers needed, and I think I have them all \n&gt; labeled. You will have to down load the software from Express PCB to see \n&gt; the layout http://www.expresspcb.com/\n&gt;\n&gt; Getting the board is the easy part, assembly and wiring, that takes some time!\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;"}
