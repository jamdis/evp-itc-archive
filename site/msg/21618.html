&gt; Since the 70s, huh? I&#x27;m sorry, but I have to disagree. Well, maybe I&#x27;ve
&gt; been imagining things for the past ten years, but there have been a host
&gt; of researchers inventing real-time communication devices that produce
&gt; some pretty convincing intelligent responses, or &quot;EVP.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; No disrespect intended, but do you really think that this scientist is
&gt; an expert in EVP because he wrote a book that wasn&#x27;t even picked up by a
&gt; real publisher? That doesn&#x27;t fly with people who have been doing this
&gt; for ages and who have been producing exceptional results. A person can&#x27;t
&gt; just saunter into a field such as this with a Ph.D. and flash a book
&gt; around claiming to know it all. In my humble opinion, this isn&#x27;t a field
&gt; that can be targeted for scientific research. There are too many
&gt; variables to consider, most of which we know nothing about. It&#x27;s nearly
&gt; impossible to prove that EVP is real, scientifically or not, because
&gt; there are always skeptics who will claim it&#x27;s all fake. (And of course,
&gt; everyone else knows better, right?)  I&#x27;ve read several journal articles
&gt; and papers written by university professors and serious researchers, and
&gt; from what I&#x27;ve learned, you can try as many times as you want to have a
&gt; &quot;controlled&quot; environment for so-called &quot;scientific&quot; EVP research, but it
&gt; will fail, over and over. You know why? The human element will
&gt; interfere, whether it&#x27;s during the experiment or afterward, every time.
&gt; Now, I&#x27;m not saying your belief that this book is good is ridiculous
&gt; because it must have value for you, or you wouldn&#x27;t have posted it. I
&gt; would like to point out, however, that you might consider a more open
&gt; minded approach before waltzing into a group like this and insulting its
&gt; population with your particular phraseology. We are all somewhat learned
&gt; individuals, and we are particularly well-read in this field. Please do
&gt; not assume we are unaware of anything.

&gt; &gt; Thanks..you have a great web site there.!I was looking at your
&gt; &gt;
&gt; pageshttp://www.realinvestigationsoftheparanormal.net/index.php?p=1_50_H\
&gt; \
&gt; &gt; aunted-Tanning-SpaI found alot of background noise but did manage to
&gt; &gt; hear some of the evp`s.I am half way through getting operations on my
&gt; &gt; inner ear so I have a problem with some frequency ranges.What main
&gt; &gt; equipment are you using for evp work.The reason I brought up the book
&gt; &gt; was I dont think the &quot;field&quot; will advance much without a firm
&gt; &gt; scientific/empirical basis.And no one has done the blind testing that
&gt; &gt; McCrae has done..and published..I have a few books on evp now...and
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; book makes most of them look like books produced for kids..Thats the
&gt; &gt; difference..The &quot;mere&quot; collecting of more and more evp`s..has not
&gt; moved
&gt; &gt; the field anywhere since the 1970`s.And that comment is not a slight
&gt; &gt; towards people collecting evp`s.. :)But if researchers are unware what
&gt; &gt; has been accomplished in the field by scientists, or analogies to some
&gt; &gt; of the reports associated with some forms of mental illness etcthen I
&gt; &gt; think they are missing out.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] NEW BOOK ON EVP-BY A SCIENTIST
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Since the evp field has hardly evolved in the last 30 years
&gt; &gt; scientifically at
&gt; &gt; &gt; least
&gt; &gt; &gt; I decided to download this  ebook the other day.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I realise that many of you would not know of a scientist called Alex
&gt; &gt; McCrae but
&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of wandering around with a tape recorder/any device and then
&gt; &gt; postng up
&gt; &gt; &gt; examples for discussion,and thinking thats cutting edge.. he has
&gt; taken
&gt; &gt; the genre
&gt; &gt; &gt; about 20 steps past that.
&gt; &gt; &gt; From his site
&gt; &gt; &gt; He is one of the few to use faraday cages/blind tests on subject to
&gt; &gt; rule out
&gt; &gt; &gt; pareidolia/going to differernt countries and still getting evp in
&gt; his
&gt; &gt; &gt; language..finding commonlaity with evp voices and the voice that
&gt; some
&gt; &gt; people
&gt; &gt; &gt; with some  forms of mental illness &quot;hear&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Science Proves Spirits Exist!
&gt; &gt; &gt; Science Proves Spirits Exist! You already knew that?Cool&quot;
&gt; &gt; but now no one can
&gt; &gt; &gt; argue with you about it.Just point to the EVIDENCE!With the kind
&gt; &gt; permission of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Institute of Noetic Sciences [yes, the people mentioned in Dan
&gt; &gt; Brown&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; book!] retired Scottish scientist Alexander MacRae carried out a key
&gt; &gt; experiment
&gt; &gt; &gt; at their laboratory in California.Read the evidence in The Portal
&gt; &gt; &quot; Part One .
&gt; &gt; &gt; From the cricket noises no one is doing reel to reel work anymore
&gt; here
&gt; &gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sarah Estep.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fair enough..
