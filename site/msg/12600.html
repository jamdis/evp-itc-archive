<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks, W.  I really feel like someone in spirit whispered the suggestion in my ear to try 
this method.  So glad I was paying attention.  And I&#x27;m glad I was able to overcome my 
technical challenges ... having never transferred video to a computer before, nor worked 
with any video software, it was a bit of an uphill battle for me in the beginning.  LOL - it 
took me hours, not kidding, to figure out how to make and convert the video for YouTube.  
Thank goodness old dogs actually can learn new tricks.  ;-)

&gt; Your stuff is awesome Margaret. It&#x27;s not only paranormal, but art and  
&gt; so beautiful.  :) I think I will try this method this winter. What a  
&gt; good idea to pass the cold winter days... video record spirits!

&gt; &gt; I agree there is probably a mundane explanation for the face in this  
&gt; &gt; article, however, there
&gt; &gt; is no chance of that with my technique, as I&#x27;m taking video directly  
&gt; &gt; into a pot of water.
&gt; &gt; Others have been successful in replicating my simple set-up and have  
&gt; &gt; also gotten curious
&gt; &gt; results. One of my images was even confirmed by a forensic lab as  
&gt; &gt; being that of my GG-
&gt; &gt; grandfather. Here is a link to my 3-min YouTube video:

&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s so easy. I wish more people would try it! :-)
