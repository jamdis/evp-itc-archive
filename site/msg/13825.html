It's not that I don't want to test it, it is that I can't. It would be inte=
resting and I would do it if I could.

But again, this test could really on=
ly rule out psychic interference from you. It is too subjective and therefo=
re cannot stand as a measurement for other tests of this nature by itself.
=

If it failed to get your number, that would not mean that it couldn't get =
someone else's number or that someone else couldn't influence it. That woul=
d also not mean that answers it had gotten in the past weren't correct, com=
ing from a living being or a spirit.  It would not prove anything, except t=
hat it was not acting on any psychic vibrations from you personally.

If it=
 got your number correct, that doesn't even help immediately, because it co=
uld get the answer on mere chance.

The only way to prove here that it is b=
eing psychically influenced would be to run several tests of the same natur=
e. Then, if it scored correct higher then mere chance, only then could you =
say that the board can be psychically tampered with. Still, that is the onl=
y thing you could say for certain. That would not rule out the possibility =
that spirits can communicate through it.

 So we would be left with more qu=
estions. Is it that it is being psychically tampered with by a human mind d=
irectly? Is it and actual entity reading someone's mind? Can it be both?

S=
ee what I am sayin'?
