This places construction has always fascinated me as much as the construction of the pyramids. This man locked on to the secret but took his secret to the grave only leaving behind a few clues and books on his theories.
   
  I was surfing the web researching and found something interesting, it was removed from the web but it still exists in web archives and was a very interesting read for me so I thought I would share it with you guys. 
   
  Coral Castle Code: Secrets Revealed
   
  It got me thinking and I may have burned out a few brain cells wrapping my mind arond the whole idea but I am still fascinated and amazed at this little old man and his bicycle with no tires and a magnet contraption strapped to the back which he used to ride around on to locate the "spot" to build his monuments and lifting/floating tons of rock all by himself. He said he knew the secrets to the pyramids and quite frankly I believe he did.
   
  The idea that radio waves were used as a magnetic force to move tons of rock in conjunction with natural earth forces is something I hadnt run across before as well as his secret "code" he left behind.
