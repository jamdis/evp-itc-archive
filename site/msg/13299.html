Thanks for the clarifications Frank. My comments I guess were more along th=
e lines of a Social Worker believing that the parent was not capable of pro=
viding a safe environment for the child because of a perceived mental illne=
ss, the symptoms of which were insisting they were hearing voices, which th=
e Social Worker, or investigating doctor, could not. (I'm not making a comm=
ent here about the validity of ITC research: just noting what a Social Work=
er might perceive).=A0 So it's not a 'belief' in ITC, but a behavior, a rep=
orted symptom, and a perceived health issue.=A0 I'm glad you have expertise=
 in this area, so maybe you could comment more on that part?=A0 Maybe it wo=
uld be an interesting topic of discussion you could bring up to one of your=
 teachers, and let us know the result?

I think Misty ma=
kes some good points, and I agree that the issue is similar to how one expo=
ses a child to a belief system, such as a religion.=A0 I agree, too, that i=
t will depend on the individual situation, as some will do this in a health=
y way, and some may not: for example, we could all probably name some relig=
ious cults that have been more harmful than good.=A0 In the ITC world, I su=
ppose a bad situation would be one where a poor ITC researcher (one who thi=
nks they are getting results, but isn't) insists to the child that they can=
 hear spirits. And I suppose a good situation would be as Misty suggested: =
where an open mind is presented to them.=A0 

And as Frank noted, this like=
ly also depends on the child. And Frank also mentioned something I thought =
was interesting: mental health.=A0 What is normal for mental health is ofte=
n defined as what the majority believes.=A0 Since ITC is still not as big a=
 belief system
 as other religions or belief systems, it could be seen as a=
bnormal by the uninitiated.=A0 And if Social Services were to get involved =
(depending on how open minded the worker was) it could result in a messy si=
tuation for someone who was insisting they could hear voices talking to the=
m over the radio or other devices.=A0 

Or do you think this is an overreat=
ion on my part to what Frank meant there?

I think the answers will=
 vary from individual to individual based on thier beliefs. As for me perso=
nally I grew up surrounded by unexplained events and my parents tried to ig=
nore the things that they couldnt see because if you ignore it then it does=
nt exist right? But there comes a time when the child grows up and forms th=
ier own ideas and beliefs. Personally speaking once I reached adulthood the=
re were many other people who experienced the same things I did in that hou=
se so I began to see that there was more to it than just a childs imaginati=
on.

Most religions are based upon the idea that there is a higher power, t=
hat we all have spirits, and that there is something beyond this life. To s=
ay that someone is wrong for belief in ghosts I would have to say that bill=
ions of others are wrong for having belief at all. I dont think bad of a pa=
rent who takes their kids off to church every sunday nor do I think badly a=
bout a parent who spends some
 time doing ITC. Telling a child that there i=
s more than what the eye can see, more than what the ears can hear, is givi=
ng them the basics for growing up with a mind thats open to possibility. Wh=
at they do with that is up to them individually.

I worry more about the ki=
ds who grow up with parents who are alchoholics, drug addicts, liars, thiev=
es, abusers, etcetera.. than anyone. 

As for if the effect is positive or =
negative, I think that has to do with the intent or the approach taken by e=
ach individual whether it be ITC, religion, or life in general.
