So we need to talk about what you mean by that.\n\n                  W=\r\nhen you use the microphone, you just speak, and let the recorder do the res=\r\nt.  In this case, you are using the recorder without really knowing how it =\r\nworks.   If a spirit can manipulate the EMF field around the AtoD converter=\r\n (even without using the mic), then they should be able to do the same: jus=\r\nt use it without knowing how it works: the recorder does the rest.  In neit=\r\nher case do either of you need to know how it works, to get it to work. I a=\r\nm not questioning this.\n\n                  But, if they are going to change=\r\n the bits on the actual media themselves, then they must know how it works,=\r\n it order to get all those bit-things I mentioned right.  The recorder can&#39;=\r\nt &quot;do the rest&quot;, because by changing the bits on the media themselves, they=\r\n are going completely around what the recorder does, and doing the details =\r\nthemselves.  And as I said, the details there are very technical, and inclu=\r\nde things like converting their words into digital samples of groups of a s=\r\npecific number of bits in a specific format on specific places in specific =\r\norders with other specific other bits connected to them like file ownership=\r\n and dates and such.  It is the job, basically, of a computer, not a person=\r\n.\n\n                  If they are changing the bits on the media, then the r=\r\necorder is not doing that.  They are no longer letting the recorder &quot;do it&quot;=\r\n, like you or they would be if they just used it normally.  The reason you =\r\ncan &quot;make it work&quot; without understanding it, is because the recorder is doi=\r\nng the work for you.  If they are to change the media directly, then the re=\r\ncorder is no longer doing the work, and so they must understand all those d=\r\nigital issues.\n\n                  So that is the difference between being a=\r\nble to use it without understanding it, and not being able to use it.\n\n\n\n  =\r\n                --- On Wed, 5/20/09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh=\r\n ostresearch. com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                    From: April Abercrombie &lt;ap=\r\nril@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt;\n                    Subject: Re: [EVP-I=\r\nTC] Re: I have a question.\n                    To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com=\r\n\n                    Date: Wednesday, May 20, 2009, 3:11 PM\n\n\n             =\r\n       =EF=BB=BF \n\n                    My point was that they don&#39;t need to=\r\n know how it works for it to work, like my analogy of when I speak into a m=\r\nicrophone.
