VP-ITC] Re: Just the fact!




Chris was the first and only person testing =
this device for quite sometime, making him the "primary tester". The dictio=
nary defines the word"primary" as being or standing first in a list. You of=
fer that he wasalso the first to understand how it was supposed to be used.=
 Yet, nowas more and more people weigh in with their own opinions you quest=
ionyour initial judgment. The fact is that Chris' opinion of how the boxsho=
uld be used has never changed. He has held steadfast to hisbeliefs. That, m=
y friend, is an honorable trait in this field and afact that should be cons=
idered. Chris has also never claimed this technology to be his own. He hasa=
lways and will always give credit where credit is due. He does thisboth pub=
licly and privately. The use of syntax here on whether we call it Frank's B=
ox, TheTelephone to the Dead, Maxi/Mini Box, or Granola in a can is of noim=
portance. Truly, because Edison's plans were never discovered thereis no wa=
y to know for sure whether or not your plans are exactly whatEdison was wor=
king on. There also seems to be a bit of confusion on the role the"technici=
ans" play in this along with another syntax issue ( could thewords network =
and technician be used interchangeably?). Thetechnicians are not interprete=
rs. They can provide assistance to thosespirits too excited or otherwise un=
able to communicate effectively.And they, the technicians, also serve to as=
sist higher vibrations comethrough (just as your "network"). They can also =
be of benefit whenlower vibrations try to get through. You state you heard =
a voice say "Edison here" and awhile back you hadposted that you did believ=
e it to in fact be Edison himself. Yet nowyou say the "supposed" Edison con=
versation. As for portals... I've made my concerns clear previously known.H=
owever, I have witnessed the box being used in one location only tohave act=
ivity spike in another. I've also heard many other storiesrelated to dark o=
r lower entities. So, perhaps you have had noexperiences yet but, others ha=
ve and they are speaking up. You repeatedly state that Chris is a good guy =
but then you say "if hecan't use it in an honest manner..." What could be m=
ore honest thansomeone sticking to the same beliefs he's held since day one=
? Whatcould be more honorable than stating his fears and providing what hef=
eels is a needed warning? Frank, isn't it possible that you two both bring =
something separate tothis device? You, the technology and science said. Chr=
is, the mediumand spiritual side. Someone posted separately here about Chri=
s' ego. I can say this...having concern for the possible negative fall out =
to unsuspectingpeople is in no way ego ridden. To assume that you know Chri=
s'intentions is full of ego. To claim that he only wants to preventothers f=
rom having a device for selfish reasons, is ego's way oftelling you that yo=
u and everyone else "deserves" to have what we donot fully understand. Ego =
won't let you consider that because "youwant what you want when you want it=
".BTW- when the word "harmony" is referred to here it is not a "feelinginsi=
de" like self esteem or some other warm fuzzy. It is aboutresonance, vibrat=
ions, that which will be matched by like resonanceand vibrations. Harmony. =
