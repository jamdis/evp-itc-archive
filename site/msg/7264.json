Your message was communicated\nto Frank and he realizes that it wasn&#39;t the intention of A&E to\ndeliberately post inaccurate info and that PRS is separate from the\nnetwork. I believe he considers the issue to be closed.  Regards, Bill\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Regan&quot; &lt;haunt.seeker@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for bringing this to our attention. I wasn&#39;t even aware that \n&gt; this episode was airing next week. You all have to understand that A&E \n&gt; and PRS are TWO SEPARATE entities. We do everything in our power to \n&gt; maintain accuracy. This has been brought to my attention from someone \n&gt; else and I am awaiting Mr. Sumption to contact me. \n&gt; --------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Ryan Buell\n&gt; -Director/Founder of Penn State PRS\n&gt; &quot;To Trust, Honor, and Always Seek the Truth.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Questions, comments, concerns, harassments?&quot;\n&gt; Email: ryanb@...\n&gt;"}
