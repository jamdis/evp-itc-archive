<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>As most of us know, Sarah Estep, was the founder of the AA-EVP--the  
route by I, and many of us, first got to the place we&#x27;re at today.  
I&#x27;ve heard from a friend of mine who is also of that generation of  
EVP tapers, that Sarah&#x27;s condition is deteriorating. I&#x27;d like to ask  
all of you to send positive thoughts her way, as she was always a  
very gracious lady who was more than helpful to many, many people who  
were interested in taping. I bought my first equipment from Sarah&#x27;s  
husband and benefited greatly from her wisdom, always given freely.  
She will be remembered as giant in this field.

Please think of her kindly this Christmas Eve.

Ann</pre>
