What kind of crystal was it Frank?  I had an experience many years ago where I was dealing with some very strange entities, I got talking to this guy who had experience with these entities and he said either they (meaning him and someone else I think) were using piezoelectric crystals to contact these entities.  Either that or meant the entities were using them.
