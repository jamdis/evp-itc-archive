Frank R.,
 
This post is a very lucid, intelligent, well thought out and
w=

re=
spond with their gut instead of their brain 
 
 
I will concede that I agre=
e with 99.9% of it. 
your right and have humbled me.

"Hav=

 that I can get a connection at all. This unfounded jealousy is exactly wha=

al experimental pieces of equipment that have given me different degrees of=
 success in the clarity of communication. The equipment is only a small par=

 them. The social workers are the ones trying to help the earthbound spirit=

ubject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Babs has Issues!

I never said Frank was misguided or=
 selfish but, I'm not surprised youconstrued it that way.Research and resea=
rchers in the truest form of the word is and areopen to critique and sugges=
tions. So, no, in the truest meaning Idon't believe so. My comments were ab=
solutely valid and could havebeen used in a productive manner but, instead =
I was deflected andcalled names. For myself, I believe it is of utmost impo=
rtance to have an accurateview of what is really happening. Edited files ma=
y indeed be veryaccurate but there is no way to tell when the raw is not av=
ailable andit causes me great concern that the suggestion was met with such=
hostility. If it doesn't cause each of you concern as well, then Iworry abo=
ut your ability to be objective as well. Have none of younever wondered why=
 some files here are amazingly clear while othersare far closer to what act=
ually happens with any of the devices? Hasno one else questioned this, even=
 to yourself? I get approximately 2-3 emails a week from people wondering t=
hat. You can not become offended and take questions like mine personally. I=
was never attacking. I asked for opinions and thoughts about myquestions. D=
o you accept everything you see and hear from everyone at face value?Do you=
 never have ideas on how things might be improved? Do you neverquestion? I'=
m guessing the answer to all three is a "no". I never said anyone was fakin=
g anything here. If you thought that thanI wonder why you thought that. Per=
sonally, I believe thatcommunication is happening. It is the how and the wh=
y and the ways itcan be possibly improved that concern me. It is in knowing=
 what isbeing recorded accurately, before it is cut and spliced and ampedot=
herwise it is not a true representation of what is happening. Wealmost comp=
letely eliminate the truth in peer review when we onlyprovide them with an =
end result not how we got there. There is nothing negative in what I posted=
, only in the reaction. Ihave seen Bruce come under fire before but it's th=
ese comments andopinions and suggestions of mine that cause him so much neg=
ativity hewants to leave? So, in the end I have a clearer idea. The group i=
s concerned solelywith recording and developing devices to do so. That's fi=
ne. Recordingthe communications is a good thing. But my opinions thoughts, =
etc arenot welcome here or desired. That's fine too. I wish you all the bes=

<DIV id=3DEC_y=
grp-text>
<P>I never said Frank was misguided or selfish but, I'm not surpr=
ised you<BR>construed it that way.<BR>Research and researchers in the trues=
t form of the word is and are<BR>open to critique and suggestions. So, no, =
in the truest meaning I<BR>don't believe so. My comments were absolutely va=
lid and could have<BR>been used in a productive manner but, instead I was d=
eflected and<BR>called names. <BR>For myself, I believe it is of utmost imp=
ortance to have an accurate<BR>view of what is really happening. Edited fil=
es may indeed be very<BR>accurate but there is no way to tell when the raw =
is not available and<BR>it causes me great concern that the suggestion was =
met with such<BR>hostility. If it doesn't cause each of you concern as well=
, then I<BR>worry about your ability to be objective as well. Have none of =
you<BR>never wondered why some files here are amazingly clear while others<=
BR>are far closer to what actually happens with any of the devices? Has<BR>=
no one else questioned this, even to yourself? I get approximately 2<BR>-3 =
emails a week from people wondering that. <BR>You can not become offended a=
nd take questions like mine personally. I<BR>was never attacking. I asked f=
or opinions and thoughts about my<BR>questions. <BR>Do you accept everythin=
g you see and hear from everyone at face value?<BR>Do you never have ideas =
on how things might be improved? Do you never<BR>question? I'm guessing the=
 answer to all three is a "no". <BR>I never said anyone was faking anything=
 here. If you thought that than<BR>I wonder why you thought that. Personall=
y, I believe that<BR>communication is happening. It is the how and the why =
and the ways it<BR>can be possibly improved that concern me. It is in knowi=
ng what is<BR>being recorded accurately, before it is cut and spliced and a=
mped<BR>otherwise it is not a true representation of what is happening. We<=
BR>almost completely eliminate the truth in peer review when we only<BR>pro=
vide them with an end result not how we got there. <BR>There is nothing neg=
ative in what I posted, only in the reaction. I<BR>have seen Bruce come und=
er fire before but it's these comments and<BR>opinions and suggestions of m=
ine that cause him so much negativity he<BR>wants to leave? <BR>So, in the =
end I have a clearer idea. The group is concerned solely<BR>with recording =
and developing devices to do so. That's fine. Recording<BR>the communicatio=
ns is a good thing. But my opinions thoughts, etc are<BR>not welcome here o=
r desired. That's fine too. <BR>I wish you all the best in your en devours.=
