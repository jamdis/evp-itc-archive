I pray \nfor \n&gt; the safe return of her, but if that is not possible I hope for a \n&gt; recovery so there is closure.\n&gt; I also hope someone in our group is able to help locate an area to \n&gt; search.  I&#39;m sure there are some in the group who are already \nworking \n&gt; on your request.\n&gt; We have many here who have been very successful at contacting those \n&gt; who may be able to help, using the numerous devices available.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sure those involved will contact you if an answer is found.\n&gt; Again, I pray for things to work out, you are in all our prayers.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike Coletta\n&gt; UFOMagazine.net\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mamahaugs&quot; &lt;mamahaugs@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi I am newer to this sight I enjoy reading all your messages.
