For \ninstance, I know I&#39;m not the only one that has ideas come to them \nwhile taking a shower. Sunday afternoon, while so occupied, a notion \ncame strongly over me, which is just the awaited nudge I was waiting \nfor before buying a MiniBox myself. I had an almost electrical \nfeeling to utilize a MiniBox at a shamanic studies class my shaman \nteacher begun, and I facilitate now. You see he past away back in \nApril and it&#39;s my impression he wishes for that group to try \ncommunicating with him! I&#39;ve got both eyes and ears open.

I played it back as I was still &gt; driving. During one \npart, I told them about the box and what I wanted &gt; them to do once I \nhad it.

You say you don&#39;t know \nChris&gt; &gt; &gt; personally but that it seems I am the one wearing rose \ncolored&gt; &gt; &gt; glasses. I do know Chris. Even when Frank is upset he \nsays &quot;Chris&gt; &gt; is a&gt; &gt; &gt; nice guy&quot;. Chris&#39; statements and beliefs \nhave never changed while&gt; &gt; &gt; others can be wishy washy depending on \nthe day. The view that Chris&gt; &gt; &gt; does not want any one to research \nthe box besides him is BS. The&gt; &gt; fact&gt; &gt; &gt; is that prior to Franks \noriginal yahoo group disappearing, Chris&gt; &gt; &gt; provided a link \ndirectly to the schematics. In his presentations he&gt; &gt; &gt; would tell \npeople that the schematics were available online. Yet,&gt; &gt; &gt; because \nhe is against mass production, it MUST be because he wants&gt; &gt; the&gt; &gt; \n&gt; research all to himself. Rose colored glasses or a case of only&gt; &gt; \nseeing&gt; &gt; &gt; what is wanted? This is a fact compared to perceptions \nand&gt; &gt; opinions.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Almost each and every user of a box \nor it&#39;s facsimile have&gt; &gt; &gt; stated that lower energy/evil/dark... \nentities have spoken via the&gt; &gt; &gt; device.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Rick Moran \nstates that the groups for testing will include&gt; &gt; &gt; believers, \nskeptics, senior citizens, (now here&#39;s where it gets&gt; &gt; scary)&gt; &gt; &gt; \nCHILDREN and HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS!&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; - Couple the last two \nfacts together and do the math. One mentally&gt; &gt; &gt; unstable child or \nyouth hears the box tell him it is right to kill&gt; &gt; or&gt; &gt; &gt; rape \nor .....&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Rick Moran in his article about Tools being \nonly as good as&gt; &gt; the&gt; &gt; &gt; users states, &quot;...know how they work \nbefore you go into the field.&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; So, in one place we are still \ntesting, in another we are sending&gt; &gt; them&gt; &gt; &gt; out in the field to \nbe tested by groups that include children and&gt; &gt; high&gt; &gt; &gt; school \nstudents. The good thing is that a nice little online&gt; &gt; tutorial&gt; &gt; \n&gt; is available with some warnings. Phew! As long as this can&#39;t come&gt; \n&gt; back&gt; &gt; &gt; on anyone I guess all the bases are covered (tongue in \ncheek).&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Chris has been the primary tester of the \ndevice in the field.&gt; &gt; &gt; That fact deserves consideration, at the \nvery least.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Last night, a radio personality on Spooky \nSouth Coast claimed&gt; &gt; &gt; that after he engaged the dark voices coming \nthrough the box, he was&gt; &gt; &gt; physically attacked.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: \nFrank has stated that in the beginning Chris was the only one&gt; &gt; &gt; \nwho understood how the box should be used.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Some \npeople who have received boxes from Frank discovered they&gt; &gt; &gt; were \nnot able to use them although they worked fine for Frank. These&gt; &gt; &gt; \nsame people would not return the boxes to be looked at.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \nFact: After death communications have been received via both&gt; &gt; \ncomputers&gt; &gt; &gt; and phones. If it were simply the devices and not the \nusers would we&gt; &gt; &gt; not have millions of these communications?&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fact: Mark Macy states that in an after death communication&gt; &gt; &gt; \ncommunication with Konstanin Raudive in which Mark asks &quot; Can you&gt; &gt; \ntell&gt; &gt; &gt; me about the equipment you use to produce a perfect, almost \nperfect&gt; &gt; &gt; voice on earth?&quot; Konstanin replies &quot;Well it depends on \nyour&gt; &gt; reception-&gt; &gt; &gt; or mainly your psychic reception.&quot; This fact \nbacks up the theory&gt; &gt; that&gt; &gt; &gt; effective users are limited.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; Fact: In another after death communication Konstanin addresses&gt; &gt; \ncontact&gt; &gt; &gt; fields saying &quot;...but if there is dissonance in the form \nof fears,&gt; &gt; &gt; doubts, and animosities the contact field becomes \ncloudy...that&#39;s&gt; &gt; when&gt; &gt; &gt; negative spirit groups close to earth in \nvibration can break into&gt; &gt; &gt; existing bridges with troubling \nresults.&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; And so yes, maybe I wear rose colored \nglasses. However, I am&gt; &gt; inclined&gt; &gt; &gt; to believe that I have done \nmy research and have availed myself of&gt; &gt; &gt; quite a bit of \ninformation regarding this topic.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; With that said, I am \nholding an online event where people can ask&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris the questions \nthey want as long as they are formed in an&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent manner. \nIf you are interested in attending the event you&gt; &gt; &gt; can find the \ninformation on the front page of my site at&gt; &gt; &gt; \nwww.thepsinetwork.com I felt it unnecessary to attempt to &quot;bridge&gt; &gt; \nthe&gt; &gt; &gt; gap&quot; as well between speculation, insinuation and fact.&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sincerely,&gt; &gt; &gt; Babs&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Lance Oliver&quot; &lt;orbhunterx@&gt; wrote:&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; Hey Bab,&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though I&#39;ve newly begun to chime in \nhere, it seems to me&gt; &gt; that&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some people are guilty of wearing \nrose colored glasses, as far as&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris is concerned.
