I actually have been testing all of the boxes out regarding this, backed up with factual data.  I can tell you the results are amazing.  \n   \n             I would be more than happy to speak with you regarding this off the board and share some of my clips if your interested.\n   \n             I will tell you, that the box will never be able to be used to prove a death or land a conviction, just like you can not have a psychic testify in a court of law.   However, if something concrete is received in a message or response, and does in fact coincide with the coroner&#39;s inquest, autopsy reports and/or police reports I have in the past, noted the audio and documented it.  If it could at lease point us in a direction where creditable evidence could be gathered that could solve the case, or lead investigators down the right path to bring the remains of the missing home, then this could be a amazing thing.\n   \n             Right now as it stands, it is being look at as an additional resource from a psychics perspective and noted just the same.  Box communication for this purpose is so new, and most of time if you do not have access to the formal reports to back up the responses, then you can not verify the messages from the other side nor can you actually trust that the information you are receiving is truth.\n   \n              This is a very sensitive subject, and you would never want to mislead the families as well as law enforcement on a wild goose chase building up hope in the eyes of families who are will do just about anything to find answers and bring closure to grieve.\n   \n               I only work with law enforcement in what I do, and very rarely do I ever work with the family.  If I have information regarding a case, I will submit it to the authorities and only then if something I provide strikes a cord to a case, it is up to them to contact me for further information.\n   \n              I hope this answers some of your questions, for it seems we all have a common goal of utilizing our communication for the greater good.\n   \n  Juli\n\nMichael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@...&gt; wrote:\n            As most of you know, I am about two weeks old now in this group, and I love it!
