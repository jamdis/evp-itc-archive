The owner of this home asked if I&gt; &gt; would bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed with the&gt; &gt; immediately 2 way communication). So upon respectfully asking my tec&gt; &gt; if it was alright to do a session outside the my home we did several&gt; &gt; box sessions along with conventional EVP. We wanted to see if we could&gt; &gt; discover some unanswered history about the residence, and the &gt; &gt; otherside&gt; &gt; was more than willing to comply.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were and are the&gt; &gt; most boring data to review. Something I use to love so much has&gt; &gt; actually turned into a project given I am waiting for a response&gt; &gt; immediately! Too funny how things can change overnight!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I will be uploading some files for these sessions if you are &gt; &gt; interested.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Juli&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shed those extra pounds with MSN and The Biggest Loser!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://biggestloser.msn.com/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
