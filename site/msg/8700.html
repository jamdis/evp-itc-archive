Hey Stefan,

Thanks for the info I will have to produce my own sound files probably. I get messages in both German and English. Mostly English though! I'm the first generation born in the US on my mothers side. My family (the Binders) are from around Freising, Bayern (around Munich).

I haven't been posting much lately, been working too much. I work with lasers and light mostly as a transmission source. I think you are on to something with using parts of speech for a sound source. I got distracted for a little while playing with these hacks and boxes as they like to call them. They are effective but limited in my use of them.

Anyways, best regards, and thanx for the info,

Frank R.

                Hi Steve,

Margret's EVPmaker settings are listed below (scroll down).

Unfortunately, I don't have any samples of similar phoneme sets; however, I haven't yet been looking for it. What I'd be interested in are German allophones of that kind, in order to get EVP also in my language. (With the SJ file, I get only English EVPs.)

Commercial text-to-speech applications usually aren't "low-level" enough to have access to the speech elements, but perhaps research sites or university web sites are a resource for such samples?

BTW, there's a program called TalkAny from Microsoft; you can type in any text and it will speak it immediately. It has many options to alter the voice, and there's also a preset called 'Little Robot' which makes the voice sound very similar to the SpeakJet chip. I use it sometimes to counter-check / verify "EVPmaker + SpeakJet" EVPs.

Perhaps it can be used to generate an own set of phonemes / allophones.

I could upload this program, if desired.

Stefan

Stefan,

I like the use of the SJ Allophones with the EVP maker. I did send Margaret an email asking how she sets up but have yet to hear back. I have been looking around for phoneme and formant samples of the same caliber but have come up short. Do you have any such samples?

Best Regards,

Frank R.

Hi all,

although it is possible to use "Zero Cross" and "Use Cue List" at the
same time, it is unnecessary, since I had already zero-crossed the cue
ranges in Audition.

(Just a hint...)

But please, I don't wanna keep anyone from playing and experimenting.
Not seldom users discover potentialities of an application even the
developer never knew of... :)
