It would be great to have instructions on modifying a modern radio like you mentioned. I don&#39;t think I have a radio in the house any newer then 1979 vintage (ha). BTW I am still testing the manual linear &#39;spin&#39; technique. The faster the spin of the dial the more &#39;spikey&#39; the voices become. Makes me wonder if modulated pulses chosen randomly would also work. I have a crude 5 channel optical switch and will test this theory during the weekend.\n\nDave\n\n--- franks-boxes@... wrote:\n\nFrom: &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] Maybe this is clearer?\nDate: Wed, 28 Mar 2007 12:44:50 -0600\n\nI don;t like the way the image looks after converting to jpeg, all smudgy, \nso I&#39;m seeing if zipping is more better. I used Freezip.\n\nThis one is re-drawn from scratch, using the original trangle generator \nschematic I found on line for reference. I added the output buffer, made the \nfrequency adjustable, and use a different chip for it. This is what I do for \nall my circuits, modifying as needed.\n\nThe point of this circuit is to use Retro Dave&#39;s limear tuning experiment \nwith voltage tunable radios, incase anyone has one like I use lying \naround.......doh. Think I&#39;m going to have to do a proceedure on modifying an \nexisting radio for voltage tuning.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n5.5%* 30 year fixed mortgage rate.
