Here&#39;s all the new video links all in one shot:\n\n\n1. Frank&#39;s Box #27 i posted earlier with copper echo box\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIfbzoI8EmA\n\n2. Frank&#39;s Box #36\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnvRSTYrEY\n\n3. Frank&#39;s Box #39\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DDCNWW0ES0\n\n4. Speakjet Box #4\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATT047qD6sM\n\nI still have a couple more to get to eventually, but not today.\nMaybe one day we will have clear back and forth full communication,\nbut it&#39;s not possible at this point.
