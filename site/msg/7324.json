They were investigating\n&gt; an old insane asylum, and they had Chris Moon as a guest investigator\n&gt; with the box.  You can see the promo clip here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.pennstateprs.com/ps_asylum.mov\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the site for the show itself:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.aetv.com/paranormal-state/index.jsp\n&gt; \n&gt; For those not familiar, its a half hour show that follows along the\n&gt; &quot;Penn State Paranormal Research Society&quot; and different cases they take\n&gt; on.  Their niche in the &quot;paranormal reality tv show&quot; market is that\n&gt; the group&#39;s leader follows a more Christian orientated skew on\n&gt; happenings.  Lots of &quot;demons&quot; (they have Lorraine Warren guest all the\n&gt; time), and they usually try to do investigations/communication only\n&gt; during what they call &quot;dead time&quot;, 3am-4am, or &quot;the polar opposite of\n&gt; 3pm - the time Jesus gave is life for all mankind&quot; as they put it. Oh,\n&gt; and they have an &quot;occult specialist&quot; on the team that so far has been\n&gt; anything but.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the positive side, they did actually get (and record for later\n&gt; analysis) live communication on the box in response to questions being\n&gt; asked.  And on the analysis and isolation of the recorded parts, you\n&gt; could actually hear what was being said (as opposed to the usual of\n&gt; Chris acting as a go-between for very distorted sounds like on those\n&gt; youtube videos).  So it was good to see it a)working in the &quot;field&quot;\n&gt; and b)get some exposure on a tv show.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Marty\n&gt;"}
