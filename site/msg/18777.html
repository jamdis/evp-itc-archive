<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I heard the &quot;Sooo&quot; file, but i didn&#x27;t hear anything in the other file.  What recorder were you using, it&#x27;s very clear.

&gt; I was able to finally figure out how to take pieces of the files and change to MP3 format etc. The one file was at a place my husband worked at within the military so dying in combat was not a strange response.
&gt; Second was I was hurting holding something and passed it off to my husband and the &quot;sooo&quot; I feel is the one man being funny  because earlier in the EVP session I had said it hurt too but kept going through holding the dowsing rods. :o)
