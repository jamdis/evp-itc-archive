If I stop the playback just a little shorter, I hear, &quot;I hope you hear&quot; perfectly.  \nOtherwise, it comes out, &quot;I hope you him.&quot;  I&#39;ve noticed this a lot the last few days, that \nsome areas sort of blend and I have to cut a segment off where it visually looks as though \nit would be in the middle of a word, but it isn&#39;t (if that makes sense).  \n\nIf you get a chance, see if you can get the name of who is speaking.  I was very surprised \nto learn &quot;Arthur&quot; is the tech for me with EVPM, and one of my regular techs (David) even \nconfirmed this information via a manual radio sweep.  Fun stuff!!\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt;   File        : /Steve Hultay Files/Evp Maker Files/i_hope_you_hear.mp3 \n&gt;   Uploaded by : urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@...&gt; \n&gt;   Description : &quot;I Hope You Hear&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-\nITC/files/Steve%20Hultay%20Files/Evp%20Maker%20Files/i_hope_you_hear.mp3 \n&gt; \n&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@...&gt;\n&gt;"}
