I'll be the first to admit I'm no expert when it comes to ITC. The majority of 
my experience comes from working with Chris (Moon) and his box for the past 3 
years. The results still never cease to amaze me! 

Anyhow, I came across this device at an estate auction. It appears to be an 
antique communication device of some sort. The only verifiable information I 
have is that is was probably built around 1910-1912, which is before radio was 
publicly available. 
(I obtained this date from researching the packaging cylinder used to build the 
device.) 

Does anyone have any thoughts on what it might be? I did show this device to 
Chris a while back and he agreed that it probably was a communication device. He 
also suggested I show it to Frank... = )
According to Chris's box, "this IS a communication device of historical value." 
It also mentioned the device was "meant specifically for me to have, but no 
longer worked." There was more, but I'm trying to remain unbiased and only 
use tangible evidence. However, I have little to go on.

If anyone has any clues or can lead me in a research direction I would 
appreciate it! Thanks!
