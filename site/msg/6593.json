This may also help in aiding you with your sessions.  Just remember once your rock n rolling your questions along with their responses just may lead you in a direction you may never intended.  Be quick on your feet, but try to preplan if you can.\n   \n             Also, I always try and ask them if they have any questions for me or if I can deliver a message of any kind.  I never want them to think that its all about me and getting the information I WANT!  You would never have a conversation with a live friend always taking over the topic.  For if that was the case I would not have any friends, LOL.  \n   \n            You may also get communication for only you to hear, in which case you may discover that your recorder has been turned off.  I have attached a clip where I tell them to stop shutting up my recorder and their response is sarcastic as if they had no clue to what I was talking about.
