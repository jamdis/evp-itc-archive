<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Perhaps I should qualify my statement a little more. In much the same
way that Bill Chappelle has his anti-liability warnings on his
products, I made the above statement because from the moment I started
my fledgeling attempts at communication, tertiary paranormal activity
increased in my apartment by a factor of 10. Thankfully, it didn&#x27;t
stay, and I now use a protection ritual, but these were lessons
learned the hard way. I have had a few negative entitied, and
thankfully they were relegated to single curing phrases and were very
short lived. I am grateful I am of made of sterner stuff than the
activity that I am positive was a form of intimidation to attempt to
dissuade me from using a box.

My &#x27;not for the faint of heart&#x27; comment was directed at those people
who aren&#x27;t well balanced and dealing with these type of &#x27;side effects&#x27;
of box communication might cause issues or rock belief systems. I
firmly believe that a person should be prepared for these types of
thing, and even if it doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone, it is always a
possibility.

I fully agree that some are drawn to box research and some are not. On
a personal level, ITC in general is my primary focus of communication
attempts. I have definately been hooked, lol

thanks,
Andy

&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that. Not for the faint of heart?  
&gt; That&#x27;s a bit much.
&gt; 
&gt; I have 2 of Frank&#x27;s boxes. It&#x27;s as simple as some are drawn to use  
&gt; them and some aren&#x27;t.
&gt; I don&#x27;t know many who bring neg. results. That can happen to even the  
&gt; nicest people. What I can&#x27;t stand
&gt; is people tagging certain areas of research with unnecessary drama. I  
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t use the term &quot;faint of heart&quot;
&gt; for certain. As for Moon&#x27;s statements, if those are accurate, they are  
&gt; illogical. Anyone can do this research, use Frank&#x27;s
&gt; boxes, or whatever and they wouldn&#x27;t need his guidance.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone can use one of Frank&#x27;s boxes. Results vary. No drama. Many  
&gt; things can happen with this
&gt; research, but outlandish results are rare and can easily be dealt with.

&gt; &gt; I could agree that box research
&gt; &gt; &gt; isn&#x27;t meant for everyone nor is it everyone&#x27;s cup of tea. Reckless  
&gt; &gt; use
&gt; &gt; &gt; can bring negative results and that is a very real possibility, so
&gt; &gt; &gt; definately not for the faint of heart.
