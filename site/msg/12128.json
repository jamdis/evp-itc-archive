When spirit is asked the answer varies from angel, to ghost, to energy, to echo, to purples, to dead people. A few references usually match likeminded with the person they are communicating with. I tend to be very open minded so I have had all those answers and then some. \n\nPersonally I can only attest to the fact that I have had &quot;people&quot; I knew come thru in thier own voices with info that was later verified by outside sources. My first evp was of my mothers voice and it was quite unexpected. She had been passed for quite a long time. I never really went hunting for ghosts they tend to hunt for me instead.\n\nIn the end everyone will believe what they want to believe. I dont seek to change that. I dont seek to prove anything to anyone they ned to do that for themselves. In the meantime everyone can help each other and use a little tact when speaking to the energies around you whether living or dead, respect goes both ways. I see no reason for the hostility that is underlying in this field, or the jealousy as someone put it =) You are all adults (well most of you anyway) and whether you have been at this 20 years or two days I think that working together is more fruitful than working against each other.\n\nMisty\n\n\n\n--- On Mon, 9/15/08, Stephen &lt;evpresearch@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: Stephen &lt;evpresearch@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Excuse Me....\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Monday, September 15, 2008, 2:13 PM\n&gt; I was looking for conversation and insight into the whole\n&gt; aspect of what \n&gt; the voices are.\n&gt; I can leave the group not a big deal\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Lisby wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m still wondering how this list went from a\n&gt; group of highly \n&gt; &gt; researchers all using Frank&#39;s boxes, mini&#39;s\n&gt; etc., and getting amazing \n&gt; &gt; results, so people who don&#39;t even think it&#39;s\n&gt; real and have never used one.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And it&#39;s Frank&#39;s original group on top of it\n&gt; all.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sigh.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Sep 14, 2008, at 8:49 PM, Stephen wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I believe I have recorded spirits, however I have\n&gt; never used Frank&#39;s box \n&gt; &gt;&gt; so I cannot comment on it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I will record anywhere, anytime and I have\n&gt; recorded some excellent \n&gt; &gt;&gt; results.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Stephen ..\n&gt; &gt;&gt; http://evpresearch.redirectme.net\n&gt; &lt;http://evpresearch.redirectme.net&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; maggotfurcoats wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But, are there any files on this group where\n&gt; any of you believe you\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are communicating with a spirit? Frank&#39;s\n&gt; box seems to really force\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all kinds of &quot;voices&quot; out of the\n&gt; airwaves and I am not yet buying it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Does any one have anything constructive to\n&gt; say to us in regard to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; actual paranormal investigation via\n&gt; Frank&#39;s box, rather than mildly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; entertaining techno-tweaking?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I was on a multi-group investigation at an\n&gt; old historical mission in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Santa Barbara a week ago, for instance and\n&gt; watched the frank&#39;s box at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; work for the first time.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sure, I heard a few things that sounded\n&gt; obviously like radio, but we\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; did hear a very eerie woman&#39;s voice\n&gt; screaming when we were in the main\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; chapel room, and THAT got my attention.. But\n&gt; everything else I have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; heard so far in the files here is not\n&gt; striking me as the voice of any\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; apparition, due to the weakness of quality.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If you&#39;re still reading this, I have to\n&gt; tell you I have had striking\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; results in my own home, simply letting a\n&gt; recording device roll, and if\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you&#39;re not yet interested in hearing\n&gt; these samples, I guess you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more into the box than the afterlife and\n&gt; that&#39;s YOU, not me! :)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; LOVE,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Katherine.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Checked by AVG - http://www.avg.com\n&gt; &lt;http://www.avg.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Version: 8.0.169 / Virus Database:\n&gt; 270.6.21/1671 - Release Date: \n&gt; &gt;&gt; 9/14/2008 7:16 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;"}
