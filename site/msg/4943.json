It needs a program\n&gt; &gt; called &quot;firmware&quot; put into it before it will do anything useful. \nThe\n&gt; &gt; chips have a program memory which comes blank when you buy\n&gt; &gt; them.The &quot;code&quot; is the representation of what is called machine\n&gt; &gt; language that tells the various parts of the microcontroller what \nto\n&gt; &gt; do. In this case, I imagine it increases a voltage with a certain\n&gt; &gt; pattern and then drops it down to zero, starting over again and\n&gt; &gt; repeating at a certain rate. This would produce a repetitive \nsweep of\n&gt; &gt; the radio at a certain rate when the microcontroller is hooked up \nto\n&gt; &gt; the radio correctly.It wouldn&#39;t be difficult for me to write my \nown\n&gt; &gt; program to do this with a PIC microcontroller, but if someone else\n&gt; &gt; has already done it, why bother?If I can&#39;t get my hands on the\n&gt; &gt; machine code, I&#39;ll write some myself.ZackOn Fri, 4 Jan 2008, \nmllejade\n&gt; &gt; wrote:&gt; Frank, please let me know if you should, for whatever \nreason,\n&gt; &gt; decide&gt; to sell that chip (to control the scan rate of the &#39;469). \nI&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; like&gt; to purchase it from you, if possible.&gt;&gt; Thanks,&gt;&gt; Sharon&gt;&gt; \nP.S.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read the follow-ups to my initial question and being a&gt; \nlayman\n&gt; &gt; at modifying electric apparatuses, what do you all mean by&gt; code?\n&gt; &gt; Does one need the code and the chip in order to speed up the&gt;\n&gt; &gt; scanning on a hacked &#39;469; or can one do it with simply a code, \nor&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the chip, alone?&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption\n&gt; &gt; &lt;franks-boxes@&gt;&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, the guy that first made the \nhack\n&gt; &gt; was giving away a chip to&gt; control the scan rate.

I&gt; think if I used the muffled sound consistently\n&gt; &gt; they would talk&gt; through it though, the goal being to get higher\n&gt; &gt; level voices, and&gt; audio. The clarifier is just a low pass filter\n&gt; &gt; that can be adjusted--&gt; just an idea.&gt; I have some female guides \nthat\n&gt; &gt; speak sometimes, and&gt; there&#39;s the seven sisters that come though\n&gt; &gt; sometimes, but I don&#39;t&gt; know much about that. &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt; &gt; &gt; To:\n&gt; &gt; EVP-ITC@: debbie@: Wed, 2&gt; Jan 2008 10:33:33 -0700Subject: Re: \n[EVP-\n&gt; &gt; ITC] The &#39;470 mod?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Frank, Thanks for the extra\n&gt; &gt; instructions, it doesn&#39;t sound too&gt; difficult for me so I&#39;ll give \nit\n&gt; &gt; a shot. &gt; &gt; By the way, I did listen&gt; to your tone control clip.\n&gt; &gt; Since I&#39;m new to this my comments are&gt; probably not &quot;worth&quot; much \nat\n&gt; &gt; this point. I thought the entire clip&gt; itself was a lot smoother \nand\n&gt; &gt; clearer than most I&#39;ve heard so far&gt; from various sources (the \nmixed\n&gt; &gt; station sounds are in smaller pieces&gt; so for someone like me it \nwould\n&gt; &gt; be easier to pick out the EVPs as&gt; opposed to entire words from \nradio\n&gt; &gt; announcers). The short piece about&gt; 2/3 of the way through, where \nI&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; guessing you used a clarifier,&gt; sounded muffled to me, which \nmakes me\n&gt; &gt; think it would also muffle the&gt; EVPs. Definitely easier on the \nears\n&gt; &gt; but for someone inexperienced&gt; (and I seem to be the only one \nhere!)\n&gt; &gt; it seems it would be harder to&gt; pick out the real words too.&gt; &gt; By\n&gt; &gt; the way, in listening to the&gt; deluge of clips uploaded last \nnight, I\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t help but notice that the&gt; voices are all men.
