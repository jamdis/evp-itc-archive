I have been told that the communication I \nam recieving is that of spirits of human beings\n&gt; that have passed. ther very well could be communication from other \nentities that I have not gotten any conformation on.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: lisby@...: Mon, 14 Jan 2008 22:04:53 -0500Subject: \nRe: [EVP-ITC] Re: Question ..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Probably both and then some, Debbie.

Thanks for taking the time to answer .. One \nmore question .. Do you believe you are speaking to Heaven, Aliens, \nor both?? Lol ..--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Debbie,&gt; &gt; My experience is \nthat it may or may not be the same entities.&gt; &gt; I know that does not \nanswer your question, let me explain.&gt; If you are an established \nresearcher with an assigned technician&gt; most likely it will \npredominantly be the same spirit that is communicating.&gt; &gt; There will \nalso be other spirits that will come through with their individual \nmessages of course&gt; but your tech/guide will dominate the \ncommunication.&gt; &gt; There are a couple of reasons you would get \ndifferent sounding spirit communication&gt; the first being that at all \ndifferent times of the day different radio stations are broadcasting&gt; \na myriad of different sounds. The entities trying to communicate will \nuse whatever fragments &gt; of sound they need to form the message and \nthe sound signal changes from second to second.&gt; &gt; Thus the different \nsounding voices. The second reason is each different box will produce \nit&#39;s own unique&gt; sound such as the minibox as apposed to the super \nradio each produce a distinctive sound.&gt; &gt; Lastly, if you are new to \nbox research you may not have a permanent tech/guide assigned yet and \nwho ever is available&gt; at the time of your session will take control \nof that session. I find that your tech does not bother to seek out \nrecognisable &gt; noise fragments to form his or her message until you \nhave developed a working relationship as well as a personal one with \nthem.&gt; &gt; There is no exact explanation for any of this, it is all \nconjecture by the individual researcher but I try to answer any \nquestions based on my experience.&gt; &gt; I hope this answer helps. Please \nfeel free to ask any thing at any time and I&#39;ll do my best to help.&gt; \n&gt; Bruce&gt; Bruce Halliday &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: misujoey@: Mon, 14 Jan \n2008 23:51:04 +0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Question ..&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does \nanyone find that each &quot;Box&quot; has a different group of people speaking \nand helping?I&#39;ve swept &quot;Manually&quot;, used the &quot;MiniBox&quot; and \nthe &quot;SuperBox&quot; and there seems to be a different set of people on \neach device.
