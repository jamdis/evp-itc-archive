I was listening to Tom's very clear recording and decided to put it through=
 Audacity
so I could view the spectrum. Usually recordings have far too muc=
h noise for this
to work well, which is why I like the clearer and cleaner =
recordings many people
call 'Class A'.=A0 What I found got me to thinking a=
nd I want to=A0share my thoughts.

First, it's helpful to know that I have =
quite a bit of professional experience studying
spectra - from ULF up throu=
gh sound and light and way into the region of radio
waves and even cosmic r=
adiation. I have stared at more spectrum analyzers over
the decades than I =
care to count. So when I realized what I was seeing in Tom's
recording I wa=
s a bit surprised I hadn't thought about it before.

Usually when you look =
at a visual representation of an audio recording, you can
clearly see the n=
oise with the signal superimposed atop it. The higher the noise
level relat=
ive to the signal level, the lower the 'signal-to-noise' ratio which result=
s
in recordings that are very hard to hear. In a normal recording, such as =
you might 
make of yourself speaking into a microphone, there is a specific=
 way the noise
band disappears when the signal level gets high enough. But =
more than that, 
this only occurs when the signal is introduced in the earl=
y stages of audio 
processing - a noisy amplifier for example looks complet=
ely different than 
a high level background noise with someone speaking ove=
r it. And that's 
what is important here.

What I noticed that got me think=
ing was that in the spectrum analysis, 
the noise level was reasonable for =
this type of recording. And it was fairly
constant. It was what I have come=
 to see in these recordings except that
the signal to noise ratio was a bit=
 better. Meaning the signal was a bit 
clearer initially. When the sound (w=
hich seems to be a young girl's
voice) begins, the noise level rapidly goes=
 down and almost completely
vanishes while the signal goes high. This is wh=
y you can clearly hear
the voice: the absence of noise as much as the signa=
l level itself.

Now here's what got me going. I realized that this specifi=
c waveform
suggests strongly that the point of influence is not deep inside=
 the 
electronics. Rather, it is at an exterior point, such as where the si=
gnal
first enters the system. And that would imply that something towards
t=
he outer part of the electronics is being manipulated, and not the 
recordi=
ng media or anything near it. 

This would also explain why voice phenomena=
 can appear on different
media and on different electronics such as transis=
tor or solid state or
vacuum tube. AAEVP has suggested, and based on this o=
bservation
I would agree, that the probable point of influence is a junctio=
n near 
the a front-end stage of an early amplifier circuit. Every electron=
ic 
system would have this in common.

I have suggested before that I belie=
ve that at least some (probably 
the higher quality) EVPs may be due to ope=
rator PK influence.
MicroPK is believed to operate at or near the molecular=
 level as 
evidenced by things such as healing. And healing agents have
bee=
n identified who have many similar traits to PK agents. So
it follows they =
may employ similar abilities and use similar 
mechanisms.=A0 This observati=
on is entirely in line with this idea.

Does this mean that in truth no dis=
carnates are communicating?
In a dramatic demonstration of who I really am,=
 or more to the 
point what I really believe, let me say that I'm not yet s=
ure.
Maybe they are, and maybe they are not. This evidence does
not tell us=
 that answer.

This is similar to work in mediumship research. We have show=
n
that mediums can receive information they should not know in
controlled l=
aboratory conditions. But we don't know scientifically
where this informati=
on comes from. Apparitional experients are
convinced they have seen or hear=
d the dead, but apparitions of 
the living are quite common as well. The mo=
re you learn about
this phenomena, the more you realize that many commoly 
=
accepted=A0explanations fall short when applied in general.

As I wrote pre=
viously, the real issue is that science today
does=A0 not have the understa=
nding or the tools to properly 
evaluate this data. Science cannot prove or=
 disprove this 
phenomena. Not today. An honest scientist (and skeptic)
wil=
l tell you this is an unknown, an anomaly. And so, as
folks here know, it c=
omes down to belief in the absence 
of any protocol or experiment to clearl=
y demonstrate the
source of these sounds.

But I for one feel comfortable t=
hat higher quality recordings
will help move us along, if for no other reas=
on than we can 
eliminate some variables. The analysis I mentioned can't 
b=
e done on noisier recordings; it took a very quiet one to
be able to see th=
is clearly. And that's what triggered my 
thoughts.

I also noticed a tiny =
spike before and after the higher
quality speech. To some this might sugges=
t an edit, 
but in this case I don't think that happened - here's why.
You =
can see the signal emerging from the noise when
noise is still present and =
only when it achieves a certain
level is the noise suppressed. Had this bee=
n an edit, 
the noise level on this close a scrutiny would have 
been a bit=
 more obvious - unless the editor got very lucky.
But in consideration of h=
ow the voice appears and 
also the fact that similar low-level spikes appea=
r 
elsewhere in the recording, it would seem more likely
that the spikes ar=
e artifacts of the tuning that's going
on or some other random events.

Onc=
e again, this makes the case for me at least 
for trying to get the highest=
 quality possible. These
are the kinds of=A0recordings which scientists may=
 be 
able to use sooner than later as understanding and 
tools inevitably i=
mprove.

One last thought regarding the notion of PK as an 
explanation. It=
 is very important we come to understand
PK well. Only then might it actual=
ly be used in a 
practical way. I'm sure you've heard or thought about
a wo=
rld where you could literally turn things on and off
with your mind. Or typ=
e simply by thinking about it.
Believe it or not, one way forward to such t=
echnology
could well be through the understanding of PK. So much
of Parapsy=
chology is actually exploring the leading edge
(some might say 'bleeding' e=
dge) of science. It shows us
where things might go and, frankly, that is on=
e interesting
world at least for me. That's why I have been in the field
fo=
r many decades.

Apologies for the long post, but I thought some might 
fin=
d it useful and informative.
