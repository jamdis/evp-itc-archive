The QR200 has much better (higher) sampling rate and therefore does sound crisper, BUT if you put the QR200 on long play mode, it would equate to the DR60 in sound quality and maybe evp reception as well. Worth trying.\nJEFF\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Urkel23&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The qr100, i never got anything on.  It sounds nothing like the rr-dr60.  The 100 and 200 look and sound the same, but i&#39;ve had success with the 200.\n&gt; \n&gt; The dr60 is in a class by itself, it&#39;s so muddy and distorted sounding.  The 100 and 200 are nice and clear sounding.\n&gt; \n&gt; S-H\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vortex6066&quot; &lt;vortex6066@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The QR100 and 200 were the only ones that had a codec similar to the earlier DR60. I wouldnt bother therefore with any later Panasonics than the QR200. If you can get a 100, its almost identical, except it has less memory (recording time).\n&gt; &gt; JEFF\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the line of Panasonic RR does any one know which others are good besides the qr200 my recorder died on me shopping for a new one i had a  olympics\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Sat, 1/8/11, Snowfire Lioness &lt;SnowfireL@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Snowfire Lioness &lt;SnowfireL@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Another Recorder---Panasonic RR-QR200\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, rtsc@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Saturday, January 8, 2011, 12:33 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; These old ears are hearing a whisper voice, not sure if it&#39;s man or lady, saying &quot;Steve, help me&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: urkel23@\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: rtsc@yahoogroups.com; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Fri, Jan 7, 2011 6:59 pm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Another Recorder---Panasonic RR-QR200 [1 Attachment]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Attachment(s) from urkel23@ included below] \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This seems to be the second most sought after recorder for evp&#39;s, so i found one on ebay.  Much cheaper when the listing doesn&#39;t say EVP in the title.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Got this one for a song !  I was just testing it out and i thought i heard something, let me know what you guys hear.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Steve\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Steve Hultay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; www.keyportparanormal.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; www.stevehultay.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; www.rtscresearch.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
