Well, the problem RJ, is all the voices that are coming  through all the 
t=
ime, some of them are from lower levels or plains, they are  usually easier=
 
to hear, because they are closer, unless of course they happen to  be tec=
h's 
or our guides and angels.  The spirit's with the most  credibility are=
 going 
to be harder to hear, since they are well beyond  the white light, =
and are 
in much higher plains.  They read our minds, as  they can read the=
 minds of 
each other, only the ones in lower plains are not  able to read =
the minds of 
those higher spirits if they choose to not reveal  themselves=
.  Because of 
this it's going to be tough, if I gave everyone's  opinion o=
ut of the 4 
minutes, you could write a book, then when I found Dave's  voi=
ce, he was not so 
easy to hear, I had to make it louder, when I tried to  =
reach Him on Skype, 
I couldn't get what He said correctly, so it was my ow=
n  fault, and not His.

I think it does ma=
tter though. 

One of the things  we're trying to do is set up an objective=
 framework for 
experimenting  with some of these aspects.  I think we have=
 all experienced 
the  difficulty in hearing what is on some of these recor=
dings: sometimes  
we're not sure at first what it says. Sometimes we ask o=
thers for their  
input.  Sometimes we only hear it once someone else tells=
 us it  first.  
Sometimes we hear it wrong.  Sometimes we hear it  right. =
And so on.

It would be useful to know, as an individual,  how good we are =
at hearing 
it right, so we have some idea how  trustworthy our skill, or m=
ethods, or 
technology, is.  If we can  measure that, or even get a feel fo=
r it, we can 
look for ways to improve  it.  If we can't measure it, then w=
e could be stuck.  
 

So, by restricting the answers only to the timeframe=
 of the  experiment, we 
can help filter out some of the problems of subjec=
tivity:  for example, one 
theory is that people can hear what they want to=
 hear,  or can these sounds 
in a certain way, once you already know the  a=
nswer.  Or, given 2 ways to 
hear a sound, being influenced, even  subconsc=
iously, to hear it one way over 
the other.  We want to rule  that out.

Th=
is is one reason we can only count on answers given  during the 
timeframe.=
  That is when the answer is most  objective.  Once the object has been 
an=
nounced, we move into  a  period where we can't discount possible influence=
 
from already  knowing the answer.

But, I am confident that if a person's=
 method  or technology really can 
reveal the correct answer outside the  t=
imeframe, then doing it within the 
timeframe should be just as easy,  and =
would then be a valid objective result 
for all to see.

Thanks again for everyone w=
ho  participated! I admire your courage and  
motivation to try different m=
ethods, see what  works, and try to improve 
everyone's  understanding of E=
VP-ITC.

If you recall,  on 7/10/2010 I placed an object on top of my  comp=
uter 
monitor, right in front of me, and left  it there until today, 7/14/2=
010, noon 
Denver  time. The experiment was for participants to  determine =
what it was. 
Vague or partial answers  wouldn't be counted (for example, j=
ust colors,  
shapes, sizes, what it's made of, etc): we're  looking for wh=
at it is. 
Participants could use  their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or I s=
uppose  any other 
means they chose.

In order to  keep me honest, I took a=
 picture of the object  at the start 
of the experiment and loaded it to  t=
he Files section (RJ folder) of this 
group. If  you can follow the link, i=
t is here:

_http://tech.  groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/  RJ/RJ.2=
0100710. 
1.zip_ (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20=
100710.1.zip) 

The idea was  that you could download the file at the  begi=
nning of the 
test, and 'keep it safe' on  your computer. Then at the end o=
f the test, I  
would release the password so you could reveal  the content=
s of the file. That 
way, you were in  control of the original image during=
 the entire  test, not 
me. 

The password for that file  is: 123BlastOff
I=
nstructions, if you need  them, are also in that RJ folder.

And if  you di=
d not care to download the zip file before  the test, I will 
post the fina=
l image there  too.

So to the results:

Number of  participants: 5
Total t=
ries: 8
Ambiguous  answers: 0
Correct answers: 0

Object:  A radio
Uzipped =
picture:
_http://tech.  groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/  RJ/RJ.2010=
0710. 
1.JPG_ (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100=
710.1.JPG) 

So what do the  results mean? All that we can really agree on =
 from this 
experiment is that no participant,  with whatever theories or m=
ethods or 
technology  they used, was able to correctly determine the  obje=
ct. We can't say 
those theories or methods  or technologies never work. Ju=
st as we can't say  
they do. Just that, for whatever reason, they  did not=
 work this time. 
Readers can take the  results, use them to improve or cha=
nge their  methods, or 
keep doing what they're  doing.

If anyone has any =
observations,  comments, or ideas for improvement, let me 
know.  I hope to=
 get a new experiment up and running  soon. Since there 
wasn't much partic=
ipation  Mon-Wed, I think the next experiment will be  
arranged to mostly =
span the  weekends.

Again, thanks to everyone who  participated in this fi=
rst  experiment.
