Hi Frank,
 
I do the best thinking in my sleep and I usually remember it.  But  when I 
talk in my sleep it immediately gets my wife attention.  Too bad I  can't answer 
who the names are that I was calling out.  ANd all women  too.  Now why can't 
I remember them?  LOLOL

Years ago, with the first boxes, I used to wrap the tuner module with  foil, 
mistakenly thinking it needed a shield since it was in a metal car  radio 
frame-wrong! That caused some undisirable coupling in the radio  circuits, 
introducing that buzzing noise. I woke up this morning, knowing what  the malfunction 
was, and it took seconds to fix it. I think the techno  droids talk to me at 
night. 

The tuner I was using for the  most recent testing was from old #3, which was 
plagued with the noise so bad,  I used it parts--DOH!

I tell everyone, ain't no  genius! There's barely a functional brain in this 
body!  

Frank-S
