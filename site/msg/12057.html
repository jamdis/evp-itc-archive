<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hiya Ron

Nope didnt miss anything. Good question. Last time I was using AM frequency was somewhere around 550-580 (not digital so cant tell ya exactly where it is/was). The night before it was between 850-1000 closer to the 900 mark. Not sure whats better. I would just try a few spots where nothings coming thru but the sound of the air waves or radio hum/buzz. Thats all I heard live anyway.

I remember reading about other people getting contacts with an old tube radio and tuning to a section that it sounded like ocean waves... I didnt hear ocean waves but I guess the whooshing noise/static could be considered as such. It just wasnt a constant sound on mine as it was on theres. Just the hum of the radios power being on was the only contstant I noticed in both sessions. Perhaps why I hear nothing live but they all could?? No clue so I wont pretend to understand it anymore than the sweep files I get. They did voice having some difficulty on the lower freq.

&gt; Hi Misty    Maybe I missed it but can u tell me what
&gt; radio, am or fm, and radio frequency you tuned to more or
&gt; less?  Probably the best stations I can get here are the
&gt; non-stations.  lol  ron

&gt; I never had alot of luck with it either. I tried it before
&gt; with group many times but it was so distant and never clear
&gt; or just nothing at all. But every now and then when I do a
&gt; manual sweep I notice while I sit on dead air that sometimes
&gt; thats where the best evp would come thru so I started to
&gt; make it a habit that when I start and stop my sweep sessions
&gt; its off station in the dead zone. I was doing a sweep the
&gt; other night and they came thru real clear there with
&gt; messages for my friend so I thought hmmm lets try just DRV
&gt; and no sweeping and see if they can connect or if I can hear
&gt; them. I heard nothing live just buzzing noise or what sounds
&gt; like air/waves/whooshing now and then. So its not like some
&gt; get where they hear it loud and clear and have conversations
&gt; back and forth. At least not yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe a few adjustments could change that I dont know. I
&gt; never know why some days they are clearer than others.

&gt; &gt; Misty - you have a wonderful connection with them. I
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; tried DRV with no
&gt; &gt; luck. If you don&#x27;t mind I want to pick your brains
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; how exactly you do
&gt; &gt; this? THX! Great files.

&gt; &gt; I did a DRV session last night and I just wanted to
&gt; share
&gt; &gt; some of the 
&gt; &gt; results with the group. They came thru quite clearly
&gt; even
&gt; &gt; tho they had 
&gt; &gt; some difficulty making the link to where I was tuned
&gt; off
&gt; &gt; station in 
&gt; &gt; the &quot;dead&quot; zone. I usually start and end my
&gt; sweep
&gt; &gt; sessions off station 
&gt; &gt; but they had been coming thru quite clear there so
&gt; last
&gt; &gt; night I did the 
&gt; &gt; entire session that way. As always Tony was there to
&gt; lend a
&gt; &gt; hand.
