<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You know, as an afterthought, if I were an innocent bystander and heard a 
comment like this, my first question to him would be &quot;Why is it called 
Frank&#x27;s Box and not Christopher&#x27;s Box, and is Frank giving lessons?&quot;

Even if he called it a &quot;ghost box,&quot; there&#x27;s an awful lot of people out 
there who know of it as Frank&#x27;s Box.

Maybe I&#x27;m too logical in a world gone mad.

&gt;
&gt; A has-been and a never-was still continuing to cash in on others hard

&gt;&gt; Last night on Haunted Times Magazine radio , guest Brian Harnois (Ghost
&gt;&gt; Hunters International) told the radio listening audience that he didn&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; think anyone should use a Franks&#x27; Box, (or a ghost box is what he was
&gt;&gt; insinuating) unless they had training from Christopher Moon.
&gt;&gt; So... that is the topic of my blog write-up this morning if you care to
&gt;&gt; read it.
