<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have noticed a disturbing trend of box users to develop what 
appears to be an ego based &quot;mission&quot; that seems to coincide with 
these supposed technicains. You would think, since I make the boxes I 
would get some assistence from the supopsoed technicains, but there 
is none! 

 I do not know who or what communicates. I am unwilling to jump on 
the higher spirit band wagon, as they seemly produce nothing useful, 
very little verifiable information, nothing that makes life better, 
nothing that helps me make better boxes. I know only that something 
talks that shouldn&#x27;t be there, and that keeps me intrigued. As Sun 
Bear used to say, &quot;They don&#x27;t grow any corn&quot;.

 I have a &quot;group&quot; that insists I am their Space Princess, now how 
wise is it to just accept what they say, without question, being that 
I am niether female, nor Royalty!

 Curious that I make the boxes, but my input about it&#x27;s use is so 
easily dismissed.

 There is at the very least, multiple levels that can be contacted, 
some very manipulative, perhaps demonic if you want to go down that 
road. If you want them to tell you how great you are, they will 
certainly do so, that is why the caution.

&gt; Hi Frank, 
&gt; 
&gt; When you mention being distrustful of what comes through the boxes, 
are you saying you&#x27;re skeptical of the &quot;technicians&quot; being who they 
say they are?  Not trying to open another can of worms here, just 
wanting to continue learning from your experience and research.  I 
get what you&#x27;re saying about becoming obsessive with the sessions.  
I&#x27;ve probably asked you this a half dozen times over the last couple 
of years, but who or what do YOU think you&#x27;re/we&#x27;re  communicating 
with?

&gt;   Have ya tried EVPmaker? It is based on that random principle, and 
&gt;   predates the boxes.
&gt; 
&gt;   I&#x27;ve heard this stuff before, about random being the best, and I 
&gt;   have to disaggree. I also think it unwise to spend every waking 
&gt;   moment doing sessions. I think it creates that expectation, and 
&gt;   perhaps desperation to make contact, and I would tend not to 
trust 
&gt;   what comes through. 
&gt; 
&gt;   I don&#x27;t trust some of this stuff because I have yet get any 
&gt;   meaningful assistence with the boxes from the so called 
technicians. 
&gt;   All I ever got was a telepathic &quot;suggestion&quot; to use the echo 
boxes. 
&gt;   Everything else was a assemblage of stuff I had worked on in hte 
past 
&gt;   to solve the problem of &quot;what else could I use&quot;. 
&gt; 
&gt;   I hate to see yet another go down the road of &quot;this is the 
onlyest 
&gt;   way&quot;.
