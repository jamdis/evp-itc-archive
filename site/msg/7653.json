I have a digital recorder and it saves the files in WMA format. I tried saving the file in .wav, but it wont let me.  I have a 4 minute tape, but only need about 30 seconds of the tape as that is where I got my response. I am not very technical... This is frustrating as the EVP I got is really clear. i assume I can play the recorder and tape it again with sound recorder but then I lose clarity, I would imagine....  Does media player allow an edit of a file to take out x number of seconds and save to a .wav? have any ideas\n.\n   \n  My dad used to smoke Marlboro.... brings back memories\n   \n  Mike Edwards Cary, NC\n\nMarlboro63@... wrote:\n            Hi Mike,\n   \n  I am sure there are enough of us here that will help you out with the file.  You can send it to any of us and we would run it thru our software for you and send it back to you in bits and pieces.  I would also recommend cool edit 2.1 for editing the software.  It works great.....\n   \n  Jeff\n   \n    In a message dated 3/6/2008 8:39:40 A.M.
