  It doe=
sn't matter, the radio sweeps by itself anyway. Both versions 
  i believe =
have buttons on it with a digital face. Mine is White, 
  i'm not sure if t=
hat's the old design or new. The White one you 
  have to pull the pin off =
the board, it's 3rd up from the bottom and 
  says mute next to it. I used =
a pair of needle noise pliers and 
  ripped it out, but probably not the be=
st method. You probably 
  should heat up the solder on the back of the boa=
rd and than just 
  pull it out. It works really well though, i'm gonna try=
 $1 store 
  radios next and see what happens. If it works they also have $=
1 
  store speakers too. A nice $2 combo box w/speakers, sounds too good 
 =
 to be true so i'm sure you can't modify the cheap ones.
