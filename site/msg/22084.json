The other day I was reading some of Thomas Edisons patents. You could say the foodsaver was his idea. Yet his idea was less functionable. It had a huge setup and used glass containers. \nI thought I read once that they had Leyden jars in ancient Egypt and recently read of talking heads of the knights templar and Bacon. If they had recording devices to act as oracles back then I keep wondering how they worked and where the talking heads are today, or if it is a myth? They also mentioned what sounds like a robot. I wanted to share this somewhere. If these heads recorded things and are still in existence, did they record history? And if they recorded things what kind of science was used to make them?\nAlso Thomas Edison and the telephone of the dead. People grow on eachothers ideas. \nAnyways just sharing and thank you for sharing this book.I always forget what books I own. I will have to check it out.\nThanks\nJennifer\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Urkel23&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; This book is such a great read, people should check it out.  Did you know that radio sweep is nothing new?  Many researchers have been using it for years.  Franz Seidel used it in the 1950&#39;s.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I guess that&#39;s where frank got the idea, just duplicate what has worked since the 50&#39;s.  I thought frank came up with the idea of radio sweep, this book is full of stuff i never knew.  People should pick it up and read it, i got through 165 pages in just a few days.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
