Thank God for my 16 year old son who is a computer whiz! 
   
  I have one file I want to send to you or someone to see if they can hear what I hear and maybe clean it up a bit. Its a bit rough due to poor reception.
   
  I asked if they had anything they wanted to tell me and I got
   
  "Seven_Yes_We_Need_Six_More_Coffins"
   
  I wont be able to sent it until tonight. I will check the version of Audacity I have and download the lame add on if I dont have it.

  Hi Kay. I see that it's a bug (just googled the error message). Did you download the 
STABLE version of Audacity or the BETA? It seems to be a problem with version 1.3.4, and 
people are saying uninstall it and use an older version. Looks like the latest stable version 
for Windows is 1.2.6

Be sure you also get the LAME add-on which will allow you to export your files as MP3. 
Without it, your only option is WAV, which is much larger. 

Hope this helps some. :-)
