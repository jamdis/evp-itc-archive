I hear this one as German, something about teens, I think. I don&#x27;t remember 
much German. It&#x27;s been 30 years!

&gt;
&gt;It went well we got some results and the confirmation we wished for. I&#x27;m 
&gt;not releasing the test results until Laura finishes the analyzation of her 
&gt;session. It was late and she was tired. However I did some pre-test 
&gt;sessions to clear the channels that I can share some of the sounds. 
&gt;Attaching a few to this post.
&gt;
&gt;   I will try and post it all on a webpage later along with the results of 
&gt;our sessions. She couldnt make the 8 session so I began as they asked and 
&gt;did a channel clearing session, no questions asked, just recording. However 
&gt;they were already starting the session so by the time she came and we both 
&gt;sat down and asked the same questions out loud as we recorded most of them 
&gt;were focused on the test at hand.

&gt;             hey everyone
&gt;   im looking for some feedback on yalls session :)
&gt;   would love to hear the evp&#x27;s you got last night.
&gt;   Also, would like to see if you are still planning on &quot;meeting&quot; online on 
&gt;sunday to record?
&gt;   I think this is an amazing deal. It could bridge so many people together 
&gt;on both side of the spectrum. I think that it would be cool to see how many 
&gt;people are interested in doing this on a regular basis?
&gt;   I know of another person interested in sundays recording session too.
