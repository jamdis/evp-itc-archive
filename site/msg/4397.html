<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, I just ran another and nada. I can hear all the radio fragments  
just fine however, how matter how I tune it. Anyway, I&#x27;m going to  
give it a rest for awhile and try again later.

&gt; Ann, you are not alone.
&gt;
&gt; I have felt the same at times, but don&#x27;t give up.  I found that  
&gt; many times I am trying too hard to hear.  You must remain patient  
&gt; and allow time for the spirit(s) to come through after turning the  
&gt; device on.  In other words, let it sweep a bit.
&gt;
&gt; When they did come through for me, I began hearing word bits and  
&gt; then getting replies to questions.  It is almost like it changes to  
&gt; the trained ear, when it is manipulated.  You may try making  
&gt; recordings at first and then playing them back a few times.  You  
&gt; might find you have been missing someone talking to you - happened  
&gt; to me.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps...just my take on things.

&gt; &gt; I ran a session last night for the first time, but got nothing.  
&gt; There
&gt; &gt; are a lot of radio stations in this area (Baltimore-Washington)  
&gt; and I
&gt; &gt; just could not get a tuning that gave me any confidence that what I
&gt; &gt; heard wasn&#x27;t broadcast fragments--and really, nothing came through
&gt; &gt; that made me even wonder if.... Anyway, I went bed last night
&gt; &gt; thinking that I&#x27;m going to prove the exception to the rule and this
&gt; &gt; won&#x27;t work for me, but I&#x27;m gonna give it a go again today.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any of you tech guys around today if I need some help with setting
&gt; &gt; and other tech issues?
