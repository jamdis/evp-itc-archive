 depressing,

=C2=A0 
Let me refersh your memory:

Me: "I have said in the =
past, my experience with those boxes has shown me 
nothing paranormal yet.=
=C2=A0 However, people continue to say there is more to it 
than my experie=
nce.=C2=A0 And so, I am keeping an open mind and trying to examine the 
evi=
dence you provide."

You: "Well well...there it is! you have not had any lu=
ck on the box so right 
away it doesn't work. Or there has to be a some fou=
l play involved. If I could 
suggest you find someone who does has had many=
 session with the box and sit in. 
But I'm sure you would find some excuse =
why it saying whats its saying...what' s 
your take on it wait don't tell m=
e...cb radio lol"


And as everyone has pointed out to you, that's not what=
 I said.=C2=A0 It would be 
better to try to repair your reputation here an=
d just admit you misinterpreted 
me, rather than just leaving your lies han=
g out in front of the entire group and 
lose face trying to backtrack them.=
