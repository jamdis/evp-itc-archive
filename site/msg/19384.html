<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the video box again, just to make sure. Doubting
it&#x27;ll work since the TV signals are supposed to be all digital, and the
tuner is from the 80&#x27;s. But what about the rest of the cable channels, and
UHF. There is a delay with the newer TVs, it takes a few seconds to find and
lock onto the station, so sweeping the tuning in the video box just gives a
black screeen. I dug up an RF modulator, and I&#x27;ll try the old analog TV,
hopefully tomorrow, if I remember.

 Video box is just a VCR tuner swept with the random voltage generator I
used in earlier boxes, it was made in 2005, I just never did much with it. I
was in NY over Halloween and noitced they have &quot;analog Channel&quot; displayed on
the TV for some of the channels(while doing the channel flipping thing), so
was wondering what if.....Maybe I should send the thing to New York City!
