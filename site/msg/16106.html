We're not talking about a point event. We talking about high levels of back=
ground radiation, such as you would find a Chernobyl.

Again, the only area=
 that may pose a problem is the restricted area, which no on is aloud to en=
ter.

    If we're talking about radiation as th=
e transference through space of EMF, then yes it can effect equipment.  The=
 biggest example often cited is the electromagnetic pulse put off by a nucl=
ear blast, that can disable electronic equipment.  But even smaller events =
can do it: satellites have to be protected against certain radiation so the=
ir memory isn't zapped, etc.

        So it depends on a lot of things: the=
 type and sensitivity of the equipment; its environment; the types of radia=
tion to which it is exposed; and its intensity and duration.  

        As =
a side note, remember something as benign as a magnet can royally screw up =
some electronic components as well.

          Does anyone here know anything about radiation? In particularl=
y if it can cause electronic equipment to malfunction?

          Thanks!
