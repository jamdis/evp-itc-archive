When i came up \n&gt; with the hack originally for this model it seemed simple enough.

We&#39;re about ready to buy the newest RS hack radio (the 200-125). \n&gt; I was wondering if we \n&gt; &gt; needed to buy an ac adaptor for it.  It seems simple enough, but if i \n&gt; need it i have access to \n&gt; &gt; crazy electronic people (the booth techies).  I saved the directions \n&gt; Bruce and various other \n&gt; &gt; people posted.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peace,\n&gt; &gt; Nick\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
