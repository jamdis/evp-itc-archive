I'm just going to post them lol and explain them.

This one I was telling A=
 and L that as soon as I got out of the car I could hear them talking.  Spi=
rit replies "that's a first"

The next one is a forward and reverse I hear =
 "Is she the one" with a male voice. In reverse I hear a male voice say "no=
w listen"

I could feel them right on my back most of the time.  This one i=
s one of my contacts.  He must of came with me for the trip.  He says "look=
 at her" at the begining, then I talk about how I can feel them piggy backi=
ng me.

The next one L is speaking, but directly after I hear a female voic=
e sing "talk to me"

The next one we were upset about the condition of the =
grave yard.  These are monuments of their life here on earth after all.  Sp=
irit says "Once respected" 

The next one.  I hear a woman whisper in "MY v=
oice" say "I can (can't) block her"

The next one. It sounds like they want=
 the men to go.  "we all feel the men go" then a male voice says "come in" =
we were at the mouth of a trail when this was recorded, that was blocked of=
f to motor vehicles.

    Those are interesting for a gr=

    Here is two more.. LOL.. I need to motiva=

    Any way.  There was this one Gr=

smell lilacs after awhile.  It wasn't immediate, it just slowly came upon u=
s. There was nothing around us to create that odor (not even in the woods),=
 so I'm guessing they were sending it to us. When I say "what are these" I =
was picking up some of those purple flowers that grow from clover.  They di=
