Hey Frank, are you close to Denver? As mentioned, I'll be arriving on the 28th of March, and will return to pick up someone at the airport on the 1st of April, then I'll come off Estes Park on the 5th. Any of those days will work if it works for you. The 1st of April is particularly good if you're fine with that. I really look forward to meeting you.

          Hi All;

This is how I make the "echo box". The frame is 1/4 inch poplar from Lowes, 
the foil in the heavy duty aluminum foil, and it is glued on with contact 
cement. You can see the mic and speaker mounted opposite each other on wood 
sides. The sides are 1/8" plywood expoxied into the frame. It gives a solid 
mounting panel for the mic and speaker, and can be card board, as well. I 
try to avoid plasitc, as it seems to be "contra-ghost voice" if that makes 
any sense.

Frank
