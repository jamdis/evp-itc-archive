For me they are quite loud and the\n&gt; clarity was great. I\n&gt; recorded these on a night of the full moon (which does seem\n&gt; to help).\n&gt; \n&gt; Attaching a few of the clearer ones to this post and for\n&gt; those who dont get\n&gt; the dailies you can listen on my esnips site. For the other\n&gt; methods click on\n&gt; my profile there and you will see folders listed.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.esnips.com/web/NewEVPVoices\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty"}
