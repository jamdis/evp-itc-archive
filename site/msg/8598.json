EVPM is a tonal signal\n&gt; that is generated by a constricted program and does not nearly allow\n&gt; the range of nuances that a box signal does.\n\nYes, this sounds plausible. There are only 72 allophones they can use.\nPerhaps this is easier than trying to use unpredictable radio fragments.\n\nStefan"}
