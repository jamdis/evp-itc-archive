Is there a computer Voice Recognition system that can be used.\n   \n  On this subject, I recently saw a video on  AOL about a secret sentence that actor Bill Murray mumbled at the very end of a movie...don&#39;t recall the name of the movie.  Technicians somehow processed the sound to make the message VERY clear and precise.  Even I could understand the sentence.   In the program you could hear the stepped improvements of the signal till it was stepped up to the point of clarity.  Would that be possible or even useful for EVPs??  If so, how could I do that?????   Ron L\n\n       \n---------------------------------\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! Mobile.
