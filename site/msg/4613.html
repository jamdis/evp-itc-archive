<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wow, thanks for your help guys!

Ursula, your post was lovely.  I&#x27;ve been promising myself to learn 
more about Mark Macy&#x27;s work and will check out his website ASAP. 
Ritualized versus random recording makes sense to me now, as I want 
to accomplish true communication rather than continue being verbally 
abused. Have you given up &quot;ghost hunting&quot; altogether? 

I&#x27;ve been looking at the Olympus VN-4100 PC, Zack!  I don&#x27;t know if I 
need that much recording time, but I sure have liked the one I have 
and wouldn&#x27;t mind upgrading a bit.  

Hi Frank! I basically follow your suggestion when recording, and once 
I learned to be quiet I actually started getting responses. I think 
the entities at my house got tired of playing with me though, and now 
they aren&#x27;t saying anything.  I kind of miss them, but I do feel it&#x27;s 
time to move on.

Robin

&gt; Hi Robin,
&gt; 
&gt; Radio Shack now carries the Olympus VN-4100PC at about the same 
price I 
&gt; paid for my VN-960PC a couple years ago.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with 
the 
&gt; 960. The 4100 has about 4 times the recording time, I think. That 
would 
&gt; make it about 24 hours.

&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new to the group but probably know some of you from another
&gt; &gt; list.  I haven&#x27;t been too active in the realm of EVP recording
&gt; &gt; recently, but have had what I consider excellent results in the 
past
&gt; &gt; using my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 PC.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty
&gt; &gt; overwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using.  I know a
&gt; &gt; little about using good headphones and denoiser programs, but 
beyond
&gt; &gt; that I&#x27;m electronically challenged.  Still, I wonder if there are
&gt; &gt; simple techniques I can experiment with to increase my success.  I
&gt; &gt; think I&#x27;m a little bored.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#x27;ve been communicating with a very
&gt; &gt; small number of entities, and I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s due to the
&gt; &gt; limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs have always 
been
&gt; &gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside on the hill and
&gt; &gt; near the barn.  I&#x27;ve gotten two inside my house (after inviting
&gt; &gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative 
messages.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking about getting another DVR and would love to 
hear
&gt; &gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are best.  I 
would
&gt; &gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities eventually, but
&gt; &gt; unfortunately don&#x27;t have the brain for building anything myself.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
&gt; &gt;
