Yet, i did have a \ncouple problems here personally.  I guess for people who believe in \nit i guess it couldn&#39;t hurt, as for my problems i can&#39;t say it was \nfrom not doing a protection prayer but i also can&#39;t say it was.  \nAnother paranormal toss up for each researcher to decide i guess.  \nThat&#39;s why i never tell anyone what to do, there is no right and \nwrong way to do anything in this field.  People just have to draw \nconclusions on their own and get results in the way that they seem \nfit.  And than report, and not tell people for a fact that it should \nbe done that way.  Each person with their own ideas will eventually \nput all the pieces to this paranormal puzzle together.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Bad idea! In my opinion. You just create fear with that crap, and \n&gt; fear feeds itself. Once again, you will create what you expect to \n&gt; get. If you use protection BS, you&#39;ll have convinced yourself that \n&gt; there is something to be affraid of, and so you will tend to creat \na \n&gt; thoughtform to fulfill that expectation.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; everyone,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have written up the short protection ritual I use before every \n&gt; &gt; session, I have been using it for quite a while now and have had \nno \n&gt; &gt; problems with dark heads other than the occasional curse word.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I recommend that all researchers experienced and new use this or \na \n&gt; &gt; similar protection ritual before every box session if you are not \n&gt; &gt; already. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; hey it&#39;s better to have it and not need it , than need it and not \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; it!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I will post it in the files section in a folder marked \n&gt; &gt; &quot;protection ritual&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks guy&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
