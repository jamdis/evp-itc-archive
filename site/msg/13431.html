guess, so I used to have a blast with the itcs but after some of the exerie=
nces I have pretty well avoided doing anymore. we were in a rental house th=
at was not as good place to do ITCs very dark and ominuse activity in that =
place. many folks know I have been doing this a long long time and not much=
 bothers me anymore. this was 20 years ago and the tapes are still hidden a=
way in a safe place. the house I was born in was the only one more active a=
nd freaky, I have ever been in.

GP, I am glad to see you are here, a friendly face from cl=

also glad to see that this site is not all negative. I had jus=

joined last week, and made the post about the Door to the Dead; and
with =
all the negative post was thinking about leaving this forum. In
fact I had =
e-mailed Larry privately expressing that thought.

I have seen a rash of e-=
mails more up beat so I have gone back to
individual e-mails from the diges=
t. I think I will hang around a
little longer.

For other members in Texas,=
 I'm in Houston, just across the channel
from the Golden Phoenix. I see we =
are well represented as a state. I
am glad to meet all of you.

Regards,
Jo=

Its all the same "dog=A0and pony" act. Since "Ghost Hunters" has=
