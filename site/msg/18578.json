I am looking for something a little\n&gt; more objective and less subject to influence and interpretations.\n&gt;\n&gt; And stop putting words in my mouth. A person can misinterpret something,\n&gt; mistake something, or confuse something, without lying about something.  And\n&gt; before you jump down my throat claiming I am saying all results are\n&gt; mistakes, I am not.  I am performing experiments, keeping an open mind, and\n&gt; considering all evidence I find.\n&gt;\n&gt; The way you have been attacking me by calling me names at every turn, just\n&gt; because I try new things and don&#39;t always agree with your world view, is\n&gt; eerily reminiscent of the way the church of old tried to suppress new\n&gt; thought and discoveries, except you&#39;re just substituting the word &#39;heretic&#39;\n&gt; with &#39;science&#39;. and &#39;blasphemy&#39; with anything that disagrees with you.\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s an old saying:  &quot;We become that which we hate&quot;.  So far, all you&#39;ve\n&gt; done is denounce people&#39;s efforts to try new methods and see what works.\n&gt; You accept nothing anyone else proposes if it does not agree with you.  That\n&gt; is the realm of the extreme skeptic: the same skeptic you ridicule.\n&gt;\n&gt; You certainly don&#39;t have to agree with my comments.  And I don&#39;t have to\n&gt; agree with yours.

To not accept what others say is the same as calling us\n&gt; all liars, and I find very insulting.\n&gt;\n&gt;  How irrational is it to ignore all evidence and continuously try to fit\n&gt; the phenomon into a diffintion where it will not fit and does not belong,\n&gt; and then claim you&#39;re looking for a more rational explantation, it just does\n&gt; not make sense.

Since there are different distinct claims about what the\n&gt; box or the recorders can do, I try to make different distinct experiments\n&gt; for each.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some people claim they can get the box to tell them things that the\n&gt; operator couldn&#39;t know, so my &quot;whats the object&quot; experiment is one way to\n&gt; examine that.  Some people claim the boxes can make predictions, so\n&gt; cataloging predictions and examining the results can help examine that.

It&#39;s hard for me to understand them sometimes, He was also right\n&gt; about that little boy, Syler being killed, and where his body would be\n&gt; found, I don&#39;t know what they did about it though. sf\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\nI s ill say you' e wai ing o Slimme o jump ou o a box and slap you on he head. O he han ha , no hing is pa ano mal o you and he skep ics. \n \n F-S\n \n  \nOn Sun, Aug 22, 2010 a 4:16 PM, Rj as e e @...> w o e:\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI ealize you ha e plen y o subjec i e anecdo al e idence.I don' conside ha 'ha d e idence' howe e .  I am looking o some hing a li le mo e objec i e and less subjec o in luence and in e p e a ions.\nAnd s op pu ing wo ds in my mou h.
