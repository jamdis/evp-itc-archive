Thx
I was wondering if Bill Chappell made that......
I can't say for certai=
n that I trust that the Ovilus really works.......
Most of the time it just=
 keeps saying the same thing over and over again.
I will have to go check t=
hat PX EVP out on his website.
All of these devices are really interesting =
though, aren't they???
My favorite so far is MY Steve's Box........
That th=
ing is amazing..... Love it.....
Thx to Steve Hultay for selling it to me..=
..

I currently use th=
is unit called the PX. It was offered by a company called digital dowsing. =
It was offered on a limited run by the creator Bill Chappell early 2010.

I=
t is 1/2 ovilus 1/2 puck, which were 2 earlier devices created by Bill Chap=
pell. I have used this instrument on every investigation that I have been i=
nvolved with and it has provided some interesting results to say the least.=


The website with a full description on this device can be found here
www.=
digitaldowsing.com/px

Hope that this helps..
