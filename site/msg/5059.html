<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank,

Since we&#x27;re communicating with another dimension(s), then we should 
also note the time, weather, phases of the moon, any geomagnetic 
activity, solar flares, seismic activity, etc. in our area when 
conducting EVP sessions to see if we can determine when conditions 
are best for communicating.

BTW, that&#x27;s quite a colorful set-up you have!  It kinda looks like 
modern art. :)

&gt;  Never fails, when I think I have something figured out, all I have 
to do is re-test, or change the set up slightly, and get totally 
different results. It seemed for a while that the sound chamber/echo 
box was not needed, but last night&#x27;s voices were so much better--and 
longer, with that larger box with the crystal ball on top. I think it 
just depends on those undefinable conditions that govern commnication 
for the other side, we have to be able to change our setup as needed, 
or as intuition dictates. I didn&#x27;t have time to copy the voices tot 
he computer, as I&#x27;m back on a regualr sched now.
