Just adding: thats exactly how it works. When we contact a spirit or see 
one they wont talk "unless" a question is asked. Then they will speak or send 
a picture or noise or whatever.
Talking to spirits is a series of questions. One you notice that you have 
the ability, then people just look at it awhile, then it hits them to ask 
questions and then they find that the spirits answer things too. :) The box is 
a tool to bring the conversations on the outside of your head. Its a big 
deal. How did this first get thought of, Frank? How did Frank get the idea to 
ask it questions? That is what mediumship is all about.
 
My son has built one of the boxes. I am trying to get him on here because 
he will do the work for me of building them. I help a little from having 6 
months of electronics too. This is really going to go far. This is a brave new 
adventure and I am happy to be here. 
Thank you
San

My suggestions on how the boxes work are based on my own years of 
experience with random viewing fields. once it became obvious how THEY worked, it was 
a simple thing to see the correspondence with audio factor in boxes. One 
thing the boxes have taught me, however, is that it is NOT "all in the head" 
as these sound files can be shared with others.---This is making me rethink 
that my VIDEO random feild stuff may also not be "in the head, and perhaps 
may be captured on imagery.
