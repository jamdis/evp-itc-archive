In your clip &quot;The  Government \nAnnounces-- We&#39;re Travelers&quot;,  I heard &quot;Time Travel&quot; rather than  &quot;We&#39;re \nTravelers&quot; - other than that, and with the exception of the  statement regarding \nMarduke&#39;s Girl, I heard everything (and clearly I might add)  as you&#39;ve heard \nit.  \n \nFrom your main clip, I also heard &quot;The people were sick--&quot;   I heard some \nmore from the main clip but will need to listen to it  again as so many \nstatements were going by so quickly (or maybe I just need  to listen faster ;)  - \nvery intriguing and, I agree with you Frank,  the overall tone appears a \ntad negative.
