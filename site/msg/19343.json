I wonder if sleep paralysis could be caused by leaving astral state too quickly? I had never thought of this as a possible cause but now I wonder.\nJennifer\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Andrea Carr&quot; &lt;ACARR3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Really I haven&#39;t ever woken up while leaving but when coming back and\n&gt; woke up in almost a half awake state feeling trapped because I couldn&#39;t\n&gt; move until I shook it off.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Well it depends on what you mean about your wife not being gone long\n&gt; enough-LOL my hubby can snore really badly and I have had to go in\n&gt; another room to sleep. I should have him get that checked though.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Andrea\n&gt;  \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf\n&gt; Of Sumption Frank\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, July 20, 2006 2:31 PM\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] One more quake voice\n&gt;  \n&gt;  I read that in one of my Astral books, but have never tried it.\n&gt; Everytime I get close, the process of leaving breaks my awareness, and\n&gt; I&#39;m instantly awake.
