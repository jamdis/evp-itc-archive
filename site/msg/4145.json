I purchased an amplifed speaker(s) to add to the earbud \njack and an amplified mic to add to my audio recorder.  As mentioned \nbefore, my plans are to build an echo chamber for the 12-469, piping \nthe audio through the speaker(s) into one end of the box, and \ncapturing on the mic at the far end.  I am also putting sound holes \n(like a grill) on the far end, so the sound can come out and be heard \nby all.  The proect boxes come in various sizes and are cheap at \nRadio Shack.  They should prove perfect for an echo chamber. \n\nHow am I doing, Mike?\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi LC,\n&gt; Yes... that sounds like it would work just fine.\n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OK, Mike I have another question.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have the 12-469 which does not have the external speaker.  I am \n&gt; &gt; wondering if I could get similar results if I plugged a small \nspeaker \n&gt; &gt; into the earphone jack and ran it through an echo chamber, with a \n&gt; &gt; microphone at the end of the box (as Frank does), and holes \ndrilled \n&gt; &gt; through the exterior for the sound to exit and be heard \nexternally.  \n&gt; &gt; I could also use the Y and add an additional mic for the \nquestions to \n&gt; &gt; be recorded.  Does this sound plausible?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was thinking that an electronics project box would work great \nin \n&gt; &gt; building an echo chamber and adding the speaker/mic within it.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; http://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi LC,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; No, those files I posted here in the files area are from just \nthe \n&gt; &gt; 12-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 470 as it did a linear sweep of the AM or FM band, with no \nchamber \n&gt; &gt; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; white noise or amp mic.

Also inside \nis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;Listen Up&quot; amplified microphone and an Olympus digital \n&gt; &gt; &gt; recorder.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only wiring is a Y-connector which connects the output \nfrom \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; amplified mic to the input of the recorder, and also to ear-\n&gt; &gt; buds \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; listening to what is being recorded. You can also plug a \nsmall \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speaker into this if desired.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The raw audio from the linear sweep of either the AM or FM \nband \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; projected from the 12-470 speaker, into the \nclosed &quot;chamber&quot;, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; along \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with the audio from the speaker of the noise generator (&quot;My \n&gt; &gt; Lil&#39; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reminder&quot;) unit.  Those two sources, plus any ambient noise \n&gt; &gt; &gt; inside \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;chamber&quot; is picked up by the amplified mic and fed \ninto \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recorder and ear-buds. The recorder produces the .wav file.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can use a 12-469 instead of the 12-470. You just need \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connect \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a small speker to the output of the 12-469.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As with my three 12-469 system, I have so far only done the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; initial \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test run on th 12-470 system.  I hope to bring both units \nto a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where I can do some better experimentation.  I have 2 weeks \noff \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Christmas time, so that is probably when I&#39;ll be doing that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope I have answered your questions, LC.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mike,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today I modified my Radio Shack 12-469, but have some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; questions.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was easy to do, and I instantly plugged it into my \nOlympus \n&gt; &gt; &gt; voice \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recorder and recorded off of it easily.  Now I want to \npipe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; white noise in (and ambient), as well. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Is the set-up in your video what has worked best for \nyou \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computer and all)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Will you tell us what free computer programs you used \n(I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; think \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is Audacity)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) What microphone and white noise generator did you use \nfor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; travel pack unit pictured on UFOGeek.com (posted on \nDecember \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8th)?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And can you give me a layout for the wiring of it - you \nknow, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; how \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all hooks together?
