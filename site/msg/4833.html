<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks all for the info on the 470. I did call the RS 800 number and  
the person I spoke with could not guarantee that the radio pictured on  
their web site would be the one that ships (it&#x27;s a photo of the old  
model). Confusing -- he said that he&#x27;s in Louisville and the warehouse  
is in Kentucky and so he couldn&#x27;t physically check himself or contact  
someone in the warehouse. The last time I looked at a map, I could  
have sworn Louisville was in Kentucky.

If anyone comes across the old 470 in your travels, please keep me in  
mind. I&#x27;ll continue to look myself.

Any suggestions for another good hack? I did hear the clicking on the  
469(?) and it is too much.

&gt; Deb,
&gt;
&gt; The old model of the 470 is now like hens teeth I doubt very much if  
&gt; you will be able to find one
&gt; If I come across one I will let you know.
&gt;
&gt; You may want to ask at your local radio shack if they would call  
&gt; other stores and see if any of them have any in stock
&gt; I did that and wound up with 8 that promptly got snatched up by new  
&gt; researchers.
&gt;
&gt; If you can not get the older 470 maybe you can find the old model  
&gt; 469 which looks exactly like the old 470 but the difference
&gt; between the old and new model 469 is that the older model does not  
&gt; have that annoying clicking. It scans smoothly.
&gt;
&gt; I am attaching a pic of the old model 470 make sure you tell the  
&gt; person at RS you want the one in the box not the see through
&gt; package.

&gt; Steve (or anyone else who knows about this),
&gt;
&gt; The
&gt; new 470 is all black and can&#x27;t be modified as of yet
&gt;
&gt; Based on your comments about the 12-469, I&#x27;m going to pick up a  
&gt; 12-470 later today. I called our local Radio Shack and the guy  
&gt; insisted that the new 12-470 is exactly the same as the old one,  
&gt; just the case is a different color (grey &amp; black). I specifically  
&gt; asked if the electronics were set up the same way and he said yes,  
&gt; they&#x27;re exactly the same. Do you suppose he&#x27;s right about that? Or  
&gt; just doesn&#x27;t know the product that well?

&gt; There is no pulsing on the older style 12-470, just clear
&gt; communication. My 12-469 is sitting in the corner and i&#x27;ll probably
&gt; never touch it again because that constant pulse noise is very
&gt; distracting to get past to hear any audible messages. That&#x27;s just my
&gt; personal opinion anyway for what it&#x27;s worth. If you listen to my
&gt; radio shack files from today you will hear the difference between the
&gt; two boxes. The sweep between the two are both linear, but one has
&gt; the pulse sound and one is just a clean sweep without the pulse. Ask
&gt; your local radio shack if they have any 12-470 older style models,
&gt; they are gray with a white top and also has a built in speaker. The
&gt; new 470 is all black and can&#x27;t be modified as of yet but i think Mike
&gt; C. could figure it out if he didn&#x27;t have 500 other projects going at
&gt; the same time....lol Any questions just shoot me an e-mail and i
&gt; will help the best i can.

&gt; &gt; Steve, hope your holidays were wonderful. We haven&#x27;t had the chance
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; speak in a few weeks.
&gt; &gt; What are the difference in the 469 and the 470 besides 2 channel vs.
&gt; &gt; 4? You are still choosing one channel and it is still a linear sweep
&gt; &gt; right? Technically, what would be the difference in choosing AM on
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; 469 and AM on the 470? The pulsing sound is absolutely annoying.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Had a pretty good session today, i&#x27;ve been pretty blocked with
&gt; other
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes yet i seem to always get great results with the RS 12-470.
&gt; Some
&gt; &gt; &gt; really good responses to my questions. Hey babs, i think you
&gt; should
&gt; &gt; &gt; give the RS box a little time and maybe you will start to get
&gt; stuff.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Although i have a 12-469 also and it really sux compared to the
&gt; 12-
&gt; &gt; &gt; 470. The constant pulsing noise in the 469 model just drives me
&gt; crazy
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough to not concentrate. Try looking for an older style model
&gt; of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; 12-470, that&#x27;s probably the best radio i own hands down. Instant
&gt; &gt; &gt; results always and consistently. All my boxes work, but they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; finicky sometimes. No need to comment to my posted files guys,
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; &gt; listen and see if i&#x27;m on some sort of a right track with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; communication.
