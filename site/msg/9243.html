Bruce,
   
  But didnt you say that those boxes that ebay guy was over charging for would come with negative energy attached to them?  If that was the case, wouldnt we want to prevent them from being spread around?  How can we do that if we "turn the other cheek"?  Not tryin to stir the pot, Im just curious...I think the post giving free info on hacking your own RS boxes would be better than an attack of emails and comments on the guys page and would also be better than doing nothing....
   
  BUT on the otherhand...wouldnt this give those money hungry people out there a way to overcharge and take from innocent people...those kind of people would then turn around and post their hacked boxes on ebay and then we would see an outbreak of over charging and innocent people being taken advantage of...hmmm its kinda a catch 22......damned if ya do and damned if ya dont!

          Margaret,
 
In my initial reply I voiced my disdain for low lives that take advantage of unwary people
but did not advocate any action by any researchers on this board.
 
My goal is not just pacifism for it's own sake, believe me any of the old timers here can attest to my temper.
My concern is for the negative disruption in the energy flow of the communication.
I think that following the example of "turn the other cheek" will be very well received on the other side and therefore 
contribute to strengthening the bridge.
 
In the past couple of days I know Kristin has received messages about the seven and the circle, 
these are metaphors for peace, harmony and cooperation of energies within the communication.
 
It is not the first time we have received messages with these examples, I personally have received numerous 
messages pertaining to circle, circles and the power of seven. It has been contemplated in length here more than once.
 
I have, through interpretation of communication over a long period of time, come to PERSONALLY believe that the urgence of 
harmony and positive energy is the fertilizer of the growth of our communication with the spirit world.
 
I'm sorry, I drifted off the subject at hand, but my reason is relevant to this commentary. 
Taking any action against this ebay fool will first and foremost serve our ego's and secondly
may help to provide information to unwary buyers that is contrary to what this thief is putting out.
 
But could that not be accomplished through other venues that would help to educate many more people that
are would be box researchers and do not look to ebay as a source for an RS hack. But are seeking general knowledge.
 
And Margaret to thine own self be true, when this was brought up my first reaction was to figure out a way to sabotage
this guy's business venture. After thinking it over and asking myself what the first reason for doing that would be. My answer
Was, to get this asshole that is exploiting something that I hold very dear, and in turn help to steer unaware buyers away from getting screwed.
 
But still my initial and primal reason was to inflict some sort of punishment on a person that I felt was unscrupulous. And I decided that this was
a negative emotion and would generate negative energy, no matter how I tried to convince myself it was in the name of justice.
 
That goes without even mentioning the fact that we are not the say all and do all of this research. There are other entities involved that I would think 
have better influential power than we do. If they want it stopped they will find a way to stop it. I know what your going to say, maybe we are the 
tools they are using to stop this injustice. That may very well be, and if so then that is the way it will play out.
 
I think you mistake what I am implying. I am not saying do nothing, quite the opposite. It is actually our duty to do something. All I'm saying is there 
are alternative ways to educate unwary possible researchers that would be 100% positive and not entail any type of stone throwing tactics.
 
I have said my piece now at the expense of boring everyone to death. So I will see how this unfolds, and during my daily session will inquire about how our friends feel about it.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: My opinion on what should be done about ebay_I know it's long but please rea

      Hi Bruce. I don't see this so much as an assault on anyone, as it is simply bringing 
awareness into a forum (ebay) where it is desperately needed. 

Was it not you who recently stated sellers who take advantage of others in this way are "no 
more than thieves without guns" and "should not be patronized no matter the 
circumstances." You have characterized them as "wolves" and "demons" but now are 
saying "do nothing." Which, honestly, I could understand if my suggestion was coming 
from a place of vengeance. It is not.

THIS IS ABOUT EDUCATION FIRST AND FOREMOST, and standing up for those who are, 
unknowingly, being taken advantage of. The byproduct of providing this education will be 
allowing consumers to make an informed decision and if that hurts the sales of 
unscrupulous sellers, then so be it. 

Ann has just echoed some of my remarks in earlier posts in support of sellers rights to 
take advantage of the market ... that some people may find it's worth it to pay more to 
someone to receive a previously hacked unit. 

I would venture to guess, this educational information will A) help prevent those who are 
capable of doing the hack themselves from being duped, and B) force sellers who do offer 
pre-hacked units to do so for a more 'reasonable' fee. 

This is neither spiteful nor aggressive, and it's certainly not any kind of vengeance driven 
on my part. It's standing up for the uninformed, leveling the playing field for sellers, and 
it's bringing more people the knowledge that doing 'box' research is not an exclusive club 
that only the rich can take part in (and given the pricing on the bids for these units, 
people are under the false assumption that you have a pay a high price to get your hands 
on a limited resource, when that simply is not the case.)

I can see nothing but positive benefits coming from educating people about their options.

Margaret
