<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks, Bill! (Pssst...check is in the mail...he he)

I want to make it clear that I was NOT criticizing Frank about his 
box or the document! It&#x27;s just that I read it over thoroughly 
yesterday and found some things that were missing or unreadable. 
Otherwise - it&#x27;s the only &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for details on Frank&#x27;s 
box. The setup is not rocket science...anyone versed in electronics 
could build one and even improve on the design (I have several 
thoughts on that).

I haven&#x27;t had a chance to check out Misty&#x27;s &quot;sweep tuning&quot; method 
but just that name seems to indicate something close to the &quot;manual&quot; 
way of creating Frank&#x27;s box as I previously mentioned (i.e. randomly 
pushing radio buttons).

Lastly - as Bill said - he and I will be presenters at the 
conference in July. My particular presentation (which I&#x27;m still 
piecing together) will be on Paranormal Sound Phenomena. Rather than 
rehash techniques for recording/analyzing EVP - I plan on going into 
more depth on present/past research in paranormal sounds (such as 
playing the first spirit voices ever recorded, ultrasonic pulses 
detected at stone circles, etc.) and make a plea to participants to 
stretch beyond present emphasis on just recording said sounds but 
get into broader research projects. I&#x27;m not one to &quot;toot my own 
horn&quot; but I&#x27;m also slated to appear on the June 3 show of Ghostly 
Talk (http://www.ghostlytalk.com) to go into more depth on the 
famous (or infamous) Spiricom Mark IV story.

&gt; To expand upon Guy&#x27;s post, the echo chamber size can vary. Some of 
his
&gt; boxes have an internal chamber that&#x27;s about 2&quot; x 3.5&quot;. Some of his
&gt; boxes have chambers which are external and are a bit larger. An
&gt; external one I saw was made with a light wood frame which was 
wrapped
&gt; in heavy aluminum foil.
&gt; 
&gt; If someone is considering constructing their own FB then I suggest
&gt; considering the sweep tuning method also as the recordings I&#x27;ve 
heard
&gt; are impressive. We are experimenting with a RVG equipped box and 
are
&gt; getting good results but I am also interested in the sweep tuning
&gt; approach.
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, Guy and myself both be speaking at the upcoming South
&gt; Coast Paranormal Convention July 20 and 21 in Santa Paula, CA. see
