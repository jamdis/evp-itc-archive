Mike,
 
Yes I have spoken to my father, grandmother and a number of aunts,=
 uncles and friends.
When you become a box researcher and begin to do sessi=
ons, your box or any box
when it is turned on, opens a direct line of commu=
nication, A doorway if you will
between our side and the spirit world is es=
tablished in order to facilitate the conditions
we need to create real time=
 communication.
 
For that reason we are assigned what the spirit communica=
tors themselves call technicians.
What a technician is , is a spirit that i=
s assigned especially to you as a researcher and my
theory is based on comm=
unications over many sessions with my techs. It is based on harmony of ener=
gy and spirit
between yourself and your technician. The tech acts as a mode=
rator or go between for your communication sessions
guarding that open door=
way and assisting in any way that is needed to help get your communications=
 across and
the responses that you receive will either come through him or =
her, or your tech will help facilitate communication
between another spirit=
 and the researcher.
 
On your next session ask about your tech and if you =
have been assigned one, if so what is their name. 
If you have been getting=
 a name that has been coming through consistently that is probably your tec=
h.
As you become more experienced and over the course of many sessions, lik=
e any other person you deal with on a regular basis
you will develop a rela=
tionship with him or her. The stronger your bond becomes the better your co=
mmunication will get.
Also a very important factor in strong communication =
is state of attitude, to have strong and beneficial communication you need =
to approach 
a session with a positive and open attitude. Good vibrations s=
trengthen the bridge, negative vibrations weaken it and attract negative en=
ergy.
 
I have been involved in the paranormal in one sense or another for =
almost ten years. I started as a field investigator and progressed to the p=
oint I am at today.
When I discovered real time spirit communication, or bo=
x research it was still in it's infancy. the only box being used by only a =
couple of individuals was Frank's box
through contacts I made I became acqu=
ainted with Mr. Sumption and was lucky enough to receive a Frank's box #12 =
Also at that time Joe's box had been established 
and I received one of tho=
se and started my research. At that time there where only about three of us=
 tat where doing continuous research and stumbling around
Trying to figure =
out what, when, why and how! but that's what led us to helping develop the =
communication. And eventually learn enough to be able to help 
others that =
become interested in becoming box researchers.
 
As far as conducting your =
sessions, you are only just starting out. You need time and our friends on =
the other side need time to get to know each other.
Each of us has our own =
unique spiritual energy and like someone that joins say a softball team jus=
t as an example. you will be treated cautiously but it will take time to ge=
t 
familiar with your team mates and become an accepted member of the team.=

Start with short common questions and comments and expect short and someti=
mes no response in the beginning. that is not due to their lack of wanting =
to communicate
but like I said it takes time to build that bond and make th=
e channels of communication strong and reliable. Ask basic questions that w=
ill most likely result in you hearing 
and understanding the answers in rea=
l time, this will not only develop your confidence as a researcher but also=
 give you the personal validation that we all need to know
that in fact we =
are communicating.
 
AND record everything!! I can't stress that enough. In=
 the beginning until your ear is developed for filtering out the communicat=
ion from the crap, you will need to
refer back to the recording to confirm =
what you believe you heard.
 
I hope this helps.

Br=
uce, have you been able to contact your personal friends and family members=
 yet? Also how do you build this initial bond with the regular spirits you =
contact. For example, how did you make your first friendship? What started =
your conversation/interest in the spirit? Did they contact you and what was=
 the initial topic of conversation, first timemeeting, and what do you talk=
 about each time there after?
