&gt; I can see how it is a portability issue.  I used to work at a recording
&gt; studio that had 4 reverb plates from the 1950&#x27;s.  They were so big that they
&gt; had to be hung in a semi trailer.  All audio outboard reverb&#x27;s available
&gt; today function on the same principle as your echo chamber, but the use solid
&gt; state circuitry and chips to accomplish the task.
&gt;
&gt; Is it possible to include an echo chamber section that is separate from the
&gt; internal component section of your box?  A box connected to your box but is
&gt; separated by thick wood?  This may cut down on your problem of portability,
&gt; but may not entirely get rid of the problem because waves are so large that
&gt; they conduct through wood (put your ear to the back of an electric guitar or
&gt; bass and strum it, you will still hear a little).  If you attached your
&gt; chamber to the box, had it separated by solid wood, and gave it ventilation
&gt; slits, you might not have this problem anymore.
&gt;
&gt; The demonic sound is not surprising.  Most commercial reverbs allow for
&gt; pre-delay (the sound and then the reverb) in milliseconds, and decay (how
&gt; long the sound lasts after).  Your echo chambers don&#x27;t have this so if you
&gt; build it on a big board, it is like the reverb is equivalent to yelling in a
&gt; concert hall versus if your echo chamber was built on a smaller board it
&gt; would sound like yelling in a bathroom.  The safe effect, only the result is
&gt; curtailed.
&gt;
&gt; The original reverb plates which are kind of like your current echo chamber
&gt; were built in a wooden box that had limited width but were significant in
&gt; length and height.  Inside of the box were two metal plates.  The sound was
&gt; fed into the box and the amount of reverb was controlled by turning a wheel
&gt; that moved the plates closer to each other or farther apart, and this
&gt; controlled the amount of the reverb.
&gt;
&gt; Your boxes will always sound better with reverb, it is like singing in the
&gt; shower.  Because of the reverberation the voice sounds fuller.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Feedback is the big problem with the internal echo chamber. For a while I
&gt;&gt; was leaving out the echo chamber, but trying to provide external chambers
&gt;&gt; was a problem too, it makes the box less portable. The chamber adds
&gt;&gt; &quot;something&quot;, kinda like a filter, plus &quot;they&quot; seems to be able to make their
&gt;&gt; voices easier. Usually I can drill holes in the cabinet to relive the
&gt;&gt; feedback, with this box I had to seal the whole thing with silicone. I had a
&gt;&gt; better seal between the battery compartment and the main compartment, so I
&gt;&gt; guess sound was finding other ways to interact.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  The chamber speaker is less than an inch in diameter, and the mic just a
&gt;&gt; standard electret.  I use three tubes, instead of the two shown in the
&gt;&gt; diagram so I can get more separation. The larger the chamber the more
&gt;&gt; pronounced the enhancement effect, the voices are almost scary. I made one
&gt;&gt; once that was 12 inch by 48 inch MDF board lined with aluminum foil with
&gt;&gt; crystals and magnets glued on the insides, OMG  I had to take to it apart!
&gt;&gt; That was frikkin&#x27; demonic.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  That&#x27;s one reason I don&#x27;t have a fixed design, there&#x27;s just too much to
&gt;&gt; this.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a simple concept as to why the vents cut down on feedback.  As a
&gt;&gt;&gt; former live sound engineer, feedback was quite the nemesis.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If I remember reading right, you have a small microphone and a small
&gt;&gt;&gt; speaker in your &quot;echo chamber.&quot;  A feedback loop happens when a speaker
&gt;&gt;&gt; produces audio and a microphone pics that audio up.  The thing is, if the
&gt;&gt;&gt; speaker and microphone are not far enough apart from one another, a feedback
&gt;&gt;&gt; loop occurs where the audio loop between microphone to speaker keeps
&gt;&gt;&gt; building up and frequencies start to converge into feedback.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Considering that your echo chamber is right under the batteries, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; microphone in the echo chamber is probably picking up the audio from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; main speaker output at the same time as the output that is in the echo
&gt;&gt;&gt; chamber.  The two sources picked up at the same time is causing the
&gt;&gt;&gt; feedback.   By venting the battery chamber, the soundwaves from the main
&gt;&gt;&gt; speaker  are being released easier from the hollow design of the box.  This
&gt;&gt;&gt; allows for the natural reverberation caused by speaker output to stop
&gt;&gt;&gt; reverberating around inside the box, it is this bouncing around of audio
&gt;&gt;&gt; that is= eventually picked up by your echo chamber microphone at the same
&gt;&gt;&gt; time and becomes feedback.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The same thing happens during a concert when a performer gets his
&gt;&gt;&gt; microphone to close to the floor monitor.  A feedback loop occurs because
&gt;&gt;&gt; the singer hear&#x27;s his voice in the floor monitor at the same time as it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; coming out of his mouth.  A loop occurs where the frequencies build upon
&gt;&gt;&gt; each other and feedback happens.  In your case, the microphone inside the
&gt;&gt;&gt; echo chamber is simply picking up the main speaker at the same time as the
&gt;&gt;&gt; speaker in your echo box, causing the same audio pattern.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The battery box is on top of the echo chamber, and venting the door
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; helps cut the feedback for some weird acoustical reason. The new box should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be &quot;92&quot; doh!

Is i possible o include an echo chambe sec ion ha is sepa a e om he in e nal componen sec ion o you box?  A box connec ed o you box bu is sepa a ed by hick wood?  This may cu down on you p oblem o po abili y, bu may no en i ely ge id o he p oblem because wa es a e so la ge ha hey conduc h ough wood (pu you ea o he back o an elec ic gui a o bass and s um i , you will s ill hea a li le).  I you a ached you chambe o he box, had i sepa a ed by solid wood, and ga e i en ila ion sli s, you migh no ha e his p oblem anymo e.


The demonic sound is no su p ising.  Mos comme cial e e bs allow o p e-delay ( he sound and hen he e e b) in milliseconds, and decay (how long he sound las s a e ).  You echo chambe s don&#x27; ha e his so i you build i on a big boa d, i is like he e e b is equi alen o yelling in a conce hall e sus i you echo chambe was buil on a smalle boa d i would sound like yelling in a ba h oom.  The sa e e ec , only he esul is cu ailed.

 Feedback is he big p oblem wi h  he in e nal echo chambe . Fo a while I was lea ing ou he echo chambe , bu ying o p o ide ex e nal chambe s was a p oblem oo, i makes he box less po able.

Usually I can d ill holes in he cabine o eli e he eedback, wi h his box I had o seal he whole hing wi h silicone.

 The chambe speake is less han an inch in diame e , and he mic jus a s anda d elec e .  I use h ee ubes, ins ead o he wo shown in he diag am so I can ge mo e sepa a ion.

I is a simple concep as o why he en s cu down on eedback.  As a o me li e sound enginee , eedback was qui e he nemesis.   

I I emembe eading igh , you ha e a small mic ophone and a small speake in you &quot;echo chambe .&quot;  A eedback loop happens when a speake p oduces audio and a mic ophone pics ha audio up.  The hing is, i he speake and mic ophone a e no a enough apa om one ano he , a eedback loop occu s whe e he audio loop be ween mic ophone o speake keeps building up and equencies s a o con e ge in o eedback.  


Conside ing ha you echo chambe is igh unde he ba e ies, he mic ophone in he echo chambe is p obably picking up he audio om he main speake ou pu a he same ime as he ou pu ha is in he echo chambe .  The wo sou ces picked up a he same ime is causing he eedback.   By en ing he ba e y chambe , he soundwa es om he main speake  a e being eleased easie om he hollow design o he box.  This allows o he na u al e e be a ion caused by speake ou pu o s op e e be a ing a ound inside he box, i is his bouncing a ound o audio ha is= e en ually picked up by you echo chambe mic ophone a he same ime and becomes eedback.


The same hing happens du ing a conce when a pe o me ge s his mic ophone o close o he loo moni o .  A eedback loop occu s because he singe hea &#x27;s his oice in he loo moni o a he same ime as i is coming ou o his mou h.  A loop occu s whe e he equencies build upon each o he and eedback happens.  In you case, he mic ophone inside he echo chambe is simply picking up he main speake a he same ime as he speake in you echo box, causing he same audio pa e n.


Hope his helps,
