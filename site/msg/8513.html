<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve been using EvpMaker by Stefan Bion, who is on this board.  It&#x27;s 
freeware and works great, you should try it out.

If you need any further assistance, just e-mail me and i will send 
you more in detail along with the Wav. file Stefan supplied 
containing several different tones of audio they can use to form 
words.
