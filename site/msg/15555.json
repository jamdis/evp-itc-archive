Im sorry your name got dragged into it simply because he was addressing you in his post attacking Frank. \n\nI know you like to try and find something good in everyone, so turn the other cheek if you must, get your blinders on, start sweeping. You wont get banned by anyone here for being too nice too people.\n\nBut dont be naieve either, he DOES MRAN TO DO IT. Otherwise he wouldnt continue to do it over and over and over and over again. These people have witnessed this guys attacks and lies for many years and they refuse to not see him for what he is. They have also witnessed how generous Frank can be and know hes not in it to gain fame or make money.\n\nMisty"}
