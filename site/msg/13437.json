I watch them as \nentertainment, and nothing more.\nYes, there are some real investigations going on concerning the \nparanormal, EVP, ITC spirit communication, entity dicovery, etc., but \n99.9% of the time you will not be witnessing a real investigation \ngoing on in a reality TV show. (G.H. DttD, P.S., etc.)\nThese type venues are about making money in the form of advertising \ndollars.\nYour REAL investigations are being done by &#39;unknowns&#39; and people, and \ngroups with nothing more than a few tools and a cheap video camera; \nnot TruTV, Discovery Channel, or History Channel.\nYou usually don&#39;t see REAL investigations on TV.\n\nYes, Ghost Hunters is the self proclaimed number one paranormal venue \non the tube, but do you really think they are following REAL \ninvestigative techniques?\nIf you&#39;ve seen the show... you should have that answer.\n\nG.H. is scheduled to come to a local Inn near me; an Inn that has \nvery very few incidents of paranormal activity in its past history.\nBUT, I bet when I see that episode on G.H., there will be more \nactivity in the first hour of the show than has gone on in the entire \nhistory of the INN.  WHY???  Becasue it&#39;s reality TV and to make \nmoney they have to induce activity and action... otherwise no one \nwill watch.\n\nSo... bottom line.  Don&#39;t view shows like G.H., Door to the Dead, \nParanormal State, and the others as the definition of an \ninvestigative series... watch them for the entertainment value, and \nyou won&#39;t be dissapointed.....\n\nOkay... stepping off the paranormal soapbox now.\nThanks for listening!\n- Mike C.  (UFO Geek) http://www.ufogeek.com\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, John S &lt;phenom_investigator@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am pleased that the outcome for the family was positive. And I am \nnot surprised. The key I think is that a belief system was \nsuccessfully altered. This in turn likely impacted the focal person, \nwho based on the limited information presented could have been the \nyoung man. \n.........to achieve them most likely. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your interest as this is an important topic of \ndiscussion.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;"}
