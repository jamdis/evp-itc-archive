<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>LOL!  You are now ruined!  That is to say, &quot;hooked!&quot;  I knew it would 
happen for you!  Awesome!

Yesterday, I was bugged to just listen to the sweep, and I immediately 
heard my wife&#x27;s name.  Hmmm.  Wouldn&#x27;t you know she called me within a 
couple minutes by telephone. I think some of this we pick up is to 
prove to us that there&#x27;s something there - an attention getter of 
sorts.  Sounds like you have had yours, Ann...

&gt; I think. I&#x27;m still having a hard time convincing myself that I&#x27;m not  
&gt; matrixing this whole thing, but the box has been repeating the 
number  
&gt; seven, the name Frank, the name Eva, had a bout of swearing, and 
then  
&gt; completely stunning me by seemingly saying that Tom was here, &quot;Your  
&gt; Tom.&quot; Which blew me away because I have a great uncle named Tom 
whose  
&gt; burial records I was looking for just last night. Finally a female  
&gt; voice told me, &quot;Ann stop.&quot; I said okay and she returned, &quot;Thank you.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I hope no one minds my sharing. This is a big moment for me.
