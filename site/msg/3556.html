<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi, guys--

If anyone feels like enlightening a newbie, I need some clarification:

As a &quot;ghosthunter&quot; I always wore headphones while recording EVP in 
the field so that I could hear the responses in real time.  Now, 
while engaged in this structured in-home ITC experimentation, I am 
getting a lot of different results and hearing a lot of conflicting 
information.

My first voice I heard in real time through my headphones, and it 
came as a gravelly whisper in reponse to my question.  My second 
voice was loud and clear but I didn&#x27;t hear it through the headphones 
while recording.

From all of the talk about the various boxes, I am hearing that the 
great thing about them--and the allegedly dangerous thing--is that 
you can have conversations in real time because you can hear the 
responses while recording.  But, from what I&#x27;ve read in extensive 
sources, I have garnered that the messages are IMBEDDED into the tape 
during the recording and cannot be heard until playback.  

But I HAVE gotten real time responses, so  . . . since I have gotten 
responses in real time without a box, is it that the boxes increase 
the incidence of real time answers?  Or am I trying to find solid 
answers to questions that are still not answerable?

Hope this makes sense, and thanks,
Ursula</pre>
