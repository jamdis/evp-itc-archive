Is this from a recorder? It sure sounds like a spirit to me.

&gt; Hi all, new to the group...I recorded this by accident on plane last 
&gt; year while waiting to take off, and trying to figure out an mp3 
player 
&gt; my son just bought me.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s real or not...I remember 
&gt; no one was talking around me at the time...could it have been some 
&gt; random fabric sound?
&gt; 
&gt; If it is real, how likely for someone on the other side to be on an 
&gt; air plane, and what kind of help would they need?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Rob
