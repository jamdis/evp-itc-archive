whole story with the clips!

&gt; Yes it has Ann!  The amazing things are that some of the clips say  
&gt; the full names of the former residents.  This is a famous story as  
&gt; well and once we get the ok, I will be more than happy to share  
&gt; with all of you.  This houses history go&#x27;s back to the 1800&#x27;s and  
&gt; has been documents up until the current owner.
&gt;
&gt; One of the former residents divorced his wife (which is documented  
&gt; in court records) because of abuse from the children.  This took  
&gt; place in the civil war ara and in fact was able to collect his  
&gt; civil war pension.  It is believed that some of the beating may  
&gt; have taken place by the creek with a whip (which is actually  
&gt; mentioned in the clips).

&gt; I know you can&#x27;t disclose the location, but can you summarize the  
&gt; haunting and what you got from the box session? Has any of it  
&gt; checked out in the historic records yet?

&gt;&gt; These files are the responses we got when asked if something  
&gt;&gt; tragic happened in the home.  The last one clearly reflects that a  
&gt;&gt; possible negitive spirit didn&#x27;t want us asking anymore questions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Let me know what you think!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks!
