The last one about Coffee-it is pretty clear to me. That one I am impressed=
 with for sure. But the others I can't really get all of what your getting.=

   I rarely know =
if anyone hears this stuff, as few comment. The one about sausage is kinda =
iffy."Princess, I never Liked that box..." is the same on as "Princess I lo=
ve that box...", I just hear it different this morning. That's the only one=
 I hear different from last night. I included the forward, and reverse comp=
onents. 

   These are from the test I did to see if I could use a pre-reco=
rded RAW audio tape in areas wherer there's no radio stations, sincve many =
insist on going to "haunted locations" that have few, if any radio stations=
 to use for the raw audio. #48 has an aux input so other raw audio can be u=
sed.
