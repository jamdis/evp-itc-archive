I have been a member of this group for a little while now, and I finally have a question..lol..\n\nI have always been interested in EVP work, but have never really had the opportunity to &quot;try for myself&quot;...I am soo far from mechanically inclined it isn&#39;t funny, and don&#39;t have alot of money to spend...\n\nAre there any suggestions on what I can do to start out maybe? Something cheap? That is easy to use? I have an old &#39;Realistic&#39;\ncassette recorder with variable speech control ( pitch and speed controls)...is this anything that I can experiment with? Will it work (even for now until I can afford something better? lol)\n\nThanks in advance all!!"}
