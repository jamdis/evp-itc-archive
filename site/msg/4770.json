I believe that box become the portal to hell for me so i \nstay away or at least for now anyway.  Reception is never a problem \nfor me, but not all devices work well everyday.  Frank&#39;s box #27 is \nvery noisy but always gives me very direct answers to my questions \neverytime.  All of them have given me great results at some point and \nwhen newer stuff comes out i will try them too.  Never get stuck on \none particular method or box, you have to mix it up all the time to \nget different responses.  Some days i just feel like doing a manual \nsweep, it&#39;s always different.  If i can get the Minibox to give me \nreal time answers than that would be the best because of the clarity \nof the radio.  The minibox is so clear to listen to, but you have to \ngo over it with headphones and patience to find out the answers.  The \nanswers are there though, so maybe i just have to get used to the way \nit works a little better.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, juli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; It funny just how they know what box&#39;s your using.  I started with \nthe 469 first, they told me to switch to the 470 and the reception \nstunk, so we switch back.  I alway ask them, which reception is \nbetter on the otherside.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Juli\n&gt; \n&gt; Steve Hultay &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           \n&gt; Had a pretty good session today, i&#39;ve been pretty blocked with \nother \n&gt; boxes yet i seem to always get great results with the RS 12-470. \nSome \n&gt; really good responses to my questions. Hey babs, i think you should \n&gt; give the RS box a little time and maybe you will start to get \nstuff. \n&gt; Although i have a 12-469 also and it really sux compared to the 12-\n&gt; 470. The constant pulsing noise in the 469 model just drives me \ncrazy \n&gt; enough to not concentrate. Try looking for an older style model of \nthe \n&gt; 12-470, that&#39;s probably the best radio i own hands down. Instant \n&gt; results always and consistently. All my boxes work, but they are \n&gt; finicky sometimes. No need to comment to my posted files guys, just \n&gt; listen and see if i&#39;m on some sort of a right track with the \n&gt; communication.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                          \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private & \nconfidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is \naddressed to.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;   No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or \nforwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.\n&gt;"}
