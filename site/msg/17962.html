Try anyway though.  I don't know how your personal  beliefs here work, bu=

others seem to get messages about people they've  never heard of, or pla=

I would also  suggest anyone who tries this exper=

be  accused of losing any.

All you have to do is ask your boxes/spirits/  aliens/etc, w=

I have taken a picture of it, and  posted it to the files secti=

there is no way I can squirm  out of the results:

Please d=

downlo=

it  =
during, or after, the test.

Answers anyone reveals after noon  Wednesday d=

Best of Luck. I hope for =

I hope we all can learn =
