Hi Lee,

You may be looking for Frank Sumption, he was the one on Art Bell'=
s show. He is also a friend of mine!

Suicide is never a pleasant subject, =
especially when committed due to emotional distress. No religion or spiritu=
ality supports this as a solution to any issue and believe it makes the "be=
yond" more difficult to navigate and understand. With that being said, the =
apparition that is being seen and the religious rites being asked for can m=
ean a number of things. The most likely is she feels like she needs these t=
hings to move on. She is probably fearful that her act has made her unfit f=
or life beyond our world. Most likely she was Catholic if she was asking fo=
r a mass (Catholics will not do this for suicides). 

What needs to happen =
is she needs to be reassured that she and all other entities of God are wel=
come and expected to evolve to higher planes. When we die we only are allow=
ed to see and experience what we are ready for or within our comfort range.=
 Lets say its designed into the system (for the lack o a better description=
). The only barriers to her spiritual evolution are in her mind, God and th=
e afterlife is always present but is not always visible.

Most likely she w=
as in a bad emotional place when she was alive and was the reason for her s=
uicide. That will carry on for a time until she snapps out of it. There are=
 always helpers with her whether she understands that or not.

Regards,

Fr=
