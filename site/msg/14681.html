It is an attached, single family home,. The complex was built in the 70's, =
so I am sure the wiring is old. I do not know if it is aluminum though.

Yo=
u make a good point, that tapping could be coming form something not direct=
ly related to the wiring, but tapping because of the surges it receives.

   We have a touch lamp that comes on by itself,=
 and we have electric matress heaters that make a clicking noise in the rad=
io when the controller is on. When the furnace comes on, it affects the box=
es, and--when I first started doign EVP recordings with white noise, if the=
 furnace happened to come on when I was recording a voice would report "it'=
s on fire!".

   What if that house has aluminum wire?

            Yes.  Also faulty wiring, which =
is even more dangerous.
            Also with flakey transformers or other =
power distribution in the area, or power lines.
            Perhaps you can=
 check with some neighbors, and see how their power is doing.

              Hi All,

              Is there s=
omeone here that can answer and electrical question for me?

              =
During the case that I recorded those possible EVP's-there was a loud tappi=
ng noise that seemed to come from the 2nd bedroom. Upon checking my logs, e=
very time one of  these clicks were heard, there would be an EMF spike in t=
he livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livingroom downstairs. The =
home owners have also reported that they have a touch lamp that comes on al=
l the time by itself and the lights in the Kitchen will dim occasionally.

=
              Now these taps are not consistent in timing, loudness or rhyt=
hm. Could this be the work of faulty breakers?

              Thanks!
     =
         April
