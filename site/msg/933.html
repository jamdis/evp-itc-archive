<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, I got this tonight and it sounds like the same voice swept through several station channels. Could they be talking about the Christopher who uses one of your boxes?

&quot;Our Chris.....Is giving a reception&quot;

&gt; WOW!! I am amazed that someonme actually tried this! It does work. 
There was 
&gt; a Danish(I think) researcher doing the same thing, but never could 
make 
&gt; contact with them. I have done this myself, and it can work wiht TV 
too, if 
&gt; you can switch channels fast ennough. I think you could use a 
steeper motor 
&gt; controler to randomly turn a stepper moter, to turn the dial. 
Manually 
&gt; spinning the dial has one advantage, the sound is clearer! I have 
yet to see 
&gt; a method of ITC that produces better results that the random tuning 
methods.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning 
system. I tried 
&gt; &gt;several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner through the 
AM band 
&gt; &gt;late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the dial moving at a 
constant 
&gt; &gt;rate of speed. This is not nearly as good as Frank&#x27;s &#x27;hands off&#x27; 
random 
&gt; &gt;tuning method but it still produced some results. What impressed 
me most is 
&gt; &gt;that some of the voices sound the same, even though I tuned 
through several 
&gt; &gt;channels. This attached capture could be a technical message.
&gt; &gt;&quot;Plug a million hertz&quot;   One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which 
is close 
&gt; &gt;the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.
