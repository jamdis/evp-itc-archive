<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

I can only speak for myself, but here it is:

Awhile ago, another skeptic (or two?) left the list, and I thought it was okay to post here.  Then, &quot;Rj&quot; and friend filled in the skeptic gap, big time.  

I deal with enough critics and skeptics in the rest of my work. I don&#x27;t work nearly as well when I&#x27;m upset, and fretting because someone has insulted me (or my intelligence) or someone I respect, like Frank.

I&#x27;m learning that insulating myself allows me to focus on my work. If that&#x27;s what I have to do... well, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do.

I&#x27;ve been in &quot;wait and see&quot; mode here, in case there are yet more critics and skeptics who&#x27;ll fill in the &quot;Rj&quot; gap.  I want to believe that everything&#x27;s okay now, but I&#x27;m still stinging from recent negative comments, on and off of this list.

But mostly, I&#x27;m about to leave for my biggest annual gig, in a field that&#x27;s become more land mines than safe paths.  Between the anxiety and the pre-event preps, I&#x27;m in lurk mode here... and I&#x27;ll be offline entirely for most of the first two weeks of September.

So, those are the reasons why I&#x27;ve been quiet.

In haste,
Fiona

&gt;  Soooo, the skeptic types are responsible for most of the dialog?  Weird,
&gt; you&#x27;d think more would feel safer posting and commenting. Get rid of the
&gt; ones that accept no evidence, can&#x27;t test, ignore all of our resutls, can&#x27;t
&gt; hear and acuse us of halucinating this and---dead silence. Human psychology
&gt; is beyond my comprehension!
