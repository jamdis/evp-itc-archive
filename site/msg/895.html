LOL I meant so kind of you to offer KEN. Works rotting my brain LOL, sorry was a long day and I was tired. 
   
  I looked up this parts pic and I'm trying to understand how that gets turned into a mic. You wire the mic jack to it somehow to plug it in? I get a good discount at the radio shack here so thats no problem. 

  I also ran across something about using your pc usb as a reciever for AM radio frequency.
   
  Ok off to work again. I'll try and check back later =)

          i just got my first clear voice on a digital recorder a cheap 
chinese one from the drugstore. the more times i played it the 
clearer it got UNTIL i turned the recorder off prior to transferring 
to computer. probably whatever biases the flash memory isnt quite up 
to what it should be.

on 1n34 "conditioned" diode; this is one of many things i use to test 
for extremely low level non-randomness in noise floor.

ordinarily, i am literally bedevilled by "angels" trying to speak 
into receiver. gradually i am establishing that a principle 
called "giant negentropy" may be partly due to the efforts of living 
or once living entities from multiple "elsewheres" trying to cohere 
or phase-align noise --which is basically what all life does anyway, 
we increase the sun's entropy and temporarily reverse our local 
entropy.

duh

in english:

life, including life that we cant presently comprehend , like trevor 
constable's sky creatures or the "rods" or remnant cast-off shells 
of human souls may be hard wired to alter its environment thereby 
having a microscopic modulating effect on the local physical laws and 
constants.

it only SOUNDS esoteric; you already know it.

i can make some extra 1n34 diodes for unusual recording opportunities 
i expect first week of april but i need an address to send them to.

i run a bunch of yahoo groups of my own and i know that it 
isnthealthy to start sending home addresses back and forth so maybe 
one brave foolcan volunteer.
