Not only that, I don&#39;t ask \nquestions (or rarely ask questions), nor ask for any certain \nindividuals. I used to protection stuff, particuallt Native Amnerican \ntype pipe ceramony, but they convinced me to stop smoking, and I won&#39;t \neven touch the pipe for fear of the tabaco hook. So I just don&#39;t do any \nof that stuff, and it doesn&#39;t seem to matter. \n\n Frank-S"}
