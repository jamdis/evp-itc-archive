I started out with EVPmaker in 2001, using a couple minutes of different talk radio shows I recorded and copied to the computer. \n\nF-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; yup heard it all Thanks Frank cool..I&#39;m still trying to find a file to use to try it out myself :)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 2/9/11, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] EVPmaker [7 Attachments]\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, RTSC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, February 9, 2011, 3:01 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Attachment(s) from Frank Sumption included below] \n&gt; \n&gt;  Think this can be more consistent than the box. I did ask this time--about 2012. Weird, usually they just ignore questions, or worse. &quot;Death from comet impact....&quot; I thnk is what it said. This stuff has a certain rythum, due to the chopped audio, it takes some getting used to, it helps to slow the playback too. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I&#39;m using an old audio editor called enounter2000, it saves the files in a smaller format, almost like mp3. So no conversion needed.\n&gt;  \n&gt; F-S\n&gt;"}
