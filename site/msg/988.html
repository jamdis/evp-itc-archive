Your welcome Laura. As to the other question you had about how to do it,  I updated my site a bit yesterday to add in the techniques I used including a short how to for the ST method I did. I just record with the pc mic and audacity but probably any way would work. Anyway have a look at the site and perhaps that will answer the question, if not let me know (I wasnt quite finished updating the techniques page LOL)
