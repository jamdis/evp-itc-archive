If you (or anyone else) have\ndifficulties to find a downloadable version of Cool Edit 2000, e-mail me.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Stefan,\n\n&gt; Do you know which versions do have the Play List? I can see if I can find an\n&gt; older demo that is available. I&#39;m not familar with Audition.

I will\n&gt;&gt; &gt; see if I can try that. Maybe when I get home, I will see if I can\n&gt;&gt; &gt; copy and paste the text that is supposed to be read to the group. If\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I can, anybody that can help in synthesizing the allophones to read\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the text, that would be a great help. To do that you have to have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Adobe Audition correct? Or is there anything else you can use/build?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Adobe Audition or Cool Edit. However, I have read that the newer\n&gt;&gt; versions of Audition don&#39;t have a Play List anymore. But instead of\n&gt;&gt; using the Play List, the individual allophones can also be combined by\n&gt;&gt; using &quot;copy and paste&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Stefan\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;"}
