Happy New Year Everyone!
 
I've finally managed some down time to listen to some of your  attachments.  
Frank, the first of your attached files -- A Chance to Talk  With This -- is 
pretty amazing in that it's so clear and appears to float on top  of the 
various snippets of sounds from the underlying radio scans.  In  EVP parlance, this 
is def a Class A.  Thanks for sharing!  I've worked  with DVRs in the past for 
EVP and am new to the boxes; therefore, it's good to  hear examples of what 
can be obtained from working with boxes. 
 
Sharon
