Ive been so busy with work myself I havent had \n&gt;much time to do anything lately.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Adding FM will be interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt;   I can hear that pretty clear and only difference I had was at the end I \n&gt;hear &quot;child princess&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           I&#39;m so busy withe boxes, I haven&#39;t had much time to mess with \n&gt;extra stuff. I\n&gt;just ordered some new chips last night so I can add FM as an additional\n&gt;sound source.\n&gt;\n&gt;There&#39;s a lot of darkside interaction, and if you start getting a workable\n&gt;system up and running you get those voices that try to either scare you \n&gt;off,\n&gt;or distract you from the real stuff. The darkheads don&#39;t want this stuff to\n&gt;work, preferring humans stay in fear, and fear of death is the most \n&gt;powerful\n&gt;fear to have. The manipulations can be very subtle. I don&#39;t want to get\n&gt;distracted on other systems till I have a PCB made, and a production system\n&gt;out there.\n&gt;I have an idea for a Spiricom like device using audio tones, instead of\n&gt;using radio as a sound source, I think I can adapt my system to it, using\n&gt;the random vlotage gnerator to sweep an audio VCO using the Intersil 8038\n&gt;chip. This voice was using a tone generator I had built into one of the\n&gt;receivers years ago, and mixed it with the radio noise.You can hear the \n&gt;1000\n&gt;hz sqaurewave tone in the background.\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________________\n&gt;Play Flexicon: the crossword game that feeds your brain.
