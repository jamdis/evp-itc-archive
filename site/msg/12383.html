Short .469 session yesterday, I ask=
ed if they could tell me my name.
Response I got was "your actual name?"

I=
 replied yes, my actual name and received "Andy....Mike"

My name is Andrew=
 Michael, and the response was almost immediate. The
file I posted was comp=
ressed for space saving, but from my initial
question I shaved several seco=
nds off between the 'yes my actual name'
and the 'andy...mike' . total clip=
 time before compression was about 10
seconds. Still pretty new at this, so=
 hearing my first and middle name
repeated back to me takes some getting us=
ed to, but very exciting. 

Thanks,
Andy
