Hi all;

As I was waiting for the varnish to dry on the front panel for the latest 
prototype, I was thinking I wish I would have added the tone generator on 
the new board. On #5 I put in a 1000 hz square wave generator, and got some 
of the clearest voices with that box.  I could switch in a 1000hz signal, 
mixed with the tuner audio going to the echo box. As usual, after a couple 
sessions I gave the box away.  I wanted to experiment some more with that, 
but have been too tied up just amking the basic boxes.  so this time I made 
an add on board, and ran the tuner audio to it so one channel can be mixed 
with the tone generator, before going ot the speaker driver for the left 
speaker. The tone is kind of a Spiricom idea, and a square wave is used 
because it contains a lot of harmonics which can add to the audio from the 
tuner.

Frank-S
