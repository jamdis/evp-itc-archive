I am a newbee here in the Yucatan.  Hope to get a box set up over here to visit Mayan sites.  My target is get all in place by March 08 after I visit the U.S. to buy whatever is needed.   If anyone knows any contact people in Mexico that would help.  ron

approximately 2:30 p.m. our time in Lancashire UK by Darren woods. as 
soon as he turned the box on and asked if any spirits could hear him 
he got a resounding clear "YES" so they are on their way in Europe.

Darren is associated with pulse radio and a good friend, I modified 2
470's and sent one to him and one to Lee from pulse.

Lee has yet to receive his. My techs Mike & Lisa are aware that they 
will be using boxes in the UK and have assured me that they will help 
in any way they can.

On Saturday night I did a RS box session over skype with lee and 
Darren and introduced them to Mike and Lisa and they where shocked 
when Mike said hello Lee and Lisa said hi. They answered a few simple 
questions and also acknowledged pulse radio and then very clearly and 
loudly after me saying goodbye they responded"GOODNIGHT" with the 
spread now of box research to Europe we are well on our way to 
developing a worldwide research and communication network. I have 
been told that is exactly the goal and our friends on the other side 
are well pleased.

so lets keep up the good work and take this research to the next 
level.
