Kind of off topic but.... Frank have you looked at the Ramsey signal magnet antenna. I bought one and use it for my SW receiver and it really reaches the stations in the noise. I wonder if you would be able to incorporate it into your system.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: .....then why do I feel guilty?

                 well, I'm still here. I try to more patient these days, and instead 
of arguing, I'd rather just go do my own thing, and the ones 
claiming to be experts can have it. 

Even after making the boxes since 2002, I have no idea how or why 
it works, I only know if you do certain things, "they" talk. I don't 
do investigations, and still think there is no haunting if no one 
living is there to see/experience it. Spirit is pretty much 
infinately more sophistcated than most imagine. As far as I can 
tell, all limitations are on this side of the veil. 

I get a little irritated when I make the boxes, yet someone else is 
going to tell me how it really works, especially when they 
themselves have no technical knowledge on any level.

For me, I enjoy the challenge of getting this stuff to work, and 
the voices are a joy to hear, but almost secondary. I work alone, 
and don't need the group's approval, so when someone is claiming to 
be the atuhority on this stuff, I don't care, I can just as easily 
quit the group and work by myself, which is pretty much what I 
prefer anyway. 

Mass production doesn't seem to come together, like I think it 
would if it was supposed to be, so I don't think that's a direction 
I want to pursue. I try to just provide the informatiin on what I do 
so others can dupicate it when possible.

I've had enough, these groups are pointless, and I'm tired of the 
BS. There is always these incessant arguements with those that seem 
to think they know better than anyone else. Maybe it's just me, and 
my over reactions, but at this point, I don't care, enough is 
enough. So ya want the group? I don't actually own it due to one of 
these idiotic arguements, but have at it, cuz I ain't playing this 
game anymore. I'll continue my own work, in my own time, and in my 
own way.
