Hi All;
 
 I met with Moon last night, and it was unbelievably positive, l=
ike coming home. I did not expect that. Not only that, his little blue box =
working like I wanted all the boxes since to work, but couldn't figure out =
how to it get back to that.
 
 The first step is to rework the RVG, random =
mode. I think that's part of it, and I think the rest is the operator. I'm =
not saying it has to be random, cuz linear clearly works, but I think there=
's conditions, or levels on the other side where the random mode is require=
d. I have made progress with the audio, making it louder, but the trade off=
 is shorter battery life. 
 
 I forget the model number, but the little RS =
round AM/FM radio is hackable, and usable on external sweep. Just checked r=
adioshack.com, it's the 12-820 arm band radio, it has the VT pin, and that =
is an analog voltage. Thanks to Steve for that!
 
  I re-checked the 12-470=
, and it does use digital pulses on the VT pin, but it's converted to an an=
alog voltage on the radio board, but---it uses 4 to 8 volts for FM, and 0 t=
o 8 volts for AM tuning, so I'd have to do some level shifting to use AM an=
d FM, as well as slowing the sweep to half speed on FM, since it's converin=
g half the range--I think. I think the older 12-470 is usable as is, since =
it does not have the annoying clicking.
