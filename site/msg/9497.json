They call me &quot;urkel&quot; all the time and call \nfrank &quot;Purple&quot;.  I even heard one of kristin&#39;s files say &quot;Nitsirk&quot;, \nwhich is her name backwards.  It&#39;s almost like they read these yahoo \ngroups too.  They also probably do that to get our attention, \nshouting out a nickname would catch most people off guard and make \nthem listen more.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David&quot; &lt;cycron@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok i posted my first really good RShack response.
