&gt;  Starts out &quot;next month the 17th&quot; Don&#x27;t know what that is, but I&#x27;ve heard it
&gt; several times in various recordings. But wait, this is AM, where&#x27;s the usual
&gt; interference? At 5 seconds &quot;Wait---Navy&quot;, maybe that has to do with the old
&gt; disaster.
&gt; 
&gt;  Oh crap! I forgot to ask for the scientfic aproval before posting.
&gt; Admittedly, I was being mean spirited on purpose, I&#x27;m not going to allow
&gt; some science dork to brow beat me into submission. I believe the home page
&gt; of EVP-ITC says something to the effect that we don&#x27;t follow science, this
&gt; is for sharing information, and using the cut and try method, see what
&gt; works. I know everyone hears different, and that&#x27;s ok, that does not
&gt; invalidate this stuff. My apologies for ruffling feathers.
