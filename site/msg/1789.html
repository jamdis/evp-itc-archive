<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce,

I actually listened to your files Bruce and they seem pretty clear 
that they are answering your questions.  The problem i&#x27;ve been 
fighting with is at what speed to set it at when it&#x27;s automatic to 
have people not say it&#x27;s just a radio DJ or part of a song.  I know 
the files are fast and are very fragmented, but there is no way to 
say it is the radio because of the speed.  You are correct in saying 
that it could be mistaken for words that our minds make up 
themselves.  I just post what i think i hear.  If i send it to 10 
people they probably would hear 10 different things or nothing at 
all.  That&#x27;s the problem with any EVP, if you listen to the files 
enough no matter how you record them, you may think you hear one 
thing and convince yourself of it.  While doubters will always say 
you are nuts for hearing that.  There are no EVP experts 
unfortunately to sift through all our files and decipher them for 
us, so we just have to post what we have and let the general public 
come up with there own answers.  I will try and slow it down a bit 
and see if that does make a difference.  I never really thought to 
do that, but now that you suggested it, it seems like a good idea to 
go that direction next.  I think your manual sweep files are great 
captures, but there is really no right and wrong way to do EVP&#x27;s in 
this experimental work.  It&#x27;s whatever you have the best outcome 
doing i guess and stick with that.

-Steve

&gt; hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I have been experimenting with the manual FM sweep method for a 
good 
&gt; two weeks and have gotten some amazing results, but I can&#x27;t help 
but 
&gt; wonder if the manual movement of the dial no matter how consistent 
you 
&gt; try to make it results in some lagging and getting caught on a 
full 
&gt; word or phrase that is coming from an actual broadcast. The 
majority of 
&gt; messages I have been getting are direct answers to questions or a 
&gt; phrase or sentence that is obviously put together by different 
bits and 
&gt; pieces of the FM signals. I would like to know what you think of 
the 
&gt; manual sweep versus the automatic, I know Steve does his research 
using 
&gt; the automatic FM sweep box and I have been working with the manual 
&gt; method. When I listen to Steve&#x27;s captures they seem to be very 
fast and 
&gt; that to me makes it harder to understand and gives the opportunity 
for 
&gt; mistaking the sound of a word. the manual method on the other hand 
is 
&gt; slower and may give the opportunity to catch a broadcast word or 
two 
&gt; like I said so the question is which one do you think is more 
reliable ?
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce
