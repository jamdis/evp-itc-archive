<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I figured i would do an introduction for those who don&#x27;t know about the 
program.  Sound Soap is a manual tuning method to an audio file.  It 
has a bar on the bottom that can be manually moved by the user with the 
mouse.  What i did today was experiment with Stefan&#x27;s Allophone file 
into the Sound Soap program and manual sweep the audible tones.  I 
think this may be the best files i ever got so far, please listen and 
let me know what you guys think.  These files were from a 3 min. 
session with minimal editing.  I&#x27;ve had this program for months and 
never used it, i think Bruce gave it to me.
