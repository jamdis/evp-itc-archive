<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I dunno, Frank. This all sounds sort of like Scientology (“In the  
course of bygone decades, of thousands of earthly years, beings  
interested in the human species meet to decide on the continuation of  
the project.&quot; “This is the seventh time that we accompany and guide  
you on your progress toward a free, wealthy and sane future in which  
humanity would have stripped off the chains of intolerance and cruelty 
—a future in which it will be able to establish a fruitful, endurable  
relationship with the Light, ethereal realms of existence.” Jeebus,  
L. Ron couldn&#x27;t have written it better in the OT3 materials), and it  
sure sounds like the foundation of a cult, which was what I always  
had the feeling that group was heading toward anyway, before they  
fractured. I watched it all transpire from a distance, and of course,  
the outsiders were only given the merest of clues what was occurring  
for initiated. When I finally did get to see some of the photographic  
&quot;evidence,&quot; I found it almost laughable. Wait--no, I actually did laugh.

I&#x27;m not commenting on the audio by Raudive and other &quot;technicians.&quot;   
Some of those Chosen Ones were getting something (like Sarah Estep),  
but my personal opinion is that the central figures were playing a  
lot of power and head games.

It may be just me, but statements like “We, The Seven of the Rainbow  
People, have decided to help and support the way chosen by you, in  
INIT,&quot; &quot;“Our and your opponents tried to prevent this by all means,&quot;  
and  &quot;(In recent) weeks, some of your best were cruelly hit by  
illnesses, diseases, and personal problems in order to keep them away  
from their valuable work,&quot; make all my alarms start ringing.

HMO, of course, and with all due respect, and just based on what I  
read and heard at the time and since,

&gt; Nice, interesting files, Bruce.
&gt;
&gt; You and FS (his post today) got me wondering about this time no more
&gt; thing...not to mention I heard similar statements of urgency over  
&gt; my RS
&gt; box set-up, too.
&gt;
&gt; Any more ideas regarding this, Bruce...FS.. .others? I personally
&gt; believe time to be illusion, and I also know it is written &quot;time will
&gt; be no more&quot; (biblical future prophecy).
&gt;
&gt; Still not sure where I fall with this, other than I do agree on this
&gt; urgency, elevating consciousness, etc

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here are some new Frank&#x27;s box files. You may find the ones about
&gt; sweep
&gt; &gt; rate interesting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There are quite a few good ones, New researchers please take note of
&gt; &gt; the different sound between Frank&#x27;s box and the RS boxes. The
&gt; operation
&gt; &gt; of the box and the sound and files it produces are very unique to
