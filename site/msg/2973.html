<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I believe it was a 13 tone generator. If I remember, one of the early
engineers behind the Moog synthesizer helped development of the Spiricom.

&gt; I forgot how many discrete tones were used in the Spiricom. IIRC, the
&gt; theory of operation was all of the tones and harmonics were combined
&gt; to create voices. The recorded output was somewhat hard for me to
&gt; understand due to all of those tones. Now what if the discrete tones
&gt; could somehow be filtered out of the output, allowing only processed
&gt; voice to pass through? I&#x27;m sure the circuitry would be very
&gt; complicated. This is probably just the Ny-Quil talking though.
&gt; Electronic engineering is beyond the scope of my knowledge.

&gt; &gt; That would be interesting, a hardware version of evp maker that would
&gt; &gt; sample the voice of a person speaking into a mic onto a memory chip.
&gt; &gt; Then slice,scramble, and play back that persons voice. It would be an
&gt; &gt; alternative to a tuner and to the RNG concept, which is also good. The
&gt; &gt; RNG idea Frank S proposed reminds me of Spiricom if you use tone
&gt; &gt; generators that mimic the human voice.
