<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Got letter(e-mail) from a world renowned EVP authority( name withheld cuz I
know the threats that would come), explaining how they tested the boxes and
found nothing to it, y&#x27;all just silly uninformed masses that don&#x27;t know any
better and they&#x27;ll tell us all what&#x27;s ok to hear and believe in! Thousands
of box users and experiencers are either lying or insane!

 Pseudo scientific BS! Their testing reveals exactly what they expectt, that
is the nature of the paranormal. Getting the results they wanted, they puff
out their chests and proclaim yet another victory for science!   Science has
a habit of supplying exactly the results wanted by whoever is paying for the
tests..

 First, where do they find people that are somehow qualified listeners!? WTF
is that S---!? It&#x27;s BS, and they know it. Same old skeptic/science crap,
except from a group that wants to be the worlds onlyest EVP authority.

 I&#x27;m sure there will be articles in major paranormal mags proclaiming how
the experts thoroughly debunked the boxes.

 They keep testing and getting nothing, and the rest of us keep recording
and have no shortage of voices that others can hear, can be validated, and
gives infromation that&#x27;s unknow to the listener. I just posted a video where
a voice says &quot;I said fuck&quot; just to show it&#x27;s not broadcast frags. This stuff
conveniently ignored.  I&#x27;ve been kicked off groups for getting voices thast
somehow were judged not ghostly enough, cuz all the experts know ghosts
can&#x27;t cuss, they can barely even talk and communcate!

 They send me their stupid results thinking I&#x27;m the one out there pushing
boxes. Ignorant dorks, it&#x27;s the results pushing boxes!
