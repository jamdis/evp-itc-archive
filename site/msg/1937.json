Seems to have \n&gt;worked, for now. Could it be in any way a technical fluke that you are not \n&gt;getting responses or are these email addresses that worked until recently.\n&gt;\n&gt;If you are being ignored, oh well you can&#39;t control the responses of the \n&gt;ignorant. With such a petty attitude they are not cut out for this type of \n&gt;&quot;bigger than myself&quot; research. I have had people comment on the &quot;spirits&quot; \n&gt;language in my recordings. Saying its negative and unnecassary! Some of my \n&gt;spirit friends may use bad language and speak in slang to make a point or \n&gt;just carry on a conversation but that is because I encourage the free \n&gt;flowing of information as long as it is progressive and positive. I still \n&gt;get significant information and good communications from them. They still \n&gt;have a helluva lot more insight than most of the living critics I run into \n&gt;from time to time.\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway, don&#39;t get off your path or distracted by this crap Frank. You have \n&gt;too much important work to do. I received a file for you the other day \n&gt;talking about spaceships again. They called you Sumption though and talked \n&gt;about shaving off your balls. Misty and I thought it was funny. Another \n&gt;attempt at making you more feminine...LOL\n&gt;\n&gt;Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank R.\n&gt;\n&gt;----- Original Message ----\n&gt;From: Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, August 23, 2007 3:20:55 PM\n&gt;Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] Curious!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             Hey Frank-R;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo marked your message as spam, and I can&#39;t go approve it from here at\n&gt;\n&gt;work. But anyway, I don&#39;t know if I should name names, in an attempt to be \n&gt;a\n&gt;\n&gt;nicer bitch. I don&#39;t get it, I made the damn things, gave them away free,\n&gt;\n&gt;yet I can&#39;t be trusted to fix it, or at least verify the box works for me. \n&gt;I\n&gt;\n&gt;think there may indeed be a limit, or at least a certain state of mind for\n&gt;\n&gt;users. So I guess these people are left with ugly little door stops? I \n&gt;tried\n&gt;\n&gt;to e-mail  but one e-mail came back, the other ignored,  so I&#39;m thinkin&#39;\n&gt;\n&gt;blocked maybe, which does not show they are anymore honest then the user\n&gt;\n&gt;they all hate------without naming names. BTW-Steve&#39;s not one of these\n&gt;\n&gt;people.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This probably sounds vague, but they know who they are, and I don&#39;t get a\n&gt;\n&gt;response any other way, so probably a mis-use of the group, sorta.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I didn&#39;t realize just how crappy car tuners were until I got the homebrew\n&gt;\n&gt;tuner working. I don&#39;t have anywhere near the static and noise in the HB\n&gt;\n&gt;tuner.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _\n&gt;\n&gt;A new home for Mom, no cleanup required.
