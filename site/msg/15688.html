 so much, Misty. I will see if I can ask them to speak as one, because I th=
ink you hit the nail right on the head -- I do hear them speaking over each=
 other, half in male, half in female, so maybe things would improve like yo=
u said if they organized into one collective voice. Can they still answer q=
uestions about individuals this way, or are you limited to generalized quer=
ies?

sible it takes a couple of sessions for the entity to master this new metho=
d of communication? For instance, I got my grandmother' s name (among other=
s) during Tuesday's session, but she said nothing, wouldn't answer our ques=
tions; Wednesday, she suddenly started talking and was the primary person w=
e communicated with, even correctly answered my mother's questions about he=
r childhood pets. Could this be because there's a learning curve involved w=
ith talking through the radio? Does it take a session or two before they "g=
