<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Familier voices are not uncommon in this type of recordings. I guess 
it is similar to what causes residuals, thats a good point Juli. -Bill

&gt; Bill,   
&gt;              I would also like to add that I have heard various 
colleagues voices through the box while doing a session.  I think the 
positive energy they also produce as a way of coming through.  I just 
recently heard Steve&#x27;s voice and laugh during an afternoon session 
and when asked if he in fact was also conducting a session at that 
time stated he was not.  I am wondering if we too leave a voice 
impression, such as they do with conventional EVP?  An imprint of 
sort, kinda like a stone recording or residual haunting?
&gt;    
&gt;   Just something to think about!

&gt;           Just because we project our thoughts into a Box session 
or even if we 
&gt; hear our thoughts in our own voice when playing back an evp it 
&gt; doesn&#x27;t make it any less real. I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s problematic, 
I 
&gt; think it&#x27;s getting closer to discovering what the origin of the 
&gt; phenomena is. It&#x27;s our own pk energy. Our devices may picking up 
our 
&gt; own psychic communication with the invisibles. -Bill

&gt; &gt; In working with LM3820, that&#x27;s the Delco radio chips I got form 
&gt; B.G. Micro at 12 cents each, I had the things working a while back 
on 
&gt; the breadbord, but the chips would not work when wired up on a 
&gt; circuit board. I drew the damn schematic wrong!!! I&#x27;m wiring a new 
&gt; board, and looking at the origninal schematic I had on -line, and 
I&#x27;m 
&gt; thinking what the f---, this ain&#x27;t right. I haven&#x27;t powered up the 
&gt; board yet, but it should work----this time.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I keep telling everyone you hear what you want to hear, or what 
&gt; the subconcious mind projects, even onto pre-recorded tapes! 
&gt; Listening last night to the tape I did Sunday night, and the Ol&#x27; 
Lady 
&gt; yells out that the mattress heater was not working, and the very 
next 
&gt; voice on the tape is about the matress heater not working! I doubt 
&gt; very much that anyone else would hear it, but that is the probelm 
&gt; with this stuff, few hear what others hear. Was the heater 
&gt; voice &quot;real&quot;--I can&#x27;t tell!! Maybe it&#x27;s a precongnitive voice--I 
&gt; can&#x27;t tell! I think we create some this stuff on the fly, which is 
&gt; very problematic for the research, but it has to be addressed.
