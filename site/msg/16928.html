Frank,

I listened carefully to the Rosetta Stone ad fragment you posted an=
d found it interesting.
The final word clearly comes from another source as=
 it is another voice. This suggests 
that what may be happening has more to=
 do with controlling the sequence rather than 
manipulating the audio direc=
tly. This was an interesting fragment since you know what 
to expect=A0as i=
t comes from a well-known source.

That observation leads me to wonder if t=
here are any other high-quality samples which 
would lead us to another con=
clusion. In other words, are there any good examples that
sound more like t=
here is=A0manipulation=A0of=A0intended words rather than=A0splicing?

For i=
nstance, let's say we knew a phrase was 'world's leading language software'=
. And 
we normally heard that phrase in a single voice. If we heard that ph=
rase with the last
word changed to 'hardware' in the same voice, that would=
 suggest actual phonetic 
manipulation. So=A0my question: is there any good=
 evidence of that sort of manipulation?

I keep using the phrase 'good evid=
ence' to mean high quality sound that is easily
understood without having t=
o strain one's ears. The sample you gave in this
case is for me a good exam=
ple of what I am calling good or high-quality evidence.
