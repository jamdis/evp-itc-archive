 I didn't read any resulting posts from what I posted earlier, and I'm not=

 ya can't go two weeks without someone that thinks they know more, or their=
 "theories" are more valid, or someone that believes for whatever reason th=
ey are the box/EVP/paranormal expert. I've had enough, these groups are poi=
ntless, and I'm tired of the BS. There is always these incessant arguements=
 with those that seem to think they know better than anyone else. Maybe it'=
s just me, and my over reactions, but at this point, I don't care, enough i=
s enough. So ya want the group? I don't actually own it due to one of these=
 idiotic arguements, but have at it, cuz I ain't playing this game anymore.=
 I'll continue my own work, in my own time, and in my own way.
