Thanks Frank
   
  I was accessing the group at work not my group emails. I started reading through the posts from the beginning WOW with over 7000 it may take me awhile to get caught up. I thought maybe because the files were old they werent still there but when I checked a newer one it said it wasnt attached. Boy I wish I could hear some of your older ones they sound so interesting.

  It's cuz at work I can't get to the group, so send the files as e-
mail attachments, so you'll only get it if you have the group e-mail 
turned on.
