Not really a vacation, but the school district closes \ndown for the holidays, plus the added snow days!! I have the two proto types \nboards complete, and funtional, at least as far as the individual sections \ngo, now to test them in sessions. I must be getting older, cuz this stuff \nseems to take me forever anymore.  I kept the shortwave converter, and I \nthink I have a version that works better. I think I&#39;ll order three more of \nthe micro boards, and combine those with home made radios to get some more \nsystems put together quicker.  I had three systems that I made using all \nsurface mount components, and they were the most stable systems so far, and \nthe most compact. I gave the first ones away, DOH!\n\n\nFrank\n\n\n&gt;From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Did demons kill John Lennon?
