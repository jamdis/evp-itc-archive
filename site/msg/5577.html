&gt;             I use Adobe as well.  Just try the scientific filter, 
then clip and pop reduction and amplify using 3 to 6 boost.  Don&#x27;t do 
too much more otherwise it will hurt your audio clip.  In addition, 
always save the original.
&gt;    
&gt;             If you want to go through a clip together a few times, 
please feel free to email me under separate cover and I will be more 
than happy to assist you.
&gt;    
&gt;             Looking forward to hearing your research!

&gt;           I uploaded my first Ghost Box recording to my EVP file 
today. I used 
&gt; the same process cleaning it up with Audobe Audition I use with my 
&gt; EVP&#x27;s but it seems to need more. Does anyone have Audobe Audition 
&gt; advice for cleaning up that radio static?
