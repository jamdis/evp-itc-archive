You can forinstance increase the volume or dynamics of\nan entire clip (includingthe experimenter&#39;s voice), filter or denoise\nit to make it clearer, butnot cut out individual pieces (supposed\n&quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP matchwith what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the\nunedited version should alwaysbe provided along with the edited\nversion.But that&#39;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to\nexpress, aswe should always be able to present our results to a\ncritical public.Stefan-- &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is\ninvolved for these files.&gt; After my question, i isolate the response\nsection and slow that &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually\nstart to hear the message &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple\nsections of just noise that &gt; don&#39;t belong and eliminate them from the\nmix.
