Maybe some people are to conceive ideas, others to \nbuild, some to find other ways to communicate, still more to be \ntalented in gleaning messages, while another group may have a use for \nthe device with ghosts, still another with enlightened spirits, \nanother with ETs, etc.  I could really conceive of even much more \nexamples than this.\n\nThat said, just maybe this forum is best expressed as a potpourri of \nideas, methods, roles, capabilities and more, all for the common \ngood.  In being such a place, those who need to hear the technical \nwill hear the technical; those who need to hear the spiritual, the \nspiritual, etc, etc. Can any one man&#39;s ideas/experiences really be \nthe &quot;only truth&quot; for whatever this device&#39;s purposes are?\n\nIn that spirit, the term &quot;research&quot; may have a different definition \nto each person.  To some it is scientific, to others, it may not be.  \nAre all here researchers?  I would suppose that&#39;s most probably not \nthe case. Does that make those here who are not researchers without \nvalue to the common good/goal, whatever that may be? I would think \nthat none of us can judge that, but what we can judge is whether or \nnot chatting with one another should be respectful or not.  I support \nall being kind to all, I guess, and not thinking that others might \nnot have a role in this thing. ;)\n\nLC \n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; LC,\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand where you are coming from in respect in speaking their \n&gt; opinion, however if i had to read yet another post of how great \n&gt; someone is when nobody is great in this i was going to be sick.  \n&gt; Arrogance and ego is very bad and that kind of mentality is Cancer \nto \n&gt; this research, i can share my opinion with the group but never tell \n&gt; anybody what to do.  I sit idly by and watch 200+ people get bad \n&gt; information on a daily basis, which hurts any good research.  The \n&gt; best way to go about what we are doing is to come up with our own \n&gt; theories and post them as examples for others to read.  We \nshouldn&#39;t \n&gt; have anybody dictate every aspect of this as fact.  If anybody can \n&gt; give information on box use it would be Frank, who nobody who owns \n&gt; boxes has listened to...myself included.  He knows how they work \nand \n&gt; offers a great amount of knowledge to this subject or else none of \nus \n&gt; would even be here.  This board has started to be a dictatorship of \n&gt; one persons opinion and if nobody listened...they were wrong.  And \nto \n&gt; me, that&#39;s wrong.  I started out with Joe&#39;s box and moved forward \nand \n&gt; nobody helped me in my path.  I since aquired other boxes and \ntaught \n&gt; myself them as well, which means it can be done.  People...do your \n&gt; own thing and get results the best way you can and learn from your \n&gt; mistakes, that&#39;s what i did.  And getting Bruce his first Joe&#39;s box \n&gt; and Frank&#39;s box and getting him started in box research, i somewhat \n&gt; feel responsible for what transpired on this board and i apologize \nto \n&gt; those involved.  Frank, i&#39;m sorry that another person has taken \nyour \n&gt; box and claimed to know all and not listening to what you adhere we \n&gt; do.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nuff Said,\n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With all due respect, I am going to put my 2 bits in on this.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I love the sharing of info, but have elected to post less and \n&gt; retire \n&gt; &gt; to reading more. :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That said, I must agree with Ann that the initial post, though \n&gt; &gt; perhaps posted to be humorous, came off as disrespectful (in my \n&gt; &gt; opinion as a reader looking in on this forum) not only to BH but \nto \n&gt; &gt; FS.
