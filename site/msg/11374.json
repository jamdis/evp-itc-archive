People have captured EVPs on all kinds of recorders.\n \n&gt; Also are there any risks of doing EVP in one&#39;s home? &gt;\n\nNo. In fact - that&#39;s what most of the early researchers did anyway. As \nfar as my research has shown - the first time a recorder was used in an \nalleged haunted location was in 1971 (the first EVP on a magnetic \nrecording was by Fathers Gemelli and Ernetti back in 1952 with the \nfirst organized EVP research performed by Attila Von Szalay and Raymond \nBayless in 1956...several years before Friedrich Jurgenson started his \nexperiments).\n\n&gt; Thanks! \n&gt; Angela\n&gt;"}
