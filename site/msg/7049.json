In fact, I believe research is being performed on us by the other side.  If not research then certainly a test.  \n   \n  I think back to a required reading in Lit I class many years ago.  Castaneda...Don Juan, On Optimism I believe it was titled.  The scene had Don Juan, a Shaman, working at a gas station pumping gas (remember those days), and a car pulls up filled with nuns, preachers, &quot;holy&quot; folks.  Don Juan then went into a some sort of verbally profane and abusive fit directed at the supposed holy ones.  Their &quot;cover&quot; was immediately stripped.  Their reaction very normal, very human, certainly NOT holy.   Maybe we are not as holy as we think.  \n   \n  I believe we all learn from the research being done here on us and I believe the testing and research done here by us is of value.  I also believe that all personality types are needed and all types should be invited and welcomed...lol RL \n  \nLC Duplatt &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote: \n          Steve, here are my thoughts.\n\nI understand your post clearly, but would also suggest that people \nhere have different roles in this...myself included.\n\nThough I hold in high regard Mr. F.S., you, and the many others here, \nI wonder if the individual roles vary for whatever purpose, be it \ngreater or not.

And getting Bruce his first Joe&#39;s box &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and Frank&#39;s box and getting him started in box research, i somewhat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; feel responsible for what transpired on this board and i apologize &lt;BR&gt;to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; those involved. Frank, i&#39;m sorry that another person has taken &lt;BR&gt;your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; box and claimed to know all and not listening to what you adhere we &lt;BR&gt;&gt; do.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nuff Said,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Steve H.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; With all due respect, I am going to put my 2 bits in on this. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I love the sharing of info, but have elected to post less and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; retire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to reading more. :)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; That said, I must agree with Ann that the initial post, though &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; perhaps posted to\n be humorous, came off as disrespectful (in my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; opinion as a reader looking in on this forum) not only to BH but &lt;BR&gt;to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; FS. BH does get animated at times, but he also brings some good &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; input in here, too. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; We need to learn how to get along and work together.
