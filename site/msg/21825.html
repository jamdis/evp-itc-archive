I think you're right, Frank. There are several ways for "them" to
communica=
te and it seems like sound is the easiest for them to
manipulate. I don't c=
laim to know for certain, but it seems that if you
give them any kind of au=
dio platform, they can manipulate the sound
waves as they like. I was playi=
ng with EVP Maker last weekend, and I had
created a file from a foreign lan=
guage learning file I found online. I
loaded it into EVP Maker and was play=
ing with it, and I decided to
record for a minute. After a few seconds, I h=
eard --out loud!--a man say
"I'm here!" as if he was standing right next to=
 me. However, it did not
appear on the recording, which is very frustrating=
.
I do sometimes get communication through what I call the "inner-ear"
meth=
od, where they put words in my ear (usually the left one), just like
puttin=
g a letter into an envelope. That could have been what it was.
I've been he=
aring more of that since I started paying more attention to
them, but I oft=
en get them when there is no sound at all. It's like
they're using the eard=
rum or something, or putting it in as a thought.
Anywho, I still have to re=
ad the EVP Maker manual a little more, because
I couldn't get it to work li=
ke I wanted. Do you use the manual sweep
option?
