<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ron,

I appreciate the warm greeting and the links.  I am somewhat familiar
with all of those products but I would rather try and build one
myself.  I&#x27;m an EE and it&#x27;s kind of a pride thing.  Plus, I can
explain the data better if I&#x27;m using a device I actually understand
and can poke and prod as needed.  So, I&#x27;d kind of like to have a
decent understanding of the equipment before I start to collect
samples.  I will look into the EVP software.  I was going to use
Audacity and some MATLAB tools we use on a regular basis, but that
might be faster.  I&#x27;ll try to answer any questions you might have
regarding signal processing or electromagnetic communications phenomena.

Anyway, thanks again for the introduction.  I look forward to seeing
all of your work.  

Regards,

Anna

&gt; Hi Anna I am normally not a greater for the group but I see
everyone is a bit slower than normal in responding to a new member.
Welcome. I am certain others can answer your technical questions
better than I so I will not attempt to here. Let me suggest that you
take a look at other alternatives that will allow you to begin doing
evp recordings yourself in a blink of the eye and with less than $50
invested. You can also explore a couple sites where good equipment is
available to buy off the shelf that will give evp results. Hereis
stuff you might find useful. You can always build your own as you
move along in the process. I am glad you are with us. I have some
technical questions you might be able to help research...like learning
about the frequencies of &quot;their&quot; transmission etc. but I ll save
that. Ron l

&gt; http://paranormalsystems.comRon Rickettshas a Mini Box II that has
all the bells a whistles you can want. Recommended even by Frank S. 
&gt;  
&gt; www.UFOGeek.com definitely check this out because Mike Coletta (a
member) shows you how to hack all the radio shack radios so they can
be used for EVP. They work fine and can cost less that $25. 
&gt;  
&gt; www.digitaldowsing. com ---Bill sells The ovilus, a portable
hand-held unit andthe Pucka computer based unit.Uses speakjet
computer generated sounds.
&gt; buy.
&gt; 
&gt; Then there isEVP Maker w/allophone file at
http://www.keyportparanormal. com/evpsoftware. html This I believe
is free to download to your computer and is a proven system for EVP. 
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps. Personally, I like the Radio Shack 125 as a
starter. Proven by many here. I have an Ovilus, Evpmaker and just
ordered the Mini Box II.Good luck. ron l

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Everyone!
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m new and I stumbled onto this group after doing some research
&gt; online into EVP. I consider myself to be a paranormal skeptic, but I
&gt; have heard some very interesting EVP evidence and would like to look
&gt; into it further. I joined this group because I am interested in
&gt; submitting EVP data to some rigorous scientific analysis. I&#x27;m an
&gt; electrical engineer and mainly work in the areas of signal processing
&gt; and communications so all of this is extremely interesting. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am interested in collecting some of my own data (at some point) by
&gt; building a ghost box based on Frank Sumption&#x27;s designs. I am working
&gt; from the &quot;Ghost Box Notebook&quot; from 2007, but I am having a hard time
&gt; getting started. Has anyone built one of these and are there any
&gt; parts lists or more complete schematics floating around? I would
&gt; appreciate any build help or advice any of you might have.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Anna
