Good file Nick!  I see the apple don't fall far from the tree!  It's funny my girls love when I do spirit communication as well.  My 10 daughter thinks they are my new friends!  She is always wanting to know if they can in fact see us because they always acknowledge here when she walks into the room.  I wonder if she as a unique energy about her?  What ever it is, she wants me to buy her a box of her own, too bad she is way too young.
