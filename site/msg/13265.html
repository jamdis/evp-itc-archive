<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Reading the posts from the last week as I do every sat morning it is my 
opinion that some of them have a very polite condescending tone to 
them.This group and the people in it have always been very helpful and 
a joy to do research with I hope it stays that way I would hate to see 
it become one of &quot;those&quot; boards if you know what I mean (my 1 cent had 
to do it).  so anyway
One productive idea that I saw from one of this weeks posts was to send 
the same file privitly to a few people and see what they hear in it. 
Unpromtide by file names or other posts about it. I have a couple files 
that I feel are pretty clear. So if you would like to volunteer just 
send me an email with your email adress and I will send you a file not 
too long but it will be unedited and in its original form.
I will not amplify it or edit or change it in anyway from its original. 
Those who recive the files do the same NO editing untill you render 
your opinion to me about it after that you can do what u like with it.
 Remember after listening email me DO NOT post what you hear on the 
board I will do that later when I have everyones opinion.
