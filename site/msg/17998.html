There is a good way to verify a file irrespective of its contents without 
revealing the contents.
This technique is used in the software distribution business to ensure files 
have not been
contaminated prior to or during a download.

What you do is make a 'digital hash' of the files contents. This renders a long 
hexadecimal
number which is reasonably unique and will change if the file or file contents 
are changed.

The experimenter can then take a picture for example, create the MD5 hash and 
send that
hash out as proof of the file's contents, without revealing the picture content 
in this case.

Later, once the picture is posted, anyone can run a similar hashing program 
against the
file to confirm they have the same file whose hash was posted by the 
experimenter 

originally. Hence you know what you see is a valid copy of the original (picture 
in this case).

The software is available free on the Internet. One example of many may be found 
at:
http://www.fileformat.info/tool/hash.htm

You don't even have to download it. Just click the browse button to open a file 
on your
computer and the program displays a large variety of hashes including the MD5 
hash.
This is one example of how this could be done.
