<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>&quot;Matrixing&quot; occurs when a signal is right in the noise level (or below 
it). When the signal to noise ratio is greater, it&#x27;s no longer matrixing 
and most people can hear/see the same thing without any hints.

Sometimes processing/filtering of signals buried in the noise (done 
simply with various programs on pictures, audio recordings, RF etc. 
without significantly altering the content) will reveal there is nothing 
or something there.

&gt; If 30 people listen to your EVP recording and they all (100%) hear exactly 
&gt; what you do, are they wrong? Matrixing perhaps? Are they coincidentally all 
&gt; &quot;interpreting&quot; what they hear? Does that make the recording real? Just a 
&gt; coincidence?
&gt;
&gt; If we all sit in a theater and watch the same movie, we might like it or not, 
&gt; form 100&#x27;s of different opinions about the movie, but the movie is still 
&gt; real.
&gt;
&gt; No matter what we do as researchers, there will always be someone to attempt 
&gt; to say what we do isn&#x27;t real.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve seen people experience paranormal activity, objects move and 5 other 
&gt; people besides them witness the same thing, the exact same thing, only later 
&gt; to hear them later make excuses for what they saw. So no matter what proof we 
&gt; present, there&#x27;s always someone around to poo poo it - usually a person who 
&gt; has never actually researched EVP/ITC themselves ever.
