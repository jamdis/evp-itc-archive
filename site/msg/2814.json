People all over the world =\r\nscream for proof but yet if you ask them they cannot define what criteria t=\r\nhey require for proof. Why? Because they are so brainwashed in our societie=\r\ns materialistic teachings they never expect to receive proof, so they don&#39;t=\r\n even bother to define such a criteria.Its amazing to me that a primarily s=\r\npiritual creature such as ourselves can deny our connections with that worl=\r\nd and the source. The connections we experience everyday and at all times i=\r\nn the form of dreams, random thoughts and inspirations are so easily taken =\r\nfor granted and written off as figments of imagination, trivial thoughts an=\r\nd meaningless aspirations. Even as a child I knew I was unique as was every=\r\n person on the face of the planet. I knew that their were as many perspecti=\r\nves of reality as their were people to have them and that each and every on=\r\ne of them were just as valid as the other no matter how outlandish it seeme=\r\nd to me.Acceptance was taught to me instead of beliefs. Beliefs can enhance=\r\n the truth but they are not in themselves true.More than I expected to writ=\r\ne but I feel it is still valid,Best regards,Frank R.\n----- Original Message=\r\n ----From: Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;To: evp-itc@yahoogroups=\r\n.comSent: Monday, November 5, 2007 1:03:02 PMSubject: RE: [EVP-ITC] Nothin&#39;=\r\n!\n\n I&#39;m not really discouraged except by other people&#39;s expectation, and us=\r\ne of the box.
