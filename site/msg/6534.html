Thanks Heather    Wi Fi...pretty close to Y5 or 5 Y...when you listen at 3 a.m. and are half asleep with a badly tuned radio and badly turned memory.   I checked your web site and it is a radio supposedly capable of dialing in hundreds of internet radio stations. This is something other than radio broadcast but it still leaves questions...can it work for EVP signals...if not, why not?  Maybe it is good with EVP maker to get the basic voices?  Can it be used at all to standardize signals?   I have no answers only questions.  Thanks for passing this on.   Ron L

  I'm a C2C listener although I miss the commericals since I usually can't make the broadcast time, so I download the podcasts. I *think* you might be talking about this:

  It has on the bottom on the page about listening to C2C so they may have had their commerical on the station.

  Subject: [EVP-ITC] 5Y radio?
  

    Recently I heard part of a commercial on C2C about a radio called 5Y or Y5 or something like that.  Anyway, the commercial was balleyhooing something about getting the best reception in the world on at least these five stations.   Then again, maybe I dreamed it.  But I do think it aired on coast 2 coast and probably is on that station alot.  I don't get C2C here on a regular basis.  Sooo, my question is, does anyone know about a special radio system...maybe it is satellite generated...and, how would that fit with our work.  Ron L
