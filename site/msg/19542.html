<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ursula,

I agree completely. For a hack, I have yet to find one that works better and
I have tried several.  It&#x27;s cheap and sounds good and the popcorn isn&#x27;t too
distracting.  This is the fallback hack.

On an investigation, I usually try to use one of the linear boxes I have (a
Minibox Plus, a Joe&#x27;s Box, and a Franks) for the first session.  If we do
subsequent sessions, it is usually on a hack because everyone in the group
is used to the hack sounds whereas the linear boxes require an ear that uses
them more frequently for real time conversation.  Several people in my group
use GB&#x27;s (5 total), but I am the only won with linear boxes.  So even though
we access to (arguably) better boxes for GBC, in a group situation the other
investigators (with a few exceptions) prefer the step sweep sound of the 125
because its what they know.

&gt; Hi guys.
&gt;
&gt; As some of you know, I work with the inimitable Stacey Jones in a
&gt; ghost hunting group called Central New York Ghost Hunters. We have a
&gt; TV show that plays throughout Central NY (accessible to over 1.5
&gt; million viewers total) called CNY Spirits.
&gt;
&gt; In this episode, which has been uploaded to youtube, you can see the
&gt; Minibox Plus on an investigation. It was used in tandem with a poker
&gt; game and garnered some amazing results. The Minibox was used in part
&gt; 2, and everyones favorite shack hack was used in part 3. To my
&gt; knowledge, this is the first time a Minibox has been used on
&gt; television. You will have to ignore what Stacey says about the
&gt; Minibox because she was dead wrong on most of her facts. I wish that
&gt; the producer had interviewed me so I could have explained it a helluva
&gt; lot better.
&gt;
&gt; If you are wondering, I am the goofy looking guy with the pony tail and
&gt; tattoos.
&gt;
&gt; You can check out pt 1 here:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anxfj8Dlrus&amp;feature=related
&gt;
&gt; This episode was a followup investigation to a prior one done about 6
&gt; weeks earlier. This earlier investigation yielded some amazing EVP&#x27;s
&gt; and flashlight responses. YOu can view pt 1 here:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey6uHks4aj4&amp;feature=related
&gt;
&gt; These are some of the clips from that session.
&gt;
&gt; The clip about &quot;pissing me off&quot; has become pretty famous because
&gt; Stacey uses it when she lectures at conferences. It is very
&gt; intriguing because it is her voice coming through the Hack while she
&gt; is sitting at the table. I have discussed this clip with a few of
&gt; you, and here it is a lot cleaner than in the video.
&gt;
&gt; The rest of the clips are from the poker session that were not in the
&gt; video. On the &quot;Holding a Five&quot; clip, Mike actually had a pair of
&gt; fives in his hand.
&gt;
