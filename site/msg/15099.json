Ive been researching this a lot and was overly excite=\r\nd to find a group that actually has frank posting in it.\n\nI&#39;m about to atte=\r\nmpt to make my first box ( well i have made the ufogeek radio shack hack, b=\r\nut that was too easy). I plan to try and make the one with a random voltage=\r\n generator that&#39;s plugged into the Radio Shack 499, and if I can do that su=\r\nccessfully, out to an echo-box before heading out.\n\nMy question to you all =\r\nis if you could point me in the right direction to get up to speed enough o=\r\nn circuits and electronics via a website or book. I have no experience doin=\r\ng this kind of stuff. But im a quick learner and really want to make this h=\r\nappen.\n\nThanks for the help everyone,\n\nGod Bless and Good Results to you al=\r\nl.\n\nDavid\n\n\n\r\n--0-558992717-1245034478=:99827\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1=\r\n2pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Which schematic are you using?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:=\r\n 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;PADDIN=\r\nG-LEFT: 5px; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; MARGIN: 5px 0px 5px 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff=\r\n 2px solid; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT fac=\r\ne=3DTahoma size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Fro=\r\nm:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; afterdarkdigital &lt;afterdarkdigital@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SP=\r\nAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\n&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Saturday, June 13, 2009=\r\n 7:42:13 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [EV=\r\nP-ITC] Beginner Going to attempt to make his first box.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Hello all,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks for having me apart of your ya=\r\nhoo group.
