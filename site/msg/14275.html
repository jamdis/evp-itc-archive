<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I for one am new at this...but doesn&#x27;t mean I take this field very lightly. I have recorded once (so far) in a Cemetery...and I took the whole idea &quot;seriously&quot;, and with RESPECT. I can say for a FACT--that the voices I receive are &quot;genuine&quot; and not audible before playback...that to me is more desirable (and credible) than some that take &quot;bits and pieces&quot; of a radio program to try and place the information into a &quot;question&quot; or &quot;answer&quot; then try and sell (my unique) way of reaching the unseen. And for the 2 weeks that I have been doing this...I seem to have gotten some amazing results with my &quot;recorder&quot; type technique.  I am getting playful spirits, sadness, needy voices, anger, laughter, my first name spoken, possibly contacted my mother twice (unless is a trickster spirit)...so to say &quot;someone&quot; does this in a form (that others don&#x27;t approve)?? None of us are experts yet...so we will look for ANYTHING to try and find the correct &quot;angle&quot; that works for us :) Even if it includes an old Cemetery or working off the &quot;Broadcast Band Radio Waves&quot; to shack up some type of sentence. I don&#x27;t know...who has more &quot;throw away&quot; audio?? I know ALL of my EVP is &quot;unique&quot;.....I for one have tried the &quot;radio&quot; type of EVP. I tried 2 Shack Mods...no joy here people. For me &quot;I saw it at face value&quot; after just a few minutes. I don&#x27;t mean to offend. But I didn&#x27;t step &quot;first&quot;. Now who can say (for certain) WHO has the better form? What ever gets us closer to ourselves, and our lost FRIEND&#x27;S. That&#x27;s ALL that matters man :) PS...I am a 46 year old male from Iowa. I have died and went to the tunnel (when I was 18)...was told &quot;not my time to go&quot; by a male voice that echoed (in the darkness). I have seen 3 UFO&#x27;s in V formation (during Heavens Gate) *2nd comet of that year (here in Iowa) I have seen 1 &quot;shadow&quot; person (take 1 step and vanish) touched a ghost (snuck up on it)...got a burn on tip of my finger where I reached out to touch top of it&#x27;s head (entity was small like child). I have developed 1 xray plate with my finger tips to make multiple white spots in the film-over 20 spots (naval medical officer was angry when he saw them) hahaha...he didn&#x27;t know I did it when his back was turned :) Lot&#x27;s of fun out here Guy&#x27;s (and GALS) let&#x27;s try and not point fingers now.....Knowbody should feel like they are singled out here...like I said &quot;none of us &quot;here&quot; have ALL the answers&quot;. So I&#x27;m not a total &quot;Newbie&quot;...but I will try a grace yard again someday. And I would hope that people will respect me as well as I...of those IN that Grave Yard. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;April Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@...&gt; wrote:

&gt; Maybe some ghost hunters assume this, but not us ghost hunters who take our field very seriously.

&gt;    It&#x27;s just an assumtption on most &quot;ghost hunters&quot; part that the dead would be where they died, or were burried, a Hollywoodism I think. I record in my basement.

&gt;     I have a question, why is it that people are always going to grave yards, why would any spirit or ghost want to hang around in a place of so much sadness, when they&#x27;ve got the whole universe to explore.  Why don&#x27;t they go to some fun places?
