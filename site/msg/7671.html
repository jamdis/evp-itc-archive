its not before LC, unfornately it is after they have gone missing or there is a wrongful death attached to their autospy report.  We have been able to get names of people who were named by the box and backed by police accounts.  This has allowed them to take a another look at the statements and requestion those to involved.  It's very little but, but has provided additional lines of questioning for authorities to pursue.

          Wow, Juli! I never thought of boxes being used this way, especially 
to try and find missing and abducted children/people, etc, BEFORE 
they are harmed. What a great idea to discreetly work with law 
enforcement behind the scenes to see if it is viable. ;)
