&gt; How much will it cost to fix your little dog?  Certainly we all can  
&gt; kick in a few bucks to help you; you&#x27;ve been more than generous  
&gt; with your sharing of your research  and  boxes.  Give us a figure  
&gt; and maybe some of us will help  Princess.

&gt;  It&#x27;s not a question of whether or not the break can be set, the  
&gt; question is &quot;How much money do you have?&quot; At this moment--I hate

&gt;
&gt; A trip to the vet will answer that question, usually most breaks  
&gt; can be set unless there is another underlying problem. It is a cute  
&gt; lil dog, sometimes they are very fragile bone structures because of  
&gt; breeding. There are a few small dogs that seem to have alot of  
&gt; problems with bad backs and breaking legs/feet.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think its proof to those who want it, and as for me...nobody is  
&gt; talking about me on the radio, or using my full name...so it  
&gt; definitely gets my attention when my name is being used in context  
&gt; with things that are going on around me or happening to people I know.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I dont need any proof, they just give it freely so I can share or  
&gt; in some cases not share with everyone.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I stopped lookin for proof right about the time this all started.  
&gt; My first evp was all that I needed to get me on this path. My  
&gt; mothers voice, so long after shes been passed, friends, relatives,  
&gt; or even perfect strangers who I had no clue about until I found out  
&gt; after the fact....way too many proofs have been freely given to me,  
&gt; and I never asked for one. Earl and Bob Cox, I think thats one of  
&gt; my favorite WOW moments, not knowing about Erland Babcock it was an  
&gt; easy misunderstanding. Luckily I make everything phonetic so it was  
&gt; easy to catch later. I have listened to others evp from him since  
&gt; then and I often STILL hear earl and bob cox. They have also given  
&gt; me names of workers on this side who I have bumped into later tho I  
&gt; usually put off contacting anyone they mention until I think the  
&gt; time is right. Usually it is just weird to find out its a REAL LIVE  
&gt; person and that they just happen to be in the EVP/ITC field.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I used to always assume when they say a name they are talking about  
&gt; spirits there. Or that if I get an ITC image its a spirit face.  
&gt; They proved thats a wrong assumption on several occasions. Probably  
&gt; the only time I ever asked for anything was while doing an itc  
&gt; session, after so many faces I just wanted them to show me  
&gt; something else, anything else, &quot;show me something different&quot; led to  
&gt; a few portraits of the living.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Sometimes they speak the truth, sometimes a wayward thought creeps  
&gt; threw that shouldnt (or just a creep)... as for the dog...take it  
&gt; to the vet and see what they can do then you will know more.

&gt;  When you get a voice that talks about a specific situation, does  
&gt; that prove something is talking that is not a broadcast fragment?  
&gt; We do have a dog with a broken leg, so it would seem outrageous to  
&gt; suggest the comment received about a dog and a break would be just  
&gt; a stray broadcast. I hate to have an animal suffer, but what a  
&gt; piece of evidence! This is what I mean  by judging content and  
&gt; context.
&gt;
&gt;  I don&#x27;t ask questions, I did not ask about the dog. I was only  
&gt; testing the #24 box, and announced, as usuall, that I was doing an  
&gt; EVP recording to test the box.
