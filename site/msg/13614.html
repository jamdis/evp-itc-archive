<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Jon,

April and I have only ever met through the AGS group, so I&#x27;ve lacked the opportunity to get led into too much trouble.  I&#x27;m up in western Illinois, very near Iowa.  If anyone in the group is going to the AGS conference in Decatur Illinois in June, I&#x27;ll be there with a bunch of investigating buddies from Mercer County Paranormal Investigations.

It&#x27;s good to meet you!

Barb

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Frank, Jon, and Everybody Else
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for letting me join.  I&#x27;m really looking forward to learning more about this approach to capturing EVPs. 
&gt; 
&gt; My visit here started with a discussion over at the American Ghost Society investigators&#x27; group with a question about the Ovilus (sp?), which I hadn&#x27;t heard of before.  A Yahoo search later and following assorted links, and here I am.
&gt; 
&gt; I learned about the Frank&#x27;s box last year at the AGS conference when Rosemary Ellen Guiley did a presentation about it.  I have the Radio Shack hack as described in Strange Frequencies.  My team has used it on a few occasions, including one where we feel we were getting valid responses through it.  We&#x27;ve still got a lot more experimenting to do.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the things that Rosemary emphasized was that repeated use of a Frank&#x27;s box in the same location can result in drawing in shadow people.  Frank, you have indicated that you use yours at home.  Does that mean that this hasn&#x27;t been your experience?
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, I don&#x27;t know how you feel about being a celebrity in our little universe, but it is a pleasure to meet you.
