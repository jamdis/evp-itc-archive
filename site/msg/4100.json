I&#39;d love to get you on my \nshow sometime... if that&#39;s okay with you.\nIt&#39;s at http://www.ghosttoghostpm.com\n\nLet me know what you think about being a guest.\nThanks!\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, juli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; yes I actually do.  Chris was in a band called cold moon, thus the \nname Chris Moon was born.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:          This is \njust a meaningless tidbit I thought I&#39;d share...\n&gt; \n&gt; While doing some internet reading this evening I came across a few \n&gt; articles which led me to think that Chris Moon may be a &quot;stage \nname&quot; \n&gt; for the person actually named, Chris Huff (Christopher Edward Huff \nto \n&gt; be exact). I see his daughters last name is Huff, and his fathers \nlast \n&gt; name is Huff... so why isn&#39;t his, Chris&#39;, last name Huff? Anyone \ngot \n&gt; the 411 on this a.k.a.?\n&gt; \n&gt; Here are the three articles I found:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://ghostofcoast.blogspot.com/2007/03/i-smell-another-scam-about-\nto-\n&gt; happen.html (See comment at end of article)\n&gt; \n&gt; \nhttp://www.mscd.edu/~themet/TheMetropolitan/06_07/Vol29_issue30/metros\npe\n&gt; ctive/haunting.html\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.masonhouseinn.com/Joy&#39;s%20Journal%202006_happenings.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                          \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private & \nconfidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is \naddressed to.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;   No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or \nforwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.\n&gt;"}
