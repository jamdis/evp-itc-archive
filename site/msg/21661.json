I can hear most of them very clearly.\n\nNice work!\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, I have some info from the peanut gallery, most is high pitched\nso\n&gt; many of you guys won&#39;t understand it, signing type angel files, I\ndidn&#39;t want\n&gt; to  believe how a mother could kill her own child, but it seems she\ndid the\n&gt; deed.  Seems from what the angels say, the grandma and mom Casey got\ninto a\n&gt;  fight, Casey was mad so when the parents were gone, she put the baby\ninto\n&gt; the  truck, and closed the lid, she may have been tied so she couldn&#39;t\nget\n&gt; out and or  druged.  In one of the files, you can hear Caylee crying\nfor her\n&gt; mama, she  stills asks for her mother, and the angels are saying, that\n&gt; &quot;Christ holds the  baby&quot;  I have lots of files now, there are but a\nfew.  I think\n&gt; the  spirit say, her mother will &quot;get life.&quot; sf\n&gt;"}
