<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ann, I can no longer access files within Yahoo groups but see them 
attached to the individual emails. Here&#x27;s what I see instead of the 
file download link on the forum:

&gt; Hey Frank and everyone--if you can both place things in folders and 
e- 
&gt; mail them that would be best for me, at least. It&#x27;s far easier for 
me  
&gt; to get to them if they come attached. Is anyone else unable to get  
&gt; the attachments if their group setting is on individual e-mails? I  
&gt; know it could be a pain in the --- to do both, and if a lot of 
people  
&gt; are having problems then I shouldn&#x27;t ask, but.... well, I&#x27;ll quite  
&gt; babbling now. ;)
