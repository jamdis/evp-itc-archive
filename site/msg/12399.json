Mai=\r\nn credit\nshould of course go to Frank though, he provided the main roadwork=\r\n and\ninspiration. My main concern design wise for this was to have a\nversio=\r\nn that was compartmentalized (&quot;plug and play&quot; if you will) so\nthat componen=\r\nts can be easily substituted for experimenting. Plus\nsomething lower powere=\r\nd to make it more portable, hence the idea to\nuse a low power speaker power=\r\ned by the input device, and a\ncorresponding hearing assistance device as th=\r\ne mic/amp to amp it up. \nOnce the lid is on, this thing is *loud* but clear=\r\n. In fact, I have\nthe amp set to min volume and its still a little to loud =\r\nto listen to\nwith headphones sometimes unless you play around with equalizi=\r\nng the\nvolume settings on the 820 and the speaker.\n\nI&#39;m also going to be ex=\r\nperimenting swapping out the 820 with an iPod\nshuffle containing a lengthy =\r\npre-recorded sound file of audio. 30\nsecond talk (maybe me reading the alph=\r\nabet or something), chopped up\nwith EVP-Maker, and then spliced out to repe=\r\nat for 30 minutes or so. \nI realize, as Frank stated previously, that they =\r\ncan effect sound\nanywhere including in a control sound like this as its bei=\r\nng recorded\nor mixed. But my concern is satisfying the &quot;skeptics&quot; out there=\r\n who,\nas you put it when you first joined the group, feel that using the\nra=\r\ndio input it &quot;would be hard to distinguish from coincidence&quot;. A\ncontrolled =\r\ninput that can be referred back to for comparison would\nsatisfy that qualif=\r\nication that keeps getting thrown up. \n\nMarty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom &lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; ,\n&quot;ourobouros2k2&quot; &lt;ourobouros2k2@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am loving this design.
