<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes; if it happened now it would be visible 500 years from now. If it
happened 500 years ago, it would be visible now.

However, there are people including Greg Hodowanec who have collected some
evidence that gravity waves are near instantaneous, and that if a supernova
occurred now, it could be detected now. Still, we wouldn&#x27;t SEE it for 500
years. And the equipment described by Hodowanec (which I&#x27;ve built) can&#x27;t
tell us WHERE the supernova occurred, just the fact it did.

&gt; Fiona,
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to butt in, but I&#x27;m curious. If this is happening 500 Light Years
&gt; away from us, doesn&#x27;t that mean it will be visible to us in 500 years? I
&gt; know that there is a delay with sound such as thunder, then the delay before
&gt; an individual hears it depending on how far they are from where the sound
&gt; originated. Wouldn&#x27;t it be the same with light?

&gt; &gt; Frank, you mentioned June 17th and 22nd... I&#x27;ll be watching the PEAR
&gt; project (RNG anomalies) anyway, but I think I&#x27;ve found what they&#x27;re talking
&gt; to you about:

&gt; &gt; Yes, that could be the biggest &amp; best lightshow, ever. Get your lawn
