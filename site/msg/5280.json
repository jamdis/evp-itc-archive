My guess is \nthat we hear predominantly male voices because they&#39;re more male \nradio announcers.  Therefore, does the entity who announces herself \nto you as Lisa come through with a male voice at times (because those \nare the voices that she gets most of the time to formulate a \nresponse)?  Please tell me if my reasoning here is way off base...\n\nThanks,\nSharon\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt;   File        : /*Bruce RS files_1-2-08/7B_WE DON&#39;T HAVE THE RIGHT \nSIGNAL FOR CONTROLING THAT.wav \n&gt;   Uploaded by : bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; \n&gt;   Description : 7B_WE DON&#39;T HAVE THE RIGHT SIGNAL FOR CONTROLING \nTHAT.wav \n&gt; \n&gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/%2ABruce%20RS%20files_1-\n2-08/7B_WE%20DON%27T%20HAVE%20THE%20RIGHT%20SIGNAL%20FOR%20CONTROLING%\n20THAT.wav \n&gt; \n&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; \nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htm\nlfiles\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;\n&gt;"}
