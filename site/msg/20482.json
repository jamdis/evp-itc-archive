What could that mean?  Is there any context\ninvolving or surrounding this recording that would account for that?\n\nI may be wrong.  It&#39;s your recording and it seems like we sometimes hear\ndifferent things for whatever reason...\n\nThank you.\n\nAdrienne\n\nOn Sat, Jan 29, 2011 at 10:23 AM, &lt;jadawanstell@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  [Attachment(s) &lt;#12dd25f951174750_TopText&gt; from jadawanstell@aol.comincluded below]\n&gt;\n&gt;  *Here is one I did back in October.
