There are lot&#39;s of web based \nresources with different suggestions on recording evp&#39;s but the #1 bit \nof advice is to make certain other people nearby are speaking. The mic \ncan be more sensitive than your ears and the recording is amplified so \ncontaminated evidence is always a concern. If you&#39;re recording with \nother folks make sure no one whispers, if they do announce out loud \nythe name of the person and announce that they whispered. EVP&#39;s often \nsound like a whisper and usually have a different accoustic quality, \nex: the room noise or echo sounds different.\n\nIf you don&#39;t have audio editing software check out &quot;Audacity&quot;. Just \nGoogle it, it&#39;s a free download. You&#39;ll want to transfer your files to \na computer and sometimes filter out hum but be careful not to over \nfilter. You can also cut down long recordings into reasonable sizes. \n\nAlthough, people have recorded EVP&#39;s in many different places, try \nlocations that you can connect with emotionally. This facilitates a \npossible psychic connection which some people theorize helps get \nsuccessful recordings.\n\nWe&#39;ll be listening , Bill\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jessie&quot; &lt;sweetpea1278@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am from Northern Michigan, and am interested in capturing EVPS. I\n&gt; have a digital recorder in which I have gotten a few my first try. But\n&gt; I would like to see what others say as far as ways to get the best\n&gt; results. So I am pretty new to this, but excited to try some\n&gt; experiments. Thanks, Jessie\n&gt;"}
