<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It sure was easy to hack, Bruce. Nick did it lickity-split. And it&#x27;s  
really quite a cool looking little radio, too. :)

&gt; Here&#x27;s an interesting one that Nick got on his first session with  
&gt; the RS 20-125 hack. I didn&#x27;t post it earlier because I didn&#x27;t think  
&gt; it was clear enough, but I offer it now anyway, since its the first  
&gt; real &quot;cosmic&quot; box communication we&#x27;ve gotten. It was not in  
&gt; response to any question. The file is slowed by about 40 percent. I  
&gt; believe it says, &quot;Look for life; look for death.&quot; The final word  
&gt; may be the name Kate. I&#x27;m not sure. It&#x27;s the first part that  
&gt; intrigues me.
