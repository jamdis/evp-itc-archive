<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Bruce .. It sounds like your communication is &quot;LIVE&quot; and mine 
is virtual &quot;LIVE&quot; using DC6.  I have heard the radio and my PA 
speak &quot;real-time&quot; but it&#x27;s only a word or two .. I wonder if I&#x27;m just 
recording evp?

&gt; Hi Debbie,
&gt;  
&gt; Yes I am most certainly getting and hearing messages, responses and 
answers in real time.
&gt; I do verbalize my sessions, I ask questions and answer questions 
they may ask.
&gt;  
&gt; When you ask a question give at least ten seconds before you ask 
the next question.
&gt; Our friends may not be able to catch the correct signal or radio 
fragment to answer
&gt; immediatelly. Listen carefully during the time after a question and 
if it is answered and the 
&gt; conditions are optimal, such as a good signal and strong response. 
you should hear the answer if not all 
&gt; part of it in real time.
&gt;  
&gt; most of the time we miss the real time communication due to the 
speed of the sweep of the ammount of clutter the signal
&gt; is producing. I work with only the AM band, I find it less crowded 
than FM and therefore easier to catch real time responses.
&gt;  
&gt; The yes, no and name responses are the easiest to hear real time. 
The main thing is to listen carefully for any words or 
&gt; phrases that pertain to the question you have asked. Also when you 
do hear a real time communication, immediatelly
&gt; repeat what was said. That gives varification when listening back 
to the recording that you did in fact hear it real time.
&gt;  
&gt; At first get yourself accustomed to listening for the simple yes, 
no answers and your ear will start to develop for seperating the 
&gt; spirit communication from the radio noise.
&gt;  
&gt; I hope this helps.
&gt;

&gt; Hi Bruce .. Are you speaking to the box and responding to &quot;real 
time&quot; answers or do you have to play it back to hear their answers? 
Just asking because I need to play my recordings back to hear 
responses ..Debbie--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday 
&lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Mike,&gt; &gt; I usually start with 
asking if they will please join me in a communication session. If you 
have a technician and or spirits that communicate&gt; with you on a 
regular basis, and know their names, greet them and thank them for 
their efforts in communicating and to please send any messages&gt; or 
respond to any question that you have, and you will do the same. Also 
ask that they block any negative energy or communication or spirits 
themselves &gt; from coming through the box. then proceed with the 
session.&gt; &gt; At the end I ask that any spirits that may have come 
through the open doorway the line of live communication may create, 
go back before the box is turned off.&gt; &gt; wait to here verbal 
conformation from the other side that it is clear to turn the box 
off. the responses I usually get are Clear, Good, Okay or words to 
that effect.&gt; &gt; I thank my friends for their efforts and say my 
goodbyes and announce that I am turning off the box. I turn it off 
and the session is done.&gt; &gt; Some researchers feel comfortable as I do 
saying a short protection prayer before a session and some do not 
believe it is necessary. the choice is yours.&gt; &gt; I have posted a 
short protection ritual in the file section of my other group, it is 
there if you need it.&gt; &gt; the link to the group is

Need some more advice from everyone, please&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all, and 
hope you all had a good Easter!&gt; &gt; I keep listening to everyone&#x27;s 
recordings and since they are clips of what you are doing, my 
question is how do each of you start a recording to even get these 
responses?&gt; &gt; I write procedures and education instruction, and I am 
missing this piece.&gt; &gt; So you pull out the radio&gt; You plug in the 
external speaker&gt; You turn the radio on&gt; Then set the recorder to 
record&gt; But how do you start the recording?&gt; &gt; I mean, do you start 
off by saying, &quot;hi everyone this is Bruce, or Kristn or Rhonda. Is 
anyone one there?&quot; Or do you start calling out names, or do you even 
pray the night before that you plan to turn the radio on at 9am on 
such and such a date, or is it when you turn it on they are waiting 
for you?&gt; &gt; Also lets say you turn the radio on, and a spirit says hi 
Rhonda!. From there what is your response? What types of questions do 
you ask? &gt; &gt; Is it more like a phone call to a family member, friend, 
or even just talking on a CB radio to truckers passing by trying to 
learn who they are etc.....&gt; &gt; I am trying to step out a method for 
myself and it is frustrating me that I dont have a plan when I turn 
that rradio and recorder on.&gt; &gt; Any guidance would be greatly 
appreciated!&gt; &gt; Mike Edwards Cary, NC&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Never miss a thing. Make
