Yeah definitely tone changes going on as we age. Even in the other speech by the end of it he sounds more like the evp voice than the booming start he had. I dunno. I didnt know the man so I could never say I spoke to Edison and I know it for a fact. However I will say that it is quite interesting and if he did choose to come thru to me I hope I did him justice with all I have to say or not say on the subject rofl.
   
  Definitely hear similarities, definitely was shocked that it matched the file i downloaded in wording...and if you have no tongue, teeth, throat, larnyx, vocal chords physically speaking then bravo for coming so close that someone who didnt know you has to take notice.
   
  My friends/family/mothers voice...aint no mistaking that.... Edison however well I will leave that one up to you guys. It made my "COOL!!" list tho LOL
   
  Especially since it was in the reverse as most of the good ones are for ST.

          Hey--Misty, look on the same site for the recording by Edison (way down at the end of the page) titled Edison reads Mary Had a Little Lamb in 1928. This is what I remember as sounding just like what you got and I still think it does.

    I decided to look up old recordings of the man to see what does he sound like as a live person. I didnt find much but I did manage to download one recording of harvey firestone introducing him and saying it was the first time he allowed his voice to be recorded. It was done in early 1900's.The stranger thing is the first words out of his mouth were the same as the evp "this is edison speaking"
   
  I made a little side by side comparison and tho it doesnt sound exact it is remarkably similar to his voice in the rest of the recording. Id upload that but its too big for an attachment. If anyone wants the link to download the whole thing http://cylindersontheweb.angelcities.com/rare_recordings.htm look for the "firestone" one from 1919 14 THOMAS EDISON introduced by HARVEY FIRESTONE - Let Us Not Forget 
   
  Heres the side by side of his voice and my evp for anyone whos curious.

      Just as an aside, Misty--I've heard recordings of Edison's voice and this struck me right away as a very similar one. Each time I listen to it, I feel more strongly that it could be him.   

  The third recording "We have conscious..." is equally as amazing.
  

  Wonderful stuff!

    Kinda freaky beacause it was so loud and clear and unexpected. Was a good session I had a few good ones come thru but not sure how others will hear them. Too many to post. This one however I think is loud and clear for most. Using the ST Method.
