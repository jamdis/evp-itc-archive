&gt; Maybe they just dont have a name. Some entities never were human or  
&gt; had &quot;names&quot;. I have had a few that others have given names or used  
&gt; terms for them.
&gt;
&gt; Just a thought.

&gt; Ann,
&gt;
&gt; From what I can discern from mike and Lisa&#x27;s communication  
&gt; regarding techs/guardians
&gt; is that a tech is assigned to a researcher here on earth based on  
&gt; their compatible energy and harmonic vibration.
&gt; That is not so easy to do, so every time you do a session there is  
&gt; a temp assigned for that particular session.
&gt;
&gt; Give it some more time and keep asking but I&#x27;m sure when you do get  
&gt; yours it will be a special relationship.
&gt;
&gt; In other words you have to kiss the exact right frog for him to  
&gt; turn into your prince aah or princess
&gt;
&gt; I will keep the subject open with mike and Lisa until I get a  
&gt; definitive answer or you do.

&gt; Hmmmm. That second bit gave me the creepies, I must say. What are  
&gt; your thoughts on that, Bruce? I hear Lisa&#x27;s name at least a dozen  
&gt; times each time I run a session, so I feel confident that she is  
&gt; there, so I feel confident that I&#x27;m not in the hands of someone I  
&gt; don&#x27;t want to be in. Maybe they are still auditioning for the role?
