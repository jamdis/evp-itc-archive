The only reason \n&gt; &gt; I  came\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back was because I did not have Frank&#39;s address, now I do, so If  I get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kicked off this list by anyone, so be it, but the reason I did  come\n&gt; &gt; back was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because Spirit were giving me Frank&#39;s full name I  thought it might be\n&gt; &gt; someone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he knew asking for him.

I have had two\n&gt; &gt; Frank&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes #&#39;s 12 and 29. #12 was  stolen from me by a low life that took\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of my  generosity. That is another story.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I still have Frank&#39;s box #29,  the reason you never hear files from\n&gt; &gt; me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; using\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that box  is because it literally &quot;Sucks!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Most if not all  Frank&#39;s boxes are inherently filled with static\n&gt; &gt; white\n&gt; &gt; &gt; noise\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; and that combined with a metal echo box and noise generator make  it\n&gt; &gt; very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difficult to hear anything let alone communication  which is\n&gt; &gt; difficult\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to hear from a quiet box  like the 125.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank&#39;s box has seen it&#39;s day and  served it&#39;s purpose in my opinion\n&gt; &gt; it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; antiquated and is no  where near the quality of even a small cheap\n&gt; &gt; RS\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 12-469\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  as far as clarity of communication.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank is  actually using the guts from RS hacks to build his boxes\n&gt; &gt; now so\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have a &quot;FRANKENBOX&quot; that is essentially an RS hack with noise  added\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of just buying an RS box and getting better  communication?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mind you this is only my opinion but  it is based on years of\n&gt; &gt; experience\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every box that  is or has been used. I currently have 14 different\n&gt; &gt; boxes\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to mention EVP maker and I have done extensive sessions  and\n&gt; &gt; research with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each and for my money you can give me a  20-125 every time, the\n&gt; &gt; Frank&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; box\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be retired  to the box museum where it belongs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am the only  person in this research that will come out and speak\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  truth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the Frank&#39;s box, there are many people now that have  them and\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person you will ever hear a file  from is Steve Hultay and sometimes\n&gt; &gt; Frank\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself, and Frank&#39;s  files are so rough you may hear 1 out of a\n&gt; &gt; hundred\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; files the  way he does due to the fact that he does not even take\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time  to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do a proper session he just turns the box on and records a  couple\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; minute\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using his CELL PHONE !\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank has his place in RTSC history due to his ALLEGED  invention\n&gt; &gt; off the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first ghost box and he deserves the respect  for his &quot;POSSIBLE&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accomplishment but to be revered as a god in  the box field NO not\n&gt; &gt; by me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyway.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I  use the words &quot;ALLEGED&quot; and &quot;POSSIBLE&quot; in terms of his being  the\n&gt; &gt; first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; create the ghost box due to some recent  information that has been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; brought to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my attention that  concerns an individual that created, built and\n&gt; &gt; used A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Radio  Sweeping Ghost Box in 1969.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am gathering  information and documentation now and will hopefully\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  able\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to dispel the myth of Frank sumption being the father of the  ghost\n&gt; &gt; Box\n&gt; &gt; &gt; soon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is to be  continued!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All is  possible, nothing is probable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ ---- ----\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ************ ************&lt;WBR&gt;**An  Excellent Credit Score is 750.
