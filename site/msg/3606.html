&gt;  That&#x27;s what mine did when I cut the green wire. So I patched that, flipped the board over so I could see which wire the mute was on, it was a blue wire, then miss counted, cut the worng wire again, patched that, then unsoldered the right one. You might make sure none of the pins shorted.

&gt; Hi All, Well, it took longer than 10 minutes to pull the Mute pin . . . or should I say, after moving it back &amp; forth a bit, it broke off! Oh, well, I got it off! Then after I put it all back together, I turned it on, and on AM (light comes on, but goes off, to see what station number it&#x27;s on), but for the most part, it still acts like a digtal AM/FM radio! Am I doing something wrong??? Hmmm? Help! 8-/ =Judy=

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Hi Frank &amp; All,  Hmmm?! I thought all one has to do was remove the Mute pin! Now, you say I&#x27;ve got to look at the revese side from where the pin was and cut(!?) or undo (somehow) a wire that that pin connects to?  If I do all this the right way, how does the radio work/sound,then?  I&#x27;m confused, at this point. I also can plug in external, but small, speakers rather than use the earbuds.  =Judy= P.S. How can I tell if a pin has shorted??       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</pre>
