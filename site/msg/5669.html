From my perspective your first sentence is key in summing up the 
various viewpoints from people...the word &quot;believe&quot; stands out.  You 
posted, &quot;I&#x27;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I 
absolutely BELIEVE in the power of prayer, the power of positivity, 
and the power of ritual.&quot;  

Belief...  I think whatever works to keep a person from fear is the 
ticket. Fear is when we hand power over to something else and become 
its slave. Your post states that you &quot;absolutely believe&quot; - that is 
your power, mentally used by you to not succumb to fear, and thus 
remain in control. ;)

I might further point out that there is something more powerful than 
belief in my opinion, and that has been the reason behind my 
pursuits.  I suggest that what a person KNOWS as truth is even better 
than belief.  Truth is eternal and has no opposite.

&gt; I&#x27;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I absolutely 
believe in the power of prayer, the power of positivity, and the 
power of ritual.  When I first started recording EVP a couple of 
years ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when it 
happened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or distressed.  I 
will ask again:  What physical or psychic harm is a disembodied 
entity capable of doing?  Please listen to the one EVP I&#x27;ve posted on 
this board and tell me what, if anything, you hear.  I know what I 
hear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is the 
response that has created the determination in me to continue 
researching the unknown.  
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings.  I only want to learn as 
much as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on this 
board.  It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in the 
past, and that&#x27;s about all I can say.  I will probably use one from 
this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract 
goodness.  
&gt; 
&gt; So, thank you for this contribution.  I think the debate has been 
an excellent one, and I&#x27;ve appreciated the opportunity to be 
enlightened.

&gt;   Subject: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   I swore I would not get wraped up in this debate
&gt; 
&gt;   BUT!
&gt; 
&gt;   The reason I came up with this whole protection ritual was that 
some 
&gt;   of the new researchers where
&gt; 
&gt;   expressing a rational concern for negative responces that they 
were 
&gt;   recieving through thier boxes.
&gt; 
&gt;   The short protection ritual that I posted is not meant to quell 
&gt;   irrational histerical fear, and I agree
&gt; 
&gt;   with rosemary that anyone suffering from such fear should rethink 
&gt;   thier involment in the paranormal research field.
&gt; 
&gt;   that being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal 
comfort 
&gt;   to those new individuals that had never 
&gt; 
&gt;   expperienced spiritual negativity. And to help ease them into 
&gt;   aproaching a session eventually with confidence
&gt; 
&gt;   and determination as well as full curiousity for all types of the 
&gt;   communication we recieve.
&gt; 
&gt;   My initial post of the ritual file was done with the best of 
&gt;   intentions and meant to be another tool available for those who 
felt 
&gt; 
&gt;   they needed or wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent 
prayer 
&gt;   ritual, I don&#x27;t think it is really worthy of all this debate.
&gt; 
&gt;   Use it, don&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s there if you want it. Also I must say 
&gt;   there are two kinds of fear the kind that is natural and a god 
&gt; 
&gt;   given emotion for self preservation, ie the fright and flight 
reflex 
&gt;   that is an instinctive trait in all of us. Then you have the 
&gt; 
&gt;   irrational dibilitating phobic fear that can turn an individual 
into 
&gt;   a frozen statue. That type of fear I believe is unhealthy
&gt; 
&gt;   and should be addressed and dealt with and learned how to 
harness. I 
&gt;   also believe that anyone that harbors that type of fear 
&gt; 
&gt;   would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a case of such 
&gt;   fear it would already be present and doing a small protection 
&gt; 
&gt;   ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take it for what it 
is, 
&gt;   something to utilize in our box of tools like an emf meter.
&gt; 
&gt;   you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the bottom of your 
tool 
&gt;   box at home that you inherited from your grandfather and have 
never 
&gt;   used
&gt; 
&gt;   but if you come across that odd nut that needs tightening somedsy 
you 
&gt;   will be glad you have it.
