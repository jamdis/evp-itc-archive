<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have to admit that when I was telling someone that you didn&#x27;t want 
to be involved in the &quot;Ghost Hunting aspect of paranormal research&quot; 
it seemed odd to me to be saying that.   There are many of us who are 
into investigating the paranormal for the same reasons as you, the 
need to know more, not for the thrill of it.  I think what you really 
mean is that you don&#x27;t wish to associate with thrill seekers.  

I can also understand your not wanting to use the box for personal 
readings.  I know the box was used at the convention in GA for people 
to contact loved ones.  Of course we&#x27;d all like to speak with our 
loved ones, but I understand your feelings.  

When we used it here in NY, we were speaking with people who were 
telling us about the location we were at, things we didn&#x27;t know and 
confirming things that the director thought, but didn&#x27;t have proof 
of.  I do agree though that you don&#x27;t have to be at a supposed 
haunted place to get the same information!

I&#x27;m sorry to hear that you won&#x27;t work with HTM anymore, but I 
understand and respect that decision!

and how 
&gt; they go about digging for the evidence, and the various &quot;jobs&quot; each 
does. It 
&gt; occured to me that I ghost hunter was exactly the same, and I 
should be alot 
&gt; more tolerant of theses other elevel of investigation. Anyone that 
has known 
&gt; me for  awhile probably knows I can be dense!
