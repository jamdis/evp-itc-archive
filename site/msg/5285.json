I believe they try to answer \nin the apropriate gender so that I \n&gt; don&#39;t get confused about who is answering. Sometimes I will get a \nresponse or message that is made \n&gt; up of both male and female voices together, even in the same word \nsometimes but very rarely.\n&gt;  \n&gt; And I think when that occurs it&#39;s because they lose the particular \nfragment midstream and pick up \n&gt; whatever is available at that instant to complete the message , \nword or phrase.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I hope this answers your question and please keep asking them. It \nforces me to formulate an answer\n&gt; and you to further your knowledge as a researcher. That&#39;s what it&#39;s \nall about.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: leongbabe@...: Fri, 11 Jan 2008 16:26:18 \n+0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Male and female voices joined to create one \nresponse?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce,Is it common to receive a response comprised of a mixture of \nmen and women sound bytes/voices (like I heard in this one)? My guess \nis that we hear predominantly male voices because they&#39;re more male \nradio announcers. Therefore, does the entity who announces herself to \nyou as Lisa come through with a male voice at times (because those \nare the voices that she gets most of the time to formulate a \nresponse)? Please tell me if my reasoning here is way off \nbase...Thanks,Sharon--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Hello,&gt; &gt; This email message is a \nnotification to let you know that&gt; a file has been uploaded to the \nFiles area of the EVP-ITC &gt; group.&gt; &gt; File : /*Bruce RS files_1-2-\n08/7B_WE DON&#39;T HAVE THE RIGHT SIGNAL FOR CONTROLING THAT.wav &gt; \nUploaded by : bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; &gt; Description : \n7B_WE DON&#39;T HAVE THE RIGHT SIGNAL FOR CONTROLING THAT.wav &gt; &gt; You can \naccess this file at the URL:&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-\nITC/files/%2ABruce%20RS%20files_1-2-08/7B_WE%20DON%27T%20HAVE%20THE%\n20RIGHT%20SIGNAL%20FOR%20CONTROLING%20THAT.wav &gt; &gt; To learn more \nabout file sharing for your group, please visit:&gt; \nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htm\nlfiles&gt; &gt; Regards,&gt; &gt; bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get the power of Windows + Web with the new Windows Live.\n&gt; http://www.windowslive.com?\nocid=TXT_TAGHM_Wave2_powerofwindows_012008\n&gt;"}
