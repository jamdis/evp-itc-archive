<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, I am. I try to stay objective and I&#x27;ve read your past e-mails and
honestly, I think a lot of people are reading things into what you post that
I do not see. I do not understand the hostility that is being flung at you.
People are misunderstanding you tremendously for some reason.

This does not bode well ...

&gt;   I can see you&#x27;re not in favor of this suggestion for a more peaceful
&gt; group, though I don&#x27;t understand why,
&gt;
&gt; Is anyone else with me on this?

&gt; that would be fine, if you didn&#x27;t piss Frank off....... But you do.....
&gt; AND THAT IS NOT OKAY.....
&gt; The same thing will happen when you do it again....
&gt; So what&#x27;s the point in you being here.

&gt; I expect none of us like all the recent attacks, insults, accusations,
&gt; threats, hurting of feelings, and attempts to piss people off.
&gt;
&gt; Can I suggest we stick to the purpose of the group: &quot;the discussion,
&gt; promotion, and developemnt of Electronic Voice Phenomenon, and Instrumental
&gt; Transcommunication methods and technologies as used in the communication
&gt; with spirit, and other entities.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; And that we go with Frank&#x27;s philosophy &quot;just take the approach, try
&gt; different methods, see what works.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; No more threats. No name calling, insults, or accusations. Just try to keep
&gt; a positive group attitude, be open that not everyone believes what everyone
&gt; else does, and that&#x27;s ok?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;

Yes, I am. I y o s ay objec i e and I&#x27; e ead you pas e-mails and hones ly, I hink a lo o people a e eading hings in o wha you pos ha I do no see. I do no unde s and he hos ili y ha is being lung a you. People a e misunde s anding you emendously o some eason.
