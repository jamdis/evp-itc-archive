No I don't have a spirit box, a Franks Box or anything like that.=C2=A0 And=
 no, I do not want one.

I have=C2=A0been involved with=C2=A0this research =
a long time, been a paranormal researcher for a long time, with ten years o=
f real investigative work under my belt to boot.

I am not cutting anyone d=
own at the knees here, not insulting anyones work or personal beliefs.=C2=
=A0 

But this onslaught of betterment against logical thought and question=
ing is a bit troubling, do you not think?=C2=A0 Can we not hear both sides?=
=C2=A0 

Not every Skeptic is out to get you!=C2=A0 But you might be asked =
a few=C2=A0 questions.=C2=A0 And in the long run of things,=C2=A0what is wi=
ll be.=C2=A0 There is no one "OUT TO GET YOU"

That is not the nature of di=
scovery=C2=A0or of Science.=C2=A0 If, people are talking to dead people wit=
h (Effectively) broken radios, lets see the facts and analyze it.=C2=A0 Let=
's test it! Let's get to the bottom of it.

Let us=C2=A0really, really look=
 at it.

If anything like that was ever able to be proven as a solid Scient=
ific principle or fact, it would be monumental.=C2=A0 It would be Earth sha=
ttering and completely change how we=C2=A0view logic and science as we know=
 it.

So if this is real, lets look at it.=C2=A0Lets try and be objective a=
bout it?

What is wrong with that?

=C2=A0"Nature is showing us only the ta=
il of the lion, but I have no doubt that the lion belongs to it even though=
, because of its large size, it cannot totally reveal itself all at once." =

<DIV> I =
know what it is, even though I can't even spell it or pronounce it. It's wh=

<DIV> I have gotten "voices" that I thought were perfectly=
 clear, and no one else could hear it, and some I found was just&=
nbsp;a snippet of music, so yeah, that happens, but it does not eliminate o=
r explain everything from the boxes, and other EVP methods, you  just =
have to be aware of the possibility. Anotherr problem is broadcast fragment=
s, sometimes they are just what they sound like, an ad for one thing or ano=
ther, sometimes they can have sychronistic meaning, and sometimes they=
 can be altered in some way to form a messages, such as the recent one I ha=
d about learning sex, which was seemingly ignored by all cuz it has the "s"=
 word--I guess. The fragments can also be distorted as the radio tuning is =
swept across a station, I don't accept every word and syllable as meaning s=
omething. You have tio judge mnessage by content and personal meaning. </DI=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> I have seen faces stand up in a carpet righ=
t in front of me, not something I just happened across, something that happ=
ened live as I watched. For someone to suggest that's imagination I find ve=
ry offensive.  </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> When I first switch=
ed to a linear sweep in the boxes, I could hear nothing but gibberish, then=
 suddenly I could hear "them" speaking. I doubt that is all imagi=
nation either, I think the mind(which is not brain) has to reprogram the ea=
rs, which are brain, to hear.  I also think the skeptics can not allow=
 this programming to take place, hence they can't hear. I would be very sur=
prised if any of the hard core skeptics even turned on a box for fear that =
they may hear something that's not there. Rorke(the Phd) implied as much wh=
en he wanted a box to test, or more like debunk. That crap is frikkin'=
 pathetic!</DIV>

<DIV> It was impli=

names, and the names of deseased loved ones through EVP, as well as questio=
