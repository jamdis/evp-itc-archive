Essentially, we are in agreement and share a similar moral \nphilosophy, despite my posts defending the rights of others to take advantage of the \nmarket (even if I don&#39;t like it).  ;-)\n\nMy main concern, and difference of opinion, is with your assertion, Bruce, that these units \n(sold by price gouging people - no disagreement there) will come with the &quot;wrong energy \nattached to them.&quot;  I&#39;m perfectly happy to agree to disagree on this aspect of the topic at \nhand, and I think others are perfectly capable of making up their own minds on what they \nthink, now that different points of view are on the table for consideration.\n\nThere are some people who are very black and white when it comes to the topic of making \nmoney in the paranormal field.  This is why I posed the questions to you both about Ron \nand shared the story of my friend.  I am not one of the people in the black and white \ncamp.  Jeremy, it appears that you are, and you are not alone, that&#39;s for sure.  I believe in \npeople&#39;s right to profit in the field, but I absolutely wish to see it be done in a fair and \nhonorable manner.  That being said, I also have respect for those in the black and white \ncamp, and I can even understand where you are coming from.\n\nI don&#39;t know Ron personally, but I can tell you in another forum when the erroneous \nassumption was made that he was price gouging, I similarly stated my views about his \nright to profit from the sale of a quality product, which performs as stated.  I understand \nit&#39;s not much profit, as he does specify on his site that he sells these units for &quot;close to \nactual cost&quot; (so Bruce, I&#39;m not under the same impression he is selling at a loss.)  As well, \nhe states that the soon to be released MaxiBox will be intended for the experienced users, \nand the MiniBox will remain in production as the standard system, implying it is an entry \nlevel unit.  Hopefully, as is often the case, production costs can eventually be reduced.\n\nSimilarly, I do not know Chris.  If he is, as I&#39;ve read others claim - &quot;less than&quot; he presents \nhimself to be, and falls short in terms of services offered - than certainly his practices \nwould fall somewhere near, or even well within, the realm of charlatanism and I have \nalready expressed my distain for this type of behavior.  \n\nMy closing wish is this:  May those who are interested in obtaining a commercially \navailable &#39;ghost box&#39; (of whatever flavor), be blessed with one coming into their lives, \neither by gift or by purchasing one at a fair price.  \n\nThanks for the discussion, guys.  I appreciate it.  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ron Is a friend and these comments where not directed toward him.\n&gt; I also own a mini box and am happy with it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The difference is, when the minibox was introduced for sale at 399.00 which is what I \npaid.\n&gt; You could not obtain one any cheaper and Ron was not trying to exploit the needs and \ndesires of &quot;new&quot; researchers\n&gt; in the field. If I&#39;m not mistaken he has repeatedly said that the minibox was primarily \nmeant for experienced researchers and \n&gt; paranormal investigating teams. And I believe he actually took a loss on the minibox.\n&gt;  \n&gt; On the other hand what you have on ebay are unscrupulous individuals who see that \nthey can pick up an item for 24.99\n&gt; open it and cut a wire which takes about ten seconds from beginning to end. and then \ndouble the price plus shipping.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There is a name for it, I believe it is PRICE GOUGING when there is a short or none \nexistent supply of something and \n&gt; there are people or companies that hold some pieces of the product and sell it at \ninflated prices to unwary individuals that feel a need to have it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In my book they are no more than thieves without guns. And should never be patronised \nno matter what the circumstances.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: ITCdeadpeople@...: Sat, 5 Apr 2008 16:13:04 +0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] \nRe: boxes on ebay\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Bruce. That&#39;s wonderful your are in a financial position to be so generous. :-) I don&#39;t \nknow if we can really go so far as to say that people who buy from eBay are receiving units \nwith the wrong kind of energy attached, just because profiting from sales isn&#39;t a course of \naction you or I, nor some others would take. If that is the case, where do we draw the line? \nI paid a hefty price for my MiniBox, as have many others. I&#39;m sure there is some profit \ninvolved there. The energy of it seems just fine to me and I hold no disregard toward Ron \nfor recognizing there is a market for his devices.Perhaps those who log onto eBay looking \nto find something so they can experiment with automated sweep feel it&#39;s their lucky day \nwhen they discover such a listing? Maybe they even feel it&#39;s a &#39;sign&#39; that it&#39;s the right thing \nfor them to do some research. And as far as the seller is concerned, we don&#39;t know what \ntheir attitude or motivation is, unless we know them personally. Reminds me of a person \non the cleaning crew who used to steal the food from the fridge at one of my corporate \njobs. Everyone was so harsh and judgmental about it, until one day, we learned she was \nfeeding her hungry children!Even if the person selling the units is the most greedy person \nin the world, I fully believe it is far more the attitude and intention of the person \nconducting the experiments which influence the energy of communication devices, than \nthe attitude of the people selling the devices. It&#39;s my opinion WE are the ones who attract \nwhat comes through to us on our equipment, much more so than the equipment itself. \nMargaret--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; \nwrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Guy&#39;s&gt; &gt; Do not give in to these demons that are trying to make a buck from \nthe research we love and the equipment we use.&gt; &gt; I have given away including the \nshipping 5 RS boxes for free, 4, 470&#39;s and 1 469 all hacked by me.&gt; I did not do it to gain \npopularity or even wanted a thank you. my sole motivation was to bring new people into \nthe research and &gt; in turn change someones life and perpetuate the idea of strength in \nnumbers, in this case strength of communication.&gt; &gt; To all new people on this board, do \nnot patronise these wolves that prey on the needs and wants of others. &gt; The RS 20 -125 \nis everything the 470 & 469 are and a little more. do not let the size or complicated button \narrangement scare you off.&gt; the hack is as simple as the others. &gt; &gt; Do not buy any RS \nhacks from ebay, they are sold with the wrong energy attached to them, spirit wise.&gt; That \nis why I and all other researchers should follow the example of a great man to whom we \nowe all of this research.&gt; Mr. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to make \na substantial amount of money from his boxes and&gt; was offered the opportunity on a \nsilver platter. But chose to follow what had been asked of him by higher entities.&gt; And \nthat was to keep the research pure for research sake. And that at no time was this \nequipment or knowledge there of&gt; to be for monetary gain.&gt; &gt; I adhere to this promise \nmade by Frank to our friends on the other side and feel that there is no need to give in to \nthese box &gt; extortionists. If a box is not attainable for a new person yet, the right way. \nThen it probably is not their time yet.&gt; &gt; I have coined a phrase and believe in it. &quot;The \nresearcher does not choose the box, the box chooses the researcher&quot;&gt; Be patient, those \nthat do not yet have a box. We will do all we can to help you obtain one.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; Bruce \nHalliday &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: reesclarke_69@: Fri, 4 Apr 2008 18:49:09 -0700Subject: \nRe: [EVP-ITC] Re: Few more traditional evp&#39;s&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No bodies at fault, but I would do \nthe hack just to help more people get in this field.
