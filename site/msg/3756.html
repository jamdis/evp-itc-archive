 Interesting. This is the "eveidence" I usaully don't get to see and hear.=
 All I usually hear is someone saying how every other researcher in the wor=
ld gets nothing, he is the only one that gets the valid communucation, whic=
h personally I find highly insulting. 
 
 One fact is, I did not make a "te=
lephone to dead", I don't know what the f--- that is, and I don't endorse i=
t! Nor do I appreciate my name being connected to the so called "Telephone =
to dead" on every friggin' ad for Moon's public appearances. I just make th=
e boxes, I'm not someone's lacky.
