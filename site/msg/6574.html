&gt; Over last weekend the owner of a famous Illinois haunted location  
&gt; (the release of the movie is not due out until later this year).   
&gt; The owner requested that my organization bring the box to the  
&gt; house.  So upon this request, myself, Joel, Jeff and Nancy brought  
&gt; several of the boxes to help assist the owner in some unanswered  
&gt; historical questions.  This session was amazing!  Although I can  
&gt; not disclosure the name of the location our little session may just  
&gt; be the exposure that the other side wants.  We will be turning our  
&gt; findings over to the owner and production company, and who knows,  
&gt; the box just may make its debut on the big screen.
&gt;
&gt; I would love your input on the attached files before I send them  
&gt; on.  I have many and have additional sessions still left to review.
&gt;
&gt; I thank you all in advance for you help and assistance!
