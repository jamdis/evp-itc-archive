&gt;       I have uploaded a few of my recent evp recorded on my olympus handheld from my circle group meeting we held when Keith Clark came down to visit us. It was great to meet him and Deborah Preece after knowing them both for so long online! They are both as passionate about this subject as I am.
&gt; 
&gt; I also uploaded some fantastic evp I recorded on the 4th of July out in my yard alone (if one is ever really alone LOL I think the voices contradict that statement). Almost all voices were quite loud and clear for my ears and required no filter or enhancement.You can listen to themhere:
