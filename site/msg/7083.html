own  
&gt; comment ought not to be the one suspending Bruce for responding to  
&gt; it. My opinion. Your milage may vary.
&gt; 
&gt; Misty, this is a decision for a list owner. I think that is you 
and  
&gt; no longer Frank.

&gt; &gt; Jeff,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Mind your buisness and go back to the kiddie table.
&gt; &gt; your not supposed to get involved in real peoples conversations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; before you open your mouth read the post that this post was in  
&gt; &gt; reply too.
&gt; &gt; who are you to suggest anything, when was the last time anybody
&gt; &gt; saw any research or files from you? OOPS I forget nobody EVER did.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Stop sticking your mouth where it does not belong.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That lost comment was uncalled for and extremely rude.  If you 
want  
&gt; &gt; to make comments like that then I suggest you make it offline in  
&gt; &gt; private email.

&gt; &gt; DON&quot;T BE HATIN!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; First off the reason I got a new box From Frank is because he  
&gt; &gt; recognises that
&gt; &gt; I am a serious researcher, It does not have anything to do with  
&gt; &gt; being a man
&gt; &gt; or woman. It has to do with being deserving of a Frank&#x27;s box and  
&gt; &gt; evidently!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well do I have to spell it out? Start putting some time into 
your  
&gt; &gt; research instead of
&gt; &gt; taking tantrums and maybe someday you&#x27;ll have a Frank&#x27;s box, But 
I  
&gt; &gt; doubt it!

&gt; &gt; hey guy&#x27;s
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have been lucky enough to not only have Frank&#x27;s box #12 but 
now  
&gt; &gt; Frank
&gt; &gt; has gifted me with a brand new box #29.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here are the first files to come out of it. And it has not even 
been
&gt; &gt; imprinted by mike and lisa yet. These files are from the first 30
&gt; &gt; seconds of the first session.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; let me know what you think.
