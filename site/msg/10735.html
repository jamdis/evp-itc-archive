Awesome, thanks Frank!  That was a great comparison!  There is a definite s=
ound difference when hearing them basically side-by-side like that.  I wasn=
't expecting as much of a difference.  I also agree with LC that the copper=
 seems to be less muffled.

The c=
opper box definitely gives a different sound than the steel. 
Could it be d=
ue to its thickness?  It seems less muffled (higher 
tones?) or something..=
