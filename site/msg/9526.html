&gt; Margaret,Before I became engrossed in box research I had done tons 
of research with every method of ITC imaging.I did Video Loop, water 
reflection, crystal, mirror, you name it.And got pretty good results 
from most.My most astounding visual itc came from a dicovery in my 
home.I have a crystal window in the front door of my house facing 
west, when the sun starts to go down it shines through this crystal 
window and projects onto the walls in my family room.I was sitting 
watching tv one day and happenned to look over at something that 
caught my attention, when I looked over there was a face looking 
back. I ran to get my digital camera and that started a year long 
process of experiments and spirit images I name VPI (visual 
projection imaging) I have literally hundreds of detailed images of 
spirits that where reflected through the crystal onto the walls in my 
home. as far as I can discern the spirits were forming the images 
inside of the crystal window, and the sun was acting as sort of a 
slide or movie projecter. Projecting their images onto the walls when 
it came through the window.I had a page on I am haunted for the 
longest time, and drew quite a following for my images. Alas since I 
discovered box research I have not done one imaging session.What got 
my attention was the mention of the horse image. I also captured the 
image of a horse, very detailed and a cat that you would think was 
sitting right in the room.Maragaret, please post the link to your 
site I did not get it and I would love to take a look.If anyone is 
interested let me know and I&#x27;ll post some of my images.Bruce
