 Re: I didn't ask about this stuff.


  I get a mix of stuff that seem like=
 coded dates, I think it points 
  to 2012. I hate to ask quaestions, cuz t=
hen I think you expect an 
  answer and either create it, or read more into=
 the voices than there 
  is. I count on my guys to give me what I need.
