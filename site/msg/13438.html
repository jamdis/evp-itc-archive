&gt; Opinion follows:
&gt; I think what most people forget when they view the reality TV shows 
&gt; such as Door to the Dead, Ghost Hunters, Paranormal State, etc., 
are 
&gt; that these ARE Reality TV shows and nothing more.  I watch them as 
&gt; entertainment, and nothing more.
&gt; Yes, there are some real investigations going on concerning the 
&gt; paranormal, EVP, ITC spirit communication, entity dicovery, etc., 
but 
&gt; 99.9% of the time you will not be witnessing a real investigation 
&gt; going on in a reality TV show. (G.H. DttD, P.S., etc.)
&gt; These type venues are about making money in the form of advertising 
&gt; dollars.
&gt; Your REAL investigations are being done by &#x27;unknowns&#x27; and people, 
and 
&gt; groups with nothing more than a few tools and a cheap video camera; 
&gt; not TruTV, Discovery Channel, or History Channel.
&gt; You usually don&#x27;t see REAL investigations on TV.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, Ghost Hunters is the self proclaimed number one paranormal 
venue 
&gt; on the tube, but do you really think they are following REAL 
&gt; investigative techniques?
&gt; If you&#x27;ve seen the show... you should have that answer.
&gt; 
&gt; G.H. is scheduled to come to a local Inn near me; an Inn that has 
&gt; very very few incidents of paranormal activity in its past history.
&gt; BUT, I bet when I see that episode on G.H., there will be more 
&gt; activity in the first hour of the show than has gone on in the 
entire 
&gt; history of the INN.  WHY???  Becasue it&#x27;s reality TV and to make 
&gt; money they have to induce activity and action... otherwise no one 
&gt; will watch.
&gt; 
&gt; So... bottom line.  Don&#x27;t view shows like G.H., Door to the Dead, 
&gt; Paranormal State, and the others as the definition of an 
&gt; investigative series... watch them for the entertainment value, and 
&gt; you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.....
&gt; 
&gt; Okay... stepping off the paranormal soapbox now.
&gt; Thanks for listening!

&gt; &gt; I am pleased that the outcome for the family was positive. And I 
am 
&gt; not surprised. The key I think is that a belief system was 
&gt; successfully altered. This in turn likely impacted the focal 
person, 
&gt; who based on the limited information presented could have been the 
&gt; young man. 
&gt; .........to achieve them most likely. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thank you for your interest as this is an important topic of 
&gt; discussion.
