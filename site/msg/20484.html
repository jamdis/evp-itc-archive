In a world where fashion and style define every aspect of our
lives庸rom buying watches to the dress we will wear to the next
party, the importance of makeup cannot be over emphasized&quot;

 I don&#x27;t think she realize what the group was for, but still welcome. I
don&#x27;t mean to be demeaning, and as the official Galatic Purple Princess, I
could use some fashion education, maybe it carry over to the next level. I
approve that one!
