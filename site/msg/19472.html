I appreciate all your help Ursula. Although I'd l=

I've bough=
t things from China in the past, and although it's a long wait, the stuff i=
s usually good. But once I got a portable cd writer, and they sent me the c=
ase only. When I told them they advertised it in the title as a writer, the=

 about buying from China. I waited over 2 months for something that wasn't =
even what I purchased. Grrrr....
