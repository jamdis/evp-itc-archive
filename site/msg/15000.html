The hose was made of brick, concrete and steel. The only wood was in the ro=
of. The house was used for lots of strange rituals and sex parties=A0in the=
 50's and 60's. In the twenties it was a speak-easy and whore house. There =
were beds that hung from chains from the ceiling downstairs. Not kidding, a=
