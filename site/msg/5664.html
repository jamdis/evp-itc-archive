<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That is her name, and that&#x27;s what they called me at first (&quot;Kiera, 
it&#x27;s time to come home&quot; in 2002). When I asked via EVPmaker back in 
2002, they she was their Princess. Then they called me Purple, and 
Purple Princess. That pretty much started with one of the first 
boxes, and cowboy like voice &quot;Well! It&#x27;s Gull darn Purple Princess!&quot; 
From then on, they insist I&#x27;m that person, even if I try to tell them 
they are full of BS--or blind. 

 Most people seem to refuse to follow the instructions with EVPmaker, 
use regular speech as the raw, and adjust the settings for best 
results. It&#x27;s mind numbing to hear the various ways the program is 
adulterated in it&#x27;s use. I have yet to meet anyone that used it like 
it was intended.

&gt; Right on the money.
&gt; Evp maker works better for you than it ever did for me.
&gt;  
&gt; They refer to kiera quite often, maybe that is the actual name of 
the 
&gt; Purple princess?

&gt;  This is a first, as far as I can remember. I don&#x27;t know who Vergi 
is, at least on this level, it&#x27;s more likely this amnesia that we all 
suffer from on this level. I like EVPmaker cuz you tend to get higher 
levels.   When EVPmaker works, it puts everything else to shame.
