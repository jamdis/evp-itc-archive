Since according to Theosophy the next \nAstrological \n&gt; Age, the Age of Aquarius, will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) \n&gt; Ray (the Ray of Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes \n&gt; called &#39;The Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius&#39;. According to the \n&gt; Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain is &#39;The God of Freedom \nfor \n&gt; the Earth&#39;.&#39;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Much to do with the Purple Princess, and the seven. I don&#39;t mean \n&gt; to sell others short, I just get a different level, and find \n&gt; regular &quot;this your auntie&quot; type EVPs kinda useless. Mostly I don&#39;t \n&gt; post every voice I get, just the ones that I thought was \n&gt; outstanding, but no one else hears.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Make i&#39;m yours.
