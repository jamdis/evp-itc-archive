Hi Steve & Mike,

This probably wouldn't work; the allophones must=
 all have the same
pitch to fit together when concatenated.

Of course the robotic sound of the =
SpeechJet allophones is far from
being natural speech, but it seems to allo=
w longer messages than other
raw audio with more variety of the sounds. So =
it seems we'll have to
decide between information content and naturalness/ =
individuality of the
voices.
