<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It doesn&#x27;t matter, the radio sweeps by itself anyway.  Both versions 
i believe have buttons on it with a digital face.  Mine is White, 
i&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the old design or new.  The White one you 
have to pull the pin off the board, it&#x27;s 3rd up from the bottom and 
says mute next to it.  I used a pair of needle noise pliers and 
ripped it out, but probably not the best method.  You probably 
should heat up the solder on the back of the board and than just 
pull it out.  It works really well though, i&#x27;m gonna try $1 store 
radios next and see what happens.  If it works they also have $1 
store speakers too.  A nice $2 combo box w/speakers, sounds too good 
to be true so i&#x27;m sure you can&#x27;t modify the cheap ones.

&gt; Thanks for clarifying that. Hey Steve, do you think the dial or 
button version of the radio is better for what we do? All the best,

Bill,
&gt;  
&gt;  Although i would love to take credit for that site with the step 
by 
&gt;  step instructions, it&#x27;s not me.  Another member posted that on 
here, 
&gt;  his name is Sum.  I was bored yesterday and bought a radio from 
&gt;  radio shack and did the modification in my kitchen and only took 
a 
&gt;  few moments to do.  I recorded a five minute session and got some 
&gt;  good files from it, so i sent it to Sum to show him that the 
radio 
&gt;  worked and thanked him for helping me with the mod.  He asked if 
he 
&gt;  could use my files on that site that he was making 
ghostboxhack.com  
&gt;  so i said sure.  I&#x27;m just a researcher, but after yesterday i 
feel i 
&gt;  can do some basic stuff with electronics now.

&gt;  &gt; Wow how cool is that? The step by step site made me feel 
smarter 
&gt;  than
&gt;  &gt; I should. I can&#x27;t wait till you post the keypad hack. And your
&gt;  &gt; recordings are spot on! Thanks Steve. -Bill

&gt;  &gt; &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   It depends, i realized today i got an older version of that 
&gt;  part #. 
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   So, i had to pull the pin out, but the newer ones all you 
have 
&gt;  to do 
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   is cut the mute wire. I was pretty impressed myself, i have 
&gt;  been 
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   doing this for a while with several different methods and 
now 
&gt;  i have 
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   another. ITC never gets boring that&#x27;s for sure.

&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; Those responses sound very good. Time to go pick one up 
and 
&gt;  see if 
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   it works 
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; for me ; )
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; Which pin opens the mute circuit?

&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;I was bored today and went out and bought one of these, 
i&#x27;m 
&gt;  gonna 
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   post
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; some of my files from a 5 minute session testing it 
out. 
&gt;  It was 
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   less
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; than a ten minute modification to this radio shack 
radio 
&gt;  and it 
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   works
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; pretty good. Let me know what you think of these files.
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; Thanx Sum,

&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt; Just Hacked a radio shack model 12-469
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt; Cut the Mute pin and presto a fm sweep cheap!
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt; Cost 24.95 and about ten minutes time.
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s not expensive.
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll post the complete hack later this weekend!
