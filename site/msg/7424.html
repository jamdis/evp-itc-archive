<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>For as long as I can remember...the Dead have been bothering 
me....mostly in my sleep. I suppose this is when I am left off guard.
I have had all ages all eras and all walks of life approach me. Some of 
it has been very sad...some, well deserved. 
I NEVER feel alone...in fact, &quot;THEY&quot; see to it that I am not alone...if 
I close the bathroom door...they open it...when I go to bed...the hover 
over me...I ALWAYS hold the rail when I go down the stairs...It never 
ends.
My cats cry when I leave and my dog growls at around 3 am every morning.
In fact, worse than this...A dog I know comes from a neighbor...but 
have never seen...goes crazy at 3 am...every morning...barking at my 
yard.
Match this to the weird photos I have taken of my yard and it is kind 
of creepy.
I have very weird photos...my yard seems to be the place of energy.
My house is over 106 years old...
Lots of stuff...but mostly since hubby dug the fire pit.</pre>
