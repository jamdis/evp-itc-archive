You tune in a language you don&#39;t understand, \nannounce your&#39;e doing an EVP session and record from a short distance \nform the speaker. Often on play back there will be meaningful \nmesasages in your language mixed in with the orignial broadcast. It&#39;s \ncontraversial, and people that speak the language used can&#39;t hear the \nmessages.  i also like to tune between station on an AM radio when \nskip is coming in, that results in some clear and meaningful voices.\n Frank-S  \n\n --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Marlboro63@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Frank,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have a ham radio with a built in scan mode.
