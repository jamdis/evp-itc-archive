<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Steve,
 I never wrote that e-mail you have me confused with someone else, 
thats number one-number two don&#x27;t start petty bickering if you do not 
want a responce. I will agree on one thing that it should not be 
conducted on this group. as far as driving 15-20 minutes to borrow a 
box from you ,you  offered the box for one week witch would not do any 
good anyway and I informed you that I was disabled and not up to 
driving at that time. this is a childish tit for tat discussion and I 
will not give it any further attention. My apologies to the group for 
having to tolerate this nonsense.
