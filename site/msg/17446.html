<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That much I have experience, a darker-for lack of a term, group that seems
to want to supress these attempts at bridging demensions. Curiously, to make
them stop harrassing me, I just erase them from the tape and they seem to
not bother me in future recordings. Part of it was that if I had something
that seem to really help the communication I would get these darkheads.

 I don&#x27;t get the hevan stuff, or rarely get any of that. I get suggestive
communications, like I used to get my mother in-law until on time the said
&quot;Joanne got a new body and moved up two steps&quot;.

&gt; Some groups of spirit and demon groups, in the lower realms were getting a

&gt; other&#x27;s, or trying to get them to back out I guess, &quot;dark heads&quot; are not
&gt; happy about all those people leaving the darkness going into the light,
&gt; because if they don&#x27;t &quot;repent&quot; they will be left in total darkness for a
&gt; thousand earth years, and &quot;the door is going to be shut tight.&quot; and they
&gt; will only have the company of each other in total blackness, void of light,
&gt; like an outer darkness, so, they are trying to slow things down.   I guess,
&gt; so want us to play music to calm things down, and probably didn&#x27;t want the
&gt; negative energy heard, they were cussing, hissing and stuff like that, I do
&gt; have it recorded to for those who doubt.  So, whomever it was asked me to
&gt; play some music.  I don&#x27;t think it is good to pass that negative stuff
&gt; around, there is enough of that on these lists already.  But, it was good to
&gt; prove a point about the FCC rules for Code of Conduct for radio stations,
&gt; that both Bruce, Steve, and other&#x27;s have already mentioned. sf
