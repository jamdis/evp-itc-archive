Don't worry Ann, there is nothing wrong with being a skeptic. Just don't fall into the category of close-minded skeptic, where you dismiss a claim for the sake of dismissing it and not because you have proof it is false. I don't claim to be skeptical for reasons you will read below, although at one time I was....

The message I posted from technician was a specific message by technician for the members of INIT. It was not a general message to the world. What it does a good job of is outlining their purpose and identifying obstacles. What a lot of people do not realize is that most of these messages you receive are not for anyone other that the one who receives them. They are personal! Mark and Rolf both shared a great deal of information with me as well as others. Mark has personally told me he don't care who believes or doesn't believe the things that happened then. Those experiences changed him for life and will always will be help by him as truth.

At the present moment Rolf, Dr. Senkowski and Hans are translating Adolf Holmes journals and writings into English. They are being posted piece by piece on the World ITC website. You may have not noticed because the changes have not been announced but they have been posting them since last June. 

As for the validity of the events of the pioneers I have to give them credence just from my own experiences since I began. I have had many wonderful things happen while I have been experimenting with the many methods and aspects of ITC. These experiences have made me realize that those events that you and I have read about are not that outlandish and are absolutely possible.

Regards,

Frank R.

Yes, they may have done, but how much of that was ever made public?  

Not very much. Even today. I have gone through what has been  

released, about six times over. Mark has let more out than just about  

anyone. The key players, Maggie and Jules, have made very little of  

theirs available indeed. I'd love to see that change so that we can  

better access what was going on.



At the time INIT was together, I was rather desperately wanting and  

asking for more information. When things began to be made public in  

the United States, it was translated newsletters- -again anecdotal--no  

attached files, obviously; photos that looked produced with 1980s  

xerox technology (It *was* the 1980s, after all); a lot of second- 

hand stories and a a few first-hand ones passed from person to person  

via letters and telephone conversations. Later, there was audio from  

researchers like Sarah who let her phone messages from Raudive be  

made public. As I noted, I don't have a problem with most of those.  

Obviously, a voice was recorded on an answering machine and can still  

be listened to today. I'd prefer to think that voice really is  

Raudive, but remember that it was not EVP--it was real phone calls.



When Macy wrote his book about it, Miracles in the Storm, I was  

figuratively, if not literally, the the first person who bought it. I  

thought, "now I am finally going to find out what really happened and  

be awed by the incredible evidence." Only Mark's book offered none of  

that for me. I was just looking at the customer reviews for the book  

on Amazon, because I thought I had written a review of it there at  

the time. I didn't, but here is one from someone who pretty much sums  

up what I think about it: "Macy's book focuses mainly on the  

personality conflicts that undermined an attempt at high-tech  

communications with the spirit world. His style is readable and  

brisk, his tone sincere and unaffected, but he provides little or no  

evidence that the phenomena he describes are authentic. The main  

researchers he depicts come off more as enthusiastic dilettantes than  

serious scientists. For me, Macy forfeits nearly all credibility when  

he casually declares that the history of the human race can be  

understood by integrating some of the spirit communications with the  

writings of Erich von Daniken (p.140)! Von Daniken, of CHARIOTS OF  

THE GODS fame, is an entirely discredited huckster. If Macy can be  

persuaded by von Daniken's pop-culture writings, he will probably  

believe just about anything. There is an unfortunate messianic tone  

pervading the book - the message that a new dawn of humanity is  

coming, courtesy of the spirit communicators and the mortals who  

spread their message. You'll probably find MIRACLES IN THE STORM  

enjoyable and easy to read (hence three stars), but it will convince  

no one who isn't already a believer."



I mentioned $cientology wryly, and I should have put in a ;) or  

something--my bad--but I do stand by the similarity in message and  

tone. I'm not conflating the two, I'm just pointing out what makes me  

wary, and the sentence, "our progress toward a free, wealthy and sane  

future in which humanity would have stripped off the chains of  

intolerance and cruelty" is especially redolent.



In short, while I do believe that we all need to evolve into more  

loving and spiritual beings, and I have tried all my life to do so  

with a few limited successes, I still find that becoming "better" is  

not tantamount to becoming less critical or buying into every  

messiah's momentum. As I've said before, I want to believe, but I  

will not believe only because I want to. And I'm not even saying that  

the whole INIT thing was a fraud. It wasn't. But I do think that  

there are aspects of it that were, or that were highly inflated. And  

we have to be honest about that or we can't really be honest about  

what is unshakable in paranormal research.



And this is just my own opinion, and we know what opinions are like,  

and perhaps I am one. But I hope you will humor me and keep me around  

because even one of those has its uses. ;)



Your friend,



Ann
