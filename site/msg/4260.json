That&#39;s what I thought you were doing, with respect to \nthe 12-470 speaker and a mic.

Can you clarify how your RS hack system is set-up when \nyou are receiving messages such as this one and in the files: &quot;11-26-\n07_radio shack hack files_bruce&quot;. They seem much cleaner than what I \nam getting with the 12-469. Are these recorded right out of the \nspeaker with an amped mic picking up your voice and the speaker \nsounds?Thanks...LC--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; guy&#39;s&gt; &gt; During a session with \nthe RS 470 my technition mike told me that our &gt; fellow researcher \nJeff&#39;s uncle was going to die from suffering a stroke.&gt; &gt; I informed \njeff of the message and sent him the file.
