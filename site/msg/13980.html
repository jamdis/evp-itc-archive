<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have to second what Frank mentioned.  The EVP Maker/allophones combo is excellent, in my opinion.  I know a lot of folks do not like it, but I find it utterly fascinating.  It is an animal all it&#x27;s own so I can&#x27;t really compare it to radio sweep, however, I do recommend people trying it to see if it might be a good match for them.  I&#x27;ve been working with it since Stefan created the allophones file and have been consistently amazed at the results.  

Of all methods I&#x27;ve tried, I have the most success with &quot;real-time, two-way&quot; communication via this combination.  It took some getting used to, hearing the relevant parts while ignoring the rest, but once I got the hang of that it become more and more easy as I worked with it.

Frank, it&#x27;s great to read there&#x27;s a possibility of some inexpensive FB&#x27;s coming along.  Very cool.

&gt;  There should be cheap FBs available soon, if the rumors I hear are
&gt; correct.  I have printed circuit boards made, but the troubel is---no tuner!
&gt; I don&#x27;t want to have to rely on the Radio Shack models--that they
&gt; discontinued, and so far home made tuners are just too noisy(staticy).
&gt; 
&gt;  In the mean time, like Margaret said, many of the oterh method work as
&gt; well, and sometimes better. There&#x27;s also EVPmaker.

&gt; &gt; Hi Susan. I don&#x27;t know what kind of box you&#x27;ll end up with, but in the
&gt; &gt; meantime, you can always do &quot;manual radio sweep.&quot; I get some of my best
&gt; &gt; results that way. When I started doing sweep for EVP, commercially available
&gt; &gt; boxes were not available. My favorite unit so far is the Duracell KP028
&gt; &gt; crank flashlight/radio. It might be listed as the &quot;3 in 1&quot; or something like
&gt; &gt; that. The knob is just the right size and tightness to make it easy to sweep
&gt; &gt; from one end to the other. Of course, it&#x27;s a little obnoxious to have to
&gt; &gt; stop and crank it up every few minutes, but I think the results make it well
&gt; &gt; worth the effort. I&#x27;ve seen others have good success with all kinds of
&gt; &gt; different radios though. So many makes/models can work well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I own the Paranormal Systems units and many of the Radio Shack hacks, and
&gt; &gt; by comparison, this little $20 model really holds it&#x27;s own. PLUS it would be
&gt; &gt; handy in case of power outage. I think it&#x27;s always great to have items
&gt; &gt; around the house that can fulfill more than one purpose. And so budget
&gt; &gt; friendly too. ;-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just a thought.....

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi frank, I am new to your ground and I was curious where if you have a
&gt; &gt; site where you sell the boxes that you make personally.. I know that I can I
&gt; &gt; buy one of the standard boxes in various places or I could make one my
&gt; &gt; self... if only I was suave enough to be able to fallow the directions..
&gt; &gt; unfortunately I have never really been a direction type of person.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have always been extra sensitive and very interested in EVP and the
&gt; &gt; paranormal every since I was very little and when I heard of your boxes
&gt; &gt; recently I became very excited and would love to buy one, can you point me
&gt; &gt; in the right direction..
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you, Susan
