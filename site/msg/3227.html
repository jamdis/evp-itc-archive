Welcome to the group Lee
   
  Yes as I have said before they are pretty direct in speech. All it takes is a mind open enough to hear. Glad you could hear them. Not everyone can/will.

          Hello everyone, I thought I would introduce myself, my name is Lee 
and I own and host Pulse Talk Radio this is a show that is partly 
entertainment and partly informative. 

Just lately we have been covering "the Box" mainly Joes box but 
always with reference to Franks, I have always been fascinated by 
EVP and progressive paranormal research equipment so I caught on to 
this subject rather quickly and it now has captured my imagination.

I'm not electronically minded but know what a capacitor and Micro 
chip look like and I'm very good with theory's and hope I can help 
with input into this amazing piece of equipment/subject, you may ask 
why should he be amazed by something he has only heard of and does 
not own, well I have been on a live box session over Skype and this 
box clearly said Hello Lee in response to a direct question, now to 
a open minded sceptic like myself this was a revelation and now I'm 
hooked on the whole concept, not to say I'm a believer but very much 
in to researching the idea further

I would also like to say great job on Frank's part for inventing the 
box, when you get to know me you will see what a mile stone it is to 
get me to sit up and take note such is my scepticism on the whole 
paranormal subject. I respect those that strive to make new 
equipment for us the paranormal investigation world, keep up the 
good work I will be watching closely for up dates and try and pitch 
my ten cents in when I thinks it's warranted
