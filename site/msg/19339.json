Not only that,\n&gt; spirits and other entities talk backward too.  I had a reversing deck, but\n&gt; it broke in our move. You can record yourself, and reverse it, use it for\n&gt; psycho analysis. We&#39;re dealing with mind, not brain, so this stuff is\n&gt; universal.\n&gt;\n&gt; F-S\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Nov 30, 2010 at 4:05 PM, Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t know if you have heard of this guy, but John Oates has made a living\n&gt;&gt; claiming that reverse speech messages are the one way the unconscious cannot\n&gt;&gt; lie.  He also claims that reverse speech messages are almost always linked\n&gt;&gt; to the forward speech message.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Some of his examples are quite intriguing, but I don&#39;t buy it fully yet.\n&gt;&gt;  I have recorded my own voice and played it backwards and got zilch.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But, if there is some truth to it, maybe we should all be reversing some\n&gt;&gt; of our files from time to time just in case.  Wouldn&#39;t it be a startling\n&gt;&gt; find to have this be true not only of the living, but also in those who\n&gt;&gt; communicate through the box a well.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://www.reversespeech.com/Simple_Examples.htm\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  &lt;http://www.reversespeech.com/Simple_Examples.htm&gt;Tim\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Tue, Nov 30, 2010 at 5:46 PM, Frank Sumption &lt;\n&gt;&gt; purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  [Attachment(s)&lt;https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&view=js&name=main,tlist&ver=b1_WpQkzs8s.en.&am=%2110dEyMHDV0SxhZ5ijtQ2BJKmLyOdKCgMTqG0rdjvFN8dECfogY-iKw&fri#12c9f0896c824766_12c9ef77032341cf_TopText&gt;from Frank Sumption included below]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Just about yelling it now.
