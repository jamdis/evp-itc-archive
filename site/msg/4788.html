Thanks Ann, I'm trying. 
   
  I would like to set up a group participation for a group session in this up and coming month.  I would like to get a series of questions together and have everyone with the same box's do a session at the same time using these questions.  
   
  It would be interesting to see what we all get as well as if some of the same voices come through for all of us.  
   
  I know I have heard Steve come through when we were doing a session at the same time, and his and Bruces tecs voices have been verified by them and have come through to verify things if I had a problem during my sessions.  
   
  So with this knowledge, we should pursue different avenues which could possible eliminate the fact of common voices via radio stations, given we all don't have the same hosts or the same radio stations across the country.  This may had credence to our research.  What do you think?
   
  Just a thought!
  Juli
