For me Amy, it's been about establishing a relationship with those I can no=
t always see.

I differ with your point of view about a door being open or =
closed. Unless you take it as you're starting to pay attention more to your=
 surroundings, in my oppinion they are always there, always have been, but =
you didn't take notice.  Once you start to take notice, ask them for help e=
tc, then the evps and answers to your questions will come.  I also suspect =
that there is a building type situation going on that would make it easier =
for them to communicate with you. I have seen the ecto in the shape of horn=
s going into my computer, which is substancial to me when the voices change=
.  It's all about energy.  We are energy they are energy everything in this=
 world is energy, we just need to learn to harness it and use it to get wha=
t we want.  look around your home.  do you see horizontal lights? do you se=
e orbs? if not thats okay, it will happen as you learn to notice things tha=
t you've been too busy to see.

  well if yall are very expiereinced in th=
is, i just started doing evp's a few weeks ago!
  I know that these folks h=
ave been around me and some are where i live. the first time i did an evp i=
 got nothing till the 3rd time. Then its seems that it opened a door for th=
em, they are conversing amongst themselves saying hello to each other, that=
 they can see, they can see the computer, one of them said he was beseiged.=
 I didnt record again till yesterday, and i kinda wonder if they are mad? i=
 kept getting vibes to record but have been to tired with moving. Can they =
get mad with you? i assume they can. When i recorded, i have been using mic=
rosoft word and typing my questions, and a little bit of talking too, if th=
ey can see the computer <so they said> why not?! I also used this thing fro=
m EVP maker that shows pictures and makes clicks and tones. The only thing =
they had to say was "watch" watch", wether they ment to not say anything an=
d just watch m e or refering to some of the questions i had, i dont know, c=
ant assume anything lol. What can i do to get them to talk to me more? Answ=
er questions? like no one has indentified themselves and i would really lik=
e to know who they are. I have a few people i would like to talk to that ha=
ve passed over. However anyone is nice lol. I just would like to open this =
door MORE now, that i have closed off. I think that I opened a doorway for =
them but i want to interact more! People have been refering to me as a "sen=
sitive"? I assume meaning that i am able to tell if they are here etc. Whic=
h i usually can. Is it possible that because in the past for the most part =
i have kept this part of me closed off, except those entities that refuse t=
o be silenced come through, that they are skeptical of talking to me? That =
i cant handle it?

  Anyway, justthought id talk with somemore people who h=
ave "been there done that"
  I would like to have someone over who has alot=
 of history and do an evp in my home and talk to them for me. <sigs>
