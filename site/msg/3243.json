Or a swept tuned Walkman. I&#39;ve been thinking about the Mini box, and we&#39;ve shown on this group that the sound chamber I use is definately not needed, so that eliminates the mics and added amps as well. I kinda missed the manufacturing boat by not doing more testing, or being stuck on a concept. Not that I&#39;m all that concerned, I had no desire to make money off this stuff, and that probelm seems to have been solved. \n&gt;  Despite concerns by the more conserative researchers, I guess I could call them, I have never seen any one harmed by any kind of oracle device(granted-I don&#39;t get out much).  I think getting this stuff out there in the public is a good thing.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Share life as it happens with the new Windows Live.Download today it&#39;s FREE!\n&gt; http://www.windowslive.com/share.html?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_Wave2_sharelife_112007\n&gt;\n = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =    Hi Frank & All,  I like your name for the latest one: &quot;Ghostman Box&quot;!
