Hey Ralph,

You may want to ask Frank Sumption about purple. He is called the "purple princess" or Keira and the purples are referred to as a race of aliens or highly evolved spirits. 

The newer human spirits that come into my sessions will introduce themselves with first and last names. If they are non-human or never incarnate they usually refer to themselves by what they do (their job) or will be real cryptic. You may wanna request last names if you want them.

Most of my "regular" spirits laugh at the term "demon" and go off on a tangent of how limited our perspective is.... Some of the troublemakers will claim to be some kind of demon. My "regulars" will either run them off or Misty's aunties will run them off. LOL My general rule of thumb is only listen to the positive messages. Messages of doom and gloom, personal attacks on your character, gossip and stuff like that is not productive, though sometimes entertaining.

Keep it positive,

Frank R.

            Hi everyone,



I have been hearing the word " Purple " alot lately in my sessions.

Does anyone in the group know what it pertains to ? It's been bugging 

me alot. Could that be a special group on their side ? I have no clue. 

Also has anyone questioned the voices if they have a last name ? All I 

hear on the RS boxes are first names and haven't recieved anyone 

telling me their last name. Does Mike and Lisa have a last name ? Did 

anyone here ever ask the question " Are you Demonic Spirits ? " What 

was their reply if any ? I did one time and got a response saying " 

All of us are ". Don't know whether I believe that Spirit or not. 

Probably a Joker saying that. I have asked for specific people for 

them to find so I could talk to and got an answer " We're looking. " 

Then I never heard from them after that. I'm still waiting to be 

contacted by Telephone so far nothing yet. They make me laugh 

sometimes. I had the RS-12-469 on the one day I was just listening to 

what they were chatting about. I found my daughters old Fart Machine 

and was playing with it while the RS radio was running to see if it 

still works which it did. All of a sudden after I made it " Toot " I 

heard a female voice say " Phew !!! ."

LOL, I guess she thought I really passed one. Also, the other day I 

was on the RS 12-469 and I said " Hello Lisa how are you doing 

today ? " Then a few seconds later I hear a female voice say " 

Bruce ? " like she thought that I was Bruce talking to her. I told her 

no it's me Ralph from Harrisburg,PA she replied "Oh, okay fine. " I 

hear all the time voices calling for Lisa she must be a very Popular 

Technician. Oh well I guess it was more than one question LOL. Hey you 

all take care and " Keep the Sweep " a new slogan for here LOL. just 

kidding. You all have a great day.



Regards,



Ralph the Ghost Hunter
