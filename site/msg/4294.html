<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Is the speaker all I need or any kind of jack? For it?

Steve, will also ask Lisa if she&#x27;s aware of the &quot;technician&quot; who will  
hopefully be assisting me? I just want to get confirmation or  
rejection of what I seem to be sensing.

Thanks!

&gt; I went to radio shack and bought a speaker model #21-549 and it seems
&gt; to work fine. I got mine yesterday and didn&#x27;t seem to thrilled about
&gt; the results and gave another try tonight. Tonight, i spoke to several
&gt; different people in their own voices and really have to give credit to
&gt; Mike and Lisa for making this communication keep getting better. This
&gt; really is another valuable box in my research, as long as different
&gt; designs become available i will test them all. Every box is unique
&gt; and offers different results, but they all work off the same premise
&gt; of raw audio bits. Real time communication is finally here and gets
&gt; better every day, some day&#x27;s frank&#x27;s box is better and than some day&#x27;s
&gt; RS box...etc. Depends on your surroundings, your mood, the weather
&gt; but all these devices have worked for me up to this point and i&#x27;m
&gt; grateful.
&gt;
&gt; p.s.--here is the link to the speaker so you can get a visual.

&gt; Your going to love this wild ride and watching new people get involved
&gt; and posted results makes it all worth it for me.

&gt; &gt; Hey, fellow list dwellers who have one--what extra equipment to I
&gt; &gt; need to have to make this function (speakers, but not computer
&gt; &gt; speakers)? Anything else I can go out an get now? I am truly, truly
&gt; &gt; technology challenged, so guidance addressed to one like a toddler
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; what I need.
