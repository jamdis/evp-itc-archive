People all over the w=\r\norld scream for proof but yet if you ask them they cannot define what crite=\r\nria they require for proof. Why? Because they are so brainwashed in our soc=\r\nieties materialistic teachings they never expect to receive proof, so they =\r\ndon&#39;t even bother to define such a criteria.\n\n      Its amazing to me that =\r\na primarily spiritual creature such as ourselves can deny our connections w=\r\nith that world and the source. The connections we experience everyday and a=\r\nt all times in the form of dreams, random thoughts and inspirations are so =\r\neasily taken for granted and written off as figments of imagination, trivia=\r\nl thoughts and meaningless aspirations.

I don&#39;t care how many books \n          th=\r\ney&#39;ve written, or how many &quot;universities&quot; they&#39;ve given. When \n          so=\r\nmething knows how you think, what you are perceiving, and how it&#39;s \n       =\r\n   being perceived, you can&#39;t prevent yourself from being deceived, or \n   =\r\n       more like played with. I know I&#39;ll be deceived, and tricked, \n      =\r\n    and&nbsp;I tell them have fun with that, cuz I don&#39;t really care.

I find the communicat=\r\nion&nbsp;mode itself \n          facsinating, and don&#39;t expect that profound=\r\n paranormal knowledge \n          others seem to seek.
