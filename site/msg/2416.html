Yeah, it's a copmplex problem, no doubt if brain didn't have a function, i=
t wouldn't be there.

Frank, good point you're making that Persinger's research is confined=
to the how the brain reacts when there is substantial evidence tosupport th=
at notion that thought itself may occur outside of the brainin a yet undefi=
ned space.Some believe the brain is a tuner to access memory and intuition =
thatexist outside of the body. Of course it also acts as the switchboardfor=
 the body's central nervous system but it is the non-local thoughtconcept t=
hat I find intriguing. Perhaps the "tuner" in a psychicsbrain is not restri=
cted to just their own memories but can access thememories and feelings of =
the people the psychic targets.-Bill--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank S=
