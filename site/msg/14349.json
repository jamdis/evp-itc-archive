I have tried Goldwave a fe=\r\nw times. But couldn&#39;t remember the features. The High or Low pass filters a=\r\nre very helpfull. As well as the pitch (this changes the voice either highe=\r\nr or lower) that helps bring it out of the &quot;muddy&quot; static level. As far as =\r\nusing the &quot;noise eliminator&quot; be careful here...a little goes a long way. It=\r\n will make you audio sound like a bad organ piano :) The high or low filter=\r\n actually does what we are wanting the noise filter to do anyway.

Has option to slow the r=\r\necording down. Another nice feature is that you can use either a highpass o=\r\nr lowpass filter (sometimes that is all that is needed) and changing the PI=\r\nTCH is a very handy tool. Always KEEP an original copy of your recordings. =\r\nI just save a copy from inside audacity (to desktop or somewhere) then I wi=\r\nll start my work on trying to clear it up. Save the original (and proceedin=\r\ng enhanced version(s) by using the &quot;file&quot; button at to left corner oif prog=\r\nram. There you would SAVE &quot;selection&quot; as MP3.(To upload to here) or save to=\r\n WAV (is bigger) but higher qulity. Can always convert the wav to mp3 from =\r\nwithing audacity also. *you will need to get the mps &quot;pluging&quot; from the web=\r\nsite, and follow the information to install it &quot;manually&quot; (once is only nee=\r\nded) that way you get the mp3 converter program free.

Ha=\r\ns option to slow the \n  recording down. Another nice feature is that you ca=\r\nn use either a highpass or \n  lowpass filter (sometimes that is all that is=\r\n needed) and changing the PITCH \n  is a very handy tool. Always KEEP an ori=\r\nginal copy of your recordings. I just \n  save a copy from inside audacity (=\r\nto desktop or somewhere) then I will start \n  my work on trying to clear it=\r\n up. Save the original (and proceeding enhanced \n  version(s) by using the =\r\n&quot;file&quot; button at to left corner oif program. There you \n  would SAVE &quot;selec=\r\ntion&quot; as MP3.(To upload to here) or save to WAV (is bigger) \n  but higher q=\r\nulity. Can always convert the wav to mp3 from withing audacity \n  also. *yo=\r\nu will need to get the mps &quot;pluging&quot; from the website, and follow the \n  in=\r\nformation to install it &quot;manually&quot; (once is only needed) that way you get \n=\r\n  the mp3 converter program free.
