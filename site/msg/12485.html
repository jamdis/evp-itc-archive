I&#x27;ve take precautions or just declined a case if its been one where I
feel myself or any members of the group might be in physical danger.

&gt; The advantage of once following Wicca is that you learn belief in a
thing gives it power.
&gt; That is why I don&#x27;t believe in the evil parts of this.  The more you
believe in them, the
&gt; more you are going to see them and the more they will mess with you.
&gt; 
&gt; In my opinion anyway.  Although in support of that theory, I&#x27;ve yet
to be hurt or 
&gt; possessed (that I know of)

&gt; This week we received an email from a guy in another group and he
was telling me that when he goes out on an investigation he takes
along a relic or two and holy water! I asked him if he carries all of
that...how does he have the hand movement to carry a digital camera,
Paranormal Puck, temperature detector, EVP recorder? He has yet to
answer...LOL. ..
&gt; Another guy who is a local investigator once posted that he carries
a GUN with him when he goes out on investigation! ! THIS guy scares me
way more than the relic toting, holy water thrower...
