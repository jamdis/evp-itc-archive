<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Testing a home made AM/FM tuner on FM. The oscillator coil is too small, so
it gets the very top of the band, here the last station is 107.5MHZ. So,
sweeping above the FM seems to result in --something--, mostly I think it&#x27;s
pick up in the IF stages of the radio, but at 1 second &quot;Hi--something&quot;.


 The tuning capacitor values are not given in the data sheet, so it&#x27;s guess
as to what varactor to use, with this version it&#x27;s two 13.5 pf varactors
back to back--or in series, so probably need to add some caps in parallel to
bring to oscillator frequency down. Just one of the varactors covered close
to half the band, but the tuning voltage range was less that a volt. Think
I&#x27;ll try a larger coil first. Just as easy to make this sweep below the band
as well.
