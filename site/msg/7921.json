Same I would imagine, but are any of them trying to tell us to change our ways, or warn us of anything to come, etc...\n   \n  Some of us on this group are already helping others here and there, and some are even helping the police agencies with what they learn.\n   \n  If they have a team like us,  what is the name of their group of like minded spirits?  What can all of us learn from them that we can share with humanity? \n   \n  To all on cc, are any of you or have any of you written books on your EVP experiences which share what you have learned?\n   \n  Please share what all of you have learned from them that can help humanity move forward in a positive way.  \n   \n  Like do they advise what we can do to bring about world peace?\n   \n  Mike Edwards Cary, NC\n\nEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n          \nHello,\n\nThis email message is a notification to let you know that\na file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \ngroup.\n\nFile : /Steve Hultay Files/Steve Hultay&#39;s Frank&#39;s Box #27/that&#39;s_important--yeah.mp3 \nUploaded by : urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@...&gt; \nDescription : &quot;That&#39;s Important&quot;---&quot;Yeah&quot; \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Steve%20Hultay%20Files/Steve%20Hultay%27s%20Frank%27s%20Box%20%2327/that%27s_important--yeah.mp3 \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n\nRegards,\n\nurkel232002 &lt;urkel23@...&gt;\n\n\n\n\n                           \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
