A lot of the time, they are talking about me like I am not even there.  In some of those clips, you can definitely hear them talking amongst themselves.\n\nThe main voice you hear (especially in clip 4) is my technician, or as I call him, my facilitator.  He is the one telling Raudive to ask his question and telling an Other to wait.  I have numerous clips where I will ask a question and I can hear him ask the same question of the Others.  This is all the personal proof I need (besides my name and facts about my life coming through a broken radio).  To hear your own words coming through the radio in a different voice is something that should be considered impossible...but then to get an answer back from those reiterated words, well, I consider that pretty damn good evidence that there is an intelligence trying to communicate.\n\nBut then again, any scientist can easily say that I was experiencing nothing more that a Ham radio operator having fun at my expense.  My only come back to this is that since I still a ghost hunter, I have traveled extensively to different locations.  I have been bringing my box out in to the field for location experiments.  Guess what?  My facilitator speaks in every spot, in every state that I have tried this in.  \n\nTim\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, leongbabe@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Tim,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for sharing your files - I heard a lot of different names in your clips Nos. 1-3, including the names Tim, Mark, and Steve; in clip No. 2, sounded like they&#39;re mostly talking among themselves.  In No. 1, I heard &quot;This is Tim ... what is that... enough power.... settled.&quot;  Nos. 4 and 5 are very clear - heard what you heard.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sharon from SF\n&gt;"}
