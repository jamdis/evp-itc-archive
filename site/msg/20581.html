&gt; Manual sweep.  Manual: From the word &quot;manu&quot; in latin meaning hand.  Manual sweep: Sweeping the radio dial by hand.  Does anyone have any questions?  Frank, who is giving you a hard time about this?  It sounds absolutely asinine that this even has to be discussed....

&gt; &gt;  It&#x27;s just occuring and I&#x27;m being made aware that most here, just don&#x27;t get
&gt; &gt; the concept of manual sweep, depsite the fact that it has been dicussed here
&gt; &gt; sin at least 2008. Manual--as in done by freaking hand, as in touching the
&gt; &gt; godamn dial!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Yeah, I am pissed, cuz no matter what I say it is completely ignored in
&gt; &gt; favor of the idiotic ghost hunter rap. Y&#x27;all don&#x27;t understand the sdimplest
&gt; &gt; concepts of spirit communcation, but I bet 90% here will claim to be box and
&gt; &gt; paranormal experts.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Those that do get it, I&#x27;m told are too f--- lazy to turn a radio dial, yet
&gt; &gt; are somehow more qualified to get higher spirit communication.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  I don&#x27;t know what to say, I thought I was totaly fed up before.... Just
&gt; &gt; keep chasing yuur retarded lime lights--that&#x27;s fame a fortune that 99% here
&gt; &gt; are really after, and forget I was ever here!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Supposedly you have to crawl before you walk, y&#x27;all want to skip crawling,
&gt; &gt; and walking and fly the space shuttle. Clueless!!
