Bruce,
  I really appreciate this text and these links.  Being Catholic, my mom and my brother have both expressed concern in light of my recent experimentation with voice phenomena.  This is helpful, to say the least.
  All my best,
  Ursula

It puts to rest certain researchers claims of warning by the vatican 
and catholic church against evp-itc research or methods of research.

as a matter of fact they support it undoubtedly.

The Vatican supports EVP

Unknown to many Christians?Catholics, Protestants and Fundamentalists�
the Catholic Church has been actively positive and encouraging 
towards investigation of the Electronic Voice Phenomena.

� Two of the earliest investigators were Italian Catholic priests, 
Father Ernetti and Father Gemelli, who came upon the phenomena by 
chance while they were recording Gregorian chants in 1952. 

� Father Gemelli heard his own father's voice on the tape calling him 
by a childhood nick-name saying 'Zucchini, it is clear, don't you 
know it is I '.

� Deeply troubled by Catholic teaching in regard to contact with the 
dead the two priests visited Pope Pius XII in Rome. 

� The Pope reassured them:

Dear Father Gemelli, you really need not worry about this. The 
existence of this voice is strictly a scientific fact and has nothing 
to do with spiritism. The recorder is totally objective. It receives 
and records only sound waves from wherever they come. This experiment 
may perhaps become the cornerstone for a building for scientific 
studies which will strengthen people's faith in a hereafter .
(Italian Journal Astra, June 1990 quoted Kubis and Macy, 1995: 102).

� Pope Pius' cousin, the Rev. Professor Dr Gebhard Frei, co-founder 
of the Jung Institute, was an internationally known parapsychologist 
who worked closely with Raudive, a pioneer in the research. He was 
also the President of the International Society for Catholic 
Parapsychologists. He himself is on record as stating: 

All that I have read and heard forces me to believe that the voices 
come from transcendental, individual entities. Whether it suits me or 
not, I have no right to doubt the reality of the voices (Kubris and 
Macy, 1995:104).

� Dr Frie died on October 27, 1967. In November 1967 at numerous 
taping sessions a voice giving its name as Gebhard Frei came through. 
The voice was identified by Professor Peter Hohenwarter of the 
University of Vienna as positively belonging to Dr Frei (Ostrander 
and Schroeder, 1977: 271).

� Pope Paul VI was well aware of the work being done from 1959 
onwards on the Elecronic Voices by his good friend, Swedish film 
producer Friedrich Jurgenson, who had made a documentary film about 
him. The Pope made Jurgenson a Knight Commander of the Order of St 
Gregory in 1969 for his work (see picture left). Jurgenson wrote to 
Bander, a British voice researcher:

I have found a sympathetic ear for the Voice Phenomenon in the 
Vatican. I have won many wonderful friends among the leading figures 
in the Holy City. Today 'the bridge' stands firmly on its foundations 
(Ostrander and Schroeder, 1977: 264).

� The Vatican also gave permission for its own priests to conduct 
research into the voices�Father Leo Schmid, a Swiss theologist, 
collected more than ten thousand of them in his book When the Dead 
Speak which was published in 1976, shortly after his death.

� Another Vatican-approved researcher was Father Andreas Resch who as 
well as conducting his own experiments began courses in 
Parapsychology at the Vatican's school for priests in Rome (Kubris 
and Macy, 1995:104). 

� In 1970 the International Society for Catholic Parapsychologists 
held a conference in Austria and a major part of that conference was 
concerned with papers on the Electronic Voice Phenomena.

� In England in 1972 four senior members of the Catholic hierarchy 
were involved in the famous Pye recording studio tests conducted by 
Peter Bander.

� Father Pistone, Superior of the Society of St Paul in England, said 
in an interview after the tests:

I do not see anything against the teaching of the Catholic Church in 
the Voices, they are something extra-ordinary but there is no reason 
to fear them, nor can I see any danger (Bander 1973: 132).

The Church realizes that she cannot control the evolution of science. 
Here we are dealing with a scientific phenomenon; this is progress 
and the Church is progressive. I am happy to see that representatives 
of most Churches have adopted the same attitude as we have: we 
recognize that the subject of the Voice Phenomena stirs the 
imagination even of those who have always maintained that there could 
never be any proof or basis for discussion on the question of life 
after death. This book and the subsequent experiments raise serious 
doubts, even in the minds of atheists. This alone is a good reason 
for the Church supporting the experiments. A second reason may be 
found in the greater flexibility of the Church since Vatican II, we 
are willing to keep an open mind on all matters which do not 
contradict Christ's teaching (Bander 1973:103).

� His excellence, Archbishop H.E. Cardinale, Apostolic Nuncio to 
Belgium, commented:

Naturally it is all very mysterious, but we know the voices are there 
for all to hear them (Bander 1973: 132).

� The Right Reverend Monsignor Professor C. Pfleger commented:

Facts have made us realize that between death and resurrection there 
is another realm of post-mortal existence. Christian theology has 
little to say about this realm (Bander 1973 : 133).

� Bander's book (1973: 133) contains a photograph of the Right 
Reverend Mgr. Stephen O'Connor, Vicar General and Principal Roman 
Catholic Chaplain to the Royal Navy, listening to the playback of a 
recording on which a voice had manifested claiming to be that of a 
young Russian naval officer known to himself who had committed 
suicide two years earlier. Dr Raudive had recorded the message 
independently at an earlier session.

� Since the 1970s the Vatican has continued to sponsor extensive 
research into all areas of parapsychology including Electronic Voice 
Phenomena. 

� Recently Father Gino Concetti, one of the most competent 
theologians in the Vatican, said in an interview:

According to the modern catechism, God allows our dear departed 
persons who live in an ultra-terrestrial dimension, to send messages 
to guide us in certain difficult moments of our lives. The Church has 
decided not to forbid any more the dialogue with the deceased with 
the condition that these contacts are carried out with a serious 
religious and scientific purpose (printed in the Vatican newspaper 
Osservatore Romano�cited in Sarah Estep's American Association 
Electronic VoicePhenomena, Inc Newsletter, vol 16 No, 2 1997 ) 

Clearly, the Catholic Church realizes that science is making 
enormous, inevitable, irreversible and cumulative progress which 
nobody is in a position to stop.
