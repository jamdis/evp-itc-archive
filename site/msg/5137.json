The 120 through 41 \nmeter bands are predominantly nighttime bands and you&#39;ll hear mostly \nstatic/noise during the day. The 49 and 41 meter bands usually start to \nopen in the late afternoon.\n\nThe 31 meter band right now might have stations audible at most times \nexcept for very late at night.\n\n25 meters and up are predominantly daytime bands.  Since we are at the \nsolar cycle minimum, the higher frequencies (15 meters and up) will \nprobably be dead most of the time. In another 4 years or so, when we reach \nthe peak of the new solar cycle 24, these higher frequencies may have \nstations audible in them round the clock. The 11-year solar cycle causes \nhigher frequencies to be fairly useless at the bottom (which is where we \nare now) and pushes the maximum usable frequency up to above 50 MHz at the \ncycle peaks.\n\nZack\n\nOn Wed, 9 Jan 2008, Frank Sumption wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Some shortwave info.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt; Meter Band\n&gt; Frequency Range\n&gt; Remarks\n&gt;\n&gt; 120 m\n&gt; 2,300 - 2,495 kHz\n&gt; tropic band\n&gt;\n&gt; 90 m\n&gt; 3,200 - 3,400 kHz\n&gt; tropic band\n&gt;\n&gt; 75 m\n&gt; 3,900 - 4,000 kHz\n&gt; shared with the amateur radio 75/80 meter band\n&gt;\n&gt; 60 m\n&gt; 4,750 - 5,060 kHz\n&gt; tropic band\n&gt;\n&gt; 49 m\n&gt; 5,900 - 6,200 kHz\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 40 m/41m\n&gt; 7,100 - 7,350 kHz\n&gt; shared with the amateur radio 40 meter band\n&gt;\n&gt; 31 m\n&gt; 9,400 - 9,900 kHz\n&gt; most heavily used band\n&gt;\n&gt; 25 m\n&gt; 11,600 - 12,100 kHz\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 22 m\n&gt; 13,570 - 13,870 kHz\n&gt; substantally used only in Eurasia\n&gt;\n&gt; 19 m\n&gt; 15,100 - 15,800 kHz\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 16 m\n&gt; 17,480 - 17,900 kHz\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 15 m\n&gt; 18,900 - 19,020 kHz\n&gt; almost unused, could become a DRM band\n&gt;\n&gt; 13 m\n&gt; 21,450 - 21,850 kHz\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 11 m\n&gt; 25,600 - 26,100 kHz\n&gt; may be used for local DRM broadcasting"}
