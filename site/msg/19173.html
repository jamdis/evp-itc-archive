<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This device is misused by almost everybody!  This is because the manual
sucks and the TV people use it wrong consistently.  To figure it out, I
contacted the manufacturer a couple years back and this is what they told
me.

Always us the Trifield in Magnetic mode.  If the box is stable and there is
no lightning, the box should not sound an alarm unless something paranormal
is happening (or you move your digital recorder to close to it, magnetized
speakers).  If you use electric or combination, you can, and will, pick up
the body electric with every motion and may receive many false positives.
 The meter should also never be used while walking because this too gives
unreliable readings.  There is nothing worse than seeing some TV schmuck
holding it in their hands and claiming something paranormal is going on
because an alarm is sounding, never mind that the camera is right next to it
emitting magnetism through the mic / internal speaker.

Also, the name trifield is a misnomer.  It only has one plane of reading,
not three!  The yellow one (AC) has three fields.  The natural trifield only
measures the plane that extends from the top and bottom edges lengthwise
from the devices.  So if you have the device sitting upright, you will only
measure whatever is above the device.  If you have it laying flat, you will
be able to measure the full plane of length extending beyond the bottom and
top edges.  Therefore, it is best to use this device slightly elevated and
laying flat.

Using it in this fashion has yielded some amazing results thus far.  While
it is rare for this meter to fire when used properly, when a &quot;spirit&quot;
understands how to trigger the alarm you can get conversations that can last
upwards of an hour.  I have experiences this only 6 times in all the years I
have investigated.  Most of the time, this device yields a single alarm, or
maybe two, with no real time interaction with questions.

&gt; I have a Trifield Natural EMF meter. It does not respond to 60 Hz fields.
&gt; The problem I have with it is that it is too darned sensitive. It registers
&gt; the magnetic field of the earth in magnetic and combination mode and
&gt; whenever I turn or move too quickly, the meter flicks. If I run it in
&gt; electric field mode it does not do this but I&#x27;m always afraid of missing
&gt; something, so I generally run it in combination mode.

&gt;&gt; Like Zack said, nobody knows for sure.  The only thing that we do know is
&gt;&gt; that there is a correlation between spikes in EMF&#x27;s and paranormal events.
&gt;&gt;  I have used various meters during GB sessions and there is a correlation at
&gt;&gt; times, but this has to be discounted solely because a radio uses part of the
&gt;&gt; EMF spectrum.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is theorized that EMF measurements are to be taken solely in DC current
&gt;&gt; because it is natural electricity.  So any EMF meter you have that measures
&gt;&gt; AC is worthless on an investigation because it picks up man made
&gt;&gt; electricity.  As for the range, well that is also speculative at best.  The
&gt;&gt; most current theories hold that under 30 Hz DC is where you will find the
&gt;&gt; most paranormal activity.  This is because the Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta
&gt;&gt; brainwaves of a human are all below 30 Hz.  This is where the Body Electric
&gt;&gt; fires and consciousness is formed.  If we are dealing with a continuation of
&gt;&gt; consciousness, results are more apt to be found in this range.
&gt;&gt;  Interestingly enough, the earth vibrates in this same range with 5 standing
&gt;&gt; waves at or below 33Hz (Shuman Resonance), so it appears that the new agers
&gt;&gt; are right when they say we vibrate with the Earth.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But, as always, no one knows for sure.  And no one knows if these
&gt;&gt; frequencies have anything to do with what we receive in GBC.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This has probably already been discussed a hundred times over by people
&gt;&gt;&gt; building ghost boxes, but... what&#x27;s the average emf range of ghosts... and
&gt;&gt;&gt; would creating sounds in that emf range make it easier for the ghosts to
&gt;&gt;&gt; communicate? And would it be possible to make those sounds heard somehow?
