So I&#39;m figuring how is this thing going to be any good, I \nget sucjh a crappy am signal that I was willing to try anything and \nhave.\n\nWell I recieved this antenna this morning and decided to take it to a \npart of the house where I have never gotten a signal, my basement.\n\nI turned on the 470 and as usual nothing but static, so I placed this \ndisc looking antenna about 8 inches from the 470 and started to turn \nthe knob on the antenna. I was asking mike and lisa if they could to \nplease come through. as I was turning this dial I began to hear the \nrs sweep the stations and mike said &quot;here&quot; I almost jumped out of the \nchair with excitement. I asked mike or lisa to tell me when the dial \nwas right and as I slowly turned it mike yelled &quot;STOP&quot; after a few \nminutes of small talk I ended the session with lisa saying &quot;it&#39;s good&quot;\n\nThat is testimony enough for me!\n\nanyone that has even a slight problem with your am reception which I \nconsider to be the best band to use. you have to get one of these.\n\nJust go to ebay and search SELECT-A-TENNA it cost me 52.00 with \ndelivery. to me it&#39;s priceless.\n\nBruce"}
