I take everyone's research with a grain of salt, but I also don't 
assume they are lying if it doesn't agree with the Hollywood version of 
the paranormal, or the few that proclaim they have all the answers and 
knowledge. 

All this serious researcher stuff is just blowing smoke, and BS. 

These messages/voices/images mostly are for the individual doing the 
work, they almost never can be applied to anything universal, such as 
the absolute truth some seem to seek. The only purpose of this work is 
to prove to the individual that life is unending.
