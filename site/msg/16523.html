Thanks Zack.=C2=A0 So how do you see not asking it questions squaring with =
Frank's comment of "It's not the device, it's the user. The messages receiv=
ed are for the
user, and rarely does anyone hear the same thing as the orig=
inal
listener."

Does that mean two people can't use it together?=C2=A0 How=
 would they know which the message was for if they do?=C2=A0 Or is it best =
to only use it alone?

I also believe you do not need to ask any questions at all - just let the b=

Perhaps I am not being clear.=
=C2=A0 I am not asking how it works.=C2=A0 I am asking what you claim it do=

For example, from your statements below, I get:

"The Frank's box allo=

Can you be any more specific as to what you mean by 'e=
ntities'?
Also, can the user be defined as the person asking the box questi=
ons?
