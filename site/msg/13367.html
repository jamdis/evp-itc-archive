That is the one.=A0 247 pages is the one that includes the Spiritual Realm=
.

Just make sure that it really has 247.=A0 A couple of sellers said 247 j=
ust because they got the info from some database.=A0 Have them double check=
 the number of pages.

I found the book.

1922.

Obviously a 61 year old book is a bit fragile so I'll start trying t=
