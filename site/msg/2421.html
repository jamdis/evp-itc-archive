How much will it cost to fix your little dog=
?  Certainly we all can kick in
a few bucks to help you; you've been more t=
han generous with your sharing of
your research  and  boxes.  Give us a fig=

Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] So is this proof-ative?

A trip to the v=
et will answer that question, usually most breaks can be set
unless there i=
s another underlying problem. It is a cute lil dog, sometimes
they are very=
 fragile bone structures because of breeding. There are a few
small dogs th=
at seem to have alot of problems with bad backs and breaking
legs/feet. 

 =


I think its proof to those who want it, and as for me...nobody is talking=

about me on the radio, or using my full name...so it definitely gets my
at=
tention when my name is being used in context with things that are going
on=
 around me or happening to people I know.

 

I dont need any proof, they j=
ust give it freely so I can share or in some
cases not share with everyone.=


 

I stopped lookin for proof right about the time this all started. My f=
irst
evp was all that I needed to get me on this path. My mothers voice, so=
 long
after shes been passed, friends, relatives, or even perfect strangers=
 who I
had no clue about until I found out after the fact....way too many p=
roofs
have been freely given to me, and I never asked for one. Earl and Bob=
 Cox, I
think thats one of my favorite WOW moments, not knowing about Erlan=
d Babcock
it was an easy misunderstanding. Luckily I make everything phonet=
ic so it
was easy to catch later. I have listened to others evp from him si=
nce then
and I often STILL hear earl and bob cox. They have also given me n=
ames of
workers on this side who I have bumped into later tho I usually put=
 off
contacting anyone they mention until I think the time is right. Usuall=
y it
is just weird to find out its a REAL LIVE person and that they just ha=
ppen
to be in the EVP/ITC field. 

 

I used to always assume when they say=
 a name they are talking about spirits
there. Or that if I get an ITC image=
 its a spirit face. They proved thats a
wrong assumption on several occasio=
ns. Probably the only time I ever asked
for anything was while doing an itc=
 session, after so many faces I just
wanted them to show me something else,=
 anything else, "show me something
different" led to a few portraits of the=
 living.

 

Sometimes they speak the truth, sometimes a wayward thought cr=
eeps threw
that shouldnt (or just a creep)... as for the dog...take it to t=
he vet and
see what they can do then you will know more.
