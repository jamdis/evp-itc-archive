As They have not arrived and will not\n&gt; arrive until at least OCT 4th (Bill is backed up with orders.) I can&#39;t\n&gt; comment on how well either of them work yet. I will as soon as they\n&gt; get here. I say hey try them out... if they don&#39;t work for you\n&gt; somebody will buy them off ebay. It would beat having to wait for\n&gt; months till Bill can get some more made.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Alex \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;juswitchy&quot; &lt;Alwaysguess@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Was jus wondering what you all thought of the Ovilus and the puck? I \n&gt; &gt; was really thinking of buying one and was jus looking for feed\nback or \n&gt; &gt; a tip on something better..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Blessed Be\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jus~Witchy\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\nThere are  both good instruments to have. The Puck with a Box running\nis a nice experiment to conduct to see how much they correlate to each\nother. The Ovilus can also work as a real time communication device\nwhich is great. I&#39;ve just started putting them to work and I&#39;m quite\npleased. -Bill M"}
