Yay I finally get my bike pic. Cept you still owe me the one of you wheeling around on one LOL
   
  Now how did I know it would be THAT color? =) Very nice Frank you did a great job on it. I saw the instructions for the recumbents before and it made pretty good sense especially if you have no fear of welding to add on extra features.

trouble with knowing how to do stuff, there's no off time! Does this 
beginning instructions make any sense?
