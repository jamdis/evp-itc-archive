Yeah a few do help clear the static or bring out the static voices better. Heres another free one you can try out called UCL Enhance. It was successful on some of my evp enhancement but not all. Its a program created by the Dept. of Phonetics and Linguistics at University College London to enhance selective sections of the speech signal based on thier phonetic properties. 
   
  http://misty.xm.com/software.html  has software links for you if you wanna try it.
   
  Since I go phonteically I thought I would see if it was something that could be used in a way they hadnt intended. It worked on some, just that it picks up some evp tone speech better than others. For instance in one h2o evp I used it on there was a male and female speaking, her voice was cleared remarkably, his was mangled and a third voice was uncovered that I didnt know was in it.
   
  Overall I like clear voice better. Plus no errors when processing. UCL enhance is still in beta test production and they are studying human speech patterns and frequencies, not evp speech patterns. It has alot of errors while processing sometimes you have to do it again and again until it will complete and its kind of slow. But if they ever do any updates on it I would love to be in line to test that out just to see if it has any relevance for our research. 
   
  As technology increases perhaps more will become available that can enhance some things for us.

          Ron,
 
I have not heard of any voice recognition systems that would enable you to recognise
a recorded evp from a box or traditional.
I believe the simple reason being that evp's that come from any type of box we use today run on the same
principle, the words are created by the entities using random bits of radio signal or pieces of radio chatter 
that is being scanned by the box.
 
Traditional evp is based on the theory that the spirit leaving the message uses the ambient energy in the surrounding area
and manipulates it into words that are captured by the recorder.
 
both of these methods are very monotone is essence the box replies are made up of different word fragments and not fluid enough.
The traditional evp message sounds very whispered or pitchy and is filled with white noise and recorder static.
 
The voice recognition software being used today is like misty said very expensive and is designed to recognise the inflections in human speech
it is mainly used by forensic labs to determine if two speech patterns are the same.
 
My opinion is that the software would not be capable of detecting evp messages, I have not personally tried it but had the idea many moons ago
and researched the possibility.

Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Voice Recognition techniques

        Theres some great software out there. Problem is the really good ones have big price tags. Id have to use them before I could comment on them. Clear Voice Denoiser works pretty well for me and what I do. Ive been using it almost from the start along with the p1 filter for all my water sessions. It's become part of my standard practice. The p1 helps bring the voices out without destroying the other noise.. or it can destroy most of the noise, its up to you and your settings. Clear voice free demo works on all clips under 30 seconds which is fine for most evp work. I liked the program enough I bought it to support thier work. 
   
  Heres one from last night, may hear her maybe not. LOL but at least ya can see the before and after results of filtered or unfiltered and how CV raises the voice level. It works especially well for the -74 speed voices, gives them a giant boost in tone levels. Not so whispery.
   
  This one is just normal speed, as recorded.

        Bruce's test with unlabeled messages brings up a question I have about howEVP-ITC@ yahoogroups.com to better decipher what is being said on the other side (particularly for those of us who can't hear too well).  Is there a computer Voice Recognition system that can be used.
   
  On this subject, I recently saw a video on  AOL about a secret sentence that actor Bill Murray mumbled at the very end of a movie...don't recall the name of the movie.  Technicians somehow processed the sound to make the message VERY clear and precise.  Even I could understand the sentence.   In the program you could hear the stepped improvements of the signal till it was stepped up to the point of clarity.  Would that be possible or even useful for EVPs??  If so, how could I do that?????   Ron L
