To list \nit \n&gt; it is $1.00 for $25.00-449.00 plus 8.75% of the initial $25.00 \n&gt; ($2.19), plus 3.50% of the remaining closing value balance ($25.01 \n&gt; to $1,000.00)\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; I would be willing to list the one I have plus give the \ninformation \n&gt; on the free hacking and that fact that you can get one at Radio \n&gt; Shack for $24.99 just to shut this guy down. At the most I would \nbe \n&gt; out $1.00 to not sell it!!!! Well worth it I&#39;d say.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can someone send me the written instructions on how to hack the 12-\n&gt; 249.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kay\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Either that, or anyone willing to make them for $25 + shipping \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; no profit?  You could then list them just like the ones that are \n&gt; &gt; selling...so they pull up identical to the listings that are up \n&gt; &gt; there.  :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking if someone would list a FREE DOWNLOAD of \n&gt; &gt; instructions for the various hacks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the Radio Shack units, it could put an end to the business \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; sellers that are taking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of people who are unaware that they could probably \n&gt; hack \n&gt; &gt; the units for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen &quot;downloads&quot; of various things listed before.
