<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have done this myself and heard EVP from many historic sites that  
seem to relate directly to the events that happened there. I&#x27;ve heard  
multiple session tapes from Chris Moon using the box Frank gave him,  
recorded at various sites such as school dorms, Eastern State prison,  
etc., and the messages that come through seem to be consistent with  
the kinds of inhabitants one would expect. When I get my mini, I am  
going to take to sites such as Antietam and see what comes through.

If you want, Juli, I can try to send you some links of interesting  
EVP samples I have heard that were captured within a historic context.

&gt; Anne, I was wondering if you or the others could shed some light on  
&gt; validations received.  I have been conducting conventional EVP for  
&gt; sometime now and have utilized it for many areas.  I believe that  
&gt; (and this is only my theory) that you can capture EVP anywhere  
&gt; using just a regular recorder.  In doing historical research on the  
&gt; answers provided by the other side, I have in some cases been able  
&gt; to validate the responses given using the conventional method,  
&gt; backing it up with periodicals.   Since I have only conducted 2  
&gt; test sessions with the hacked, I was curious as to those have been  
&gt; doing this for a while been able to confirm some of responses  
&gt; received?  I know Bruce confirmed that the other side knew what  
&gt; they where doing by cleaning out his daughters room, but I was  
&gt; curious as to historical facts or things of importance.
&gt;
&gt; The reason why I am asking is the first 2 sessions I asked direct  
&gt; questions pertaining to reports I had which was confirmed and never  
&gt; expected to received the responses I did in detail knowing that  
&gt; they were in fact true.  Have you or anyone ran any experiments in  
&gt; their sessions to see if they are consistent in proving facts or  
&gt; predictions that have come true?

&gt;&gt;&gt; As you may have notices from the previous discussion, I don&#x27;t  
&gt;&gt;&gt; tend to worry about negative forces. I worry more about simple  
&gt;&gt;&gt; human/nonhuman identity thieves. Hell, Lance--it&#x27;s all in the  
&gt;&gt;&gt; phrasing, isn&#x27;t? If I want to hear from my Nanny, I&#x27;d like it to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey Ann,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m totally on the same page about finding out the truth,  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whatever it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may be. I know there are tricksters. Native Americans call them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Coyote or Skinwalkers.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; From the clear voices and degree of two-way dialog, for me it&#x27;s
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simply about getting straight answers. I&#x27;m planning to try and be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rigorous about testing any spirits or whatever they are before
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proceeding. The last thing I wish to do is entertain some demon or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entity that is all about lying and half-truths.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; But it must raise questions, mustn&#x27;t it, Bruce? Who are these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; entities we are talking to and why would it be such a problem for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; us
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to know who they were in life? If these are dead humans, it can&#x27;t
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; how it would make any difference at all. In fact, to me, being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; able
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to talk about human things with them is rather the only way to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prove
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; that they are dead humans. It does concern me that these entities
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; not human, not because I would particularly care if they were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; extraterrestrial or extradimentional and just admitted that, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; because my personal desire is to talk to people like me who have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; crossed over.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Can you ask them to give you some sort of reason why they can&#x27;t
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tell
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; you more about themselves?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, my 2 cents. I know that my line of inquiry with the box is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; going to be directed at people who have crossed. Maybe I&#x27;ll get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; answers of my own shortly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What I get from mike &amp; Lisa when I ask personal questions about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; them is a reluctant answer at best.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I have already thought to ask all of the questions you mention
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; more and have been answered with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;NO&quot; &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; and things like &quot;Wait&quot; so I&#x27;m assuming that they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; either not allowed or are not ready for me to find
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; out about their physical lives. I also get the impression that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; want to remain as separate entities in my mind
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and if I where to know who and what they where in the physical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; would reduce them to a lower level of spirituality
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in my mind. that is the general jist of the messages as far as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; subject goes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Comments for Bruce
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rambling thoughts:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The sound quality was not as good with this batch. Lots more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; background. Did you change anything?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay--I am completely fascinated with who these people are who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; talk
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to us. I have two, both male, and god knows who they really  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; because one has changed identity at least six times over the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; years,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and one won&#x27;t tell anything at all about himself. Period.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; says
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that he won&#x27;t talk through the box either. I&#x27;m tempted to  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; add, &quot;So
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; there&quot; as a direct quote. LOL. Anyway, Mike and Lisa-- So Mike
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; says
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he bled to death in &#x27;95; Lisa choked to death in the 1920s and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nuts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to you for asking, apparently. ;)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Would you ask them some questions for me?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask Mike which &#x27;95 he died in--1995 or 1895?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask Lisa what her favorite perfume was.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask them both more biographical questions, such as where the  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; born, lived, and died. Their full names. Their spouses&#x27; names,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kids,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; etc. I&#x27;m a historian/geneologist and I think it would be a  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; blast
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; look in available records to try to identify them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask them the year of their birth. If they tell you, there&#x27;s  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; historical questions I love to ask about events within their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; lifetimes.
