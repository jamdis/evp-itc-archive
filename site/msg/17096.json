However I am lacking in electronic skills. At one time I started going to school for electronics and became very ill. I believe in the existence of a lot of things others do not. I am more experienced in sensing things.\n    My point. I want to send Frank a private email. I believe this is for him as he has had a passion for this and was the first I ever heard about doing such things. Unless Frank of course wants me to post it so all can see.\n     It has been awhile since I saw what was going on with the box. How have you changed since the original? Perhaps if you changed it a lot I do not have a message for you. I have been intrigued and went into electronics because I wanted to build my own box and add features I do not know how to add. I figure Frank probably has the knowledge."}
