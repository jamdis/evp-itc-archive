\n        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since we are also assum=\r\ning that digital recorders can pick up \n        spirits, then the simplest =\r\nexplanation is that that same up-front signal \n        (before it gets digi=\r\ntized into bits) is also being manipulated.&nbsp;

It would be interesting for someone to determine what kind \n        of =\r\nexternal EMF is needed to induce or modify a signal in the \n        pre-dig=\r\nital phase of the recording circuitry, and what side effects that \n        =\r\nwould have.&nbsp;
