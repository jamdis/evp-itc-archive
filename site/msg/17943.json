But if you feel obsessed when away, it might=\r\n be \n                    good to ask &lt;br&gt;&gt; your friends and loved ones f=\r\nor some \n                    opinions on what they see in you. Your &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; health is \n                    more important than anything here anyways,=\r\n and you can&#39;t \n                    really &lt;br&gt;&gt; do a job with interpret=\r\nation of your \n                    results, much less your other &lt;br&gt;&gt; r=\r\nesponsibilities in \n                    life, unless you put your health fi=\r\nrst.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; \n                    &lt;br&gt;&gt; --- On Fri, 7/9/10, Sno=\r\nwfireL@aol. com \n                    &lt;SnowfireL@aol. com&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; \n                    From: SnowfireL@aol. com &lt;Sno=\r\nwfireL@aol. com&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; \n                    Subject: [EVP-ITC] Last ni=\r\nghts files, [13 \n                    Attachments]&lt;br&gt;&gt; To: inside_the_bo=\r\nx_ rtsc_ghost_ \n                    box_research@ yahoogroups. com, &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups \n                    .com, RTSC@yahoogroups. com&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; Date: Friday, July 9, \n                    2010, 7:26 AM&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Well, got \n                    no response out of the =\r\nother list, let&#39;s see if any of you \n                    &lt;br&gt;&gt; folks on =\r\nthese lists can hear these at all. They \n                    may be too fas=\r\nt, but I did try &lt;br&gt;&gt; to slow them a bit, \n                    I know, =\r\nthese are very hard to hear, got them last &lt;br&gt;&gt; \n                    ni=\r\nght in response to Steve&#39;s letter about all the \n                    &quot;relig=\r\nious&quot; crap I&#39;ve &lt;br&gt;&gt; been sending, such weird \n                    file=\r\ns I sometimes send in lately. I do not control &lt;br&gt;&gt; \n                  =\r\n  what spirits say though, after all they are just people too. \n           =\r\n         Got one on &lt;br&gt;&gt; here that&#39;s really funny, I think it has \n    =\r\n                a little demon on it too, he seems &lt;br&gt;&gt; very angry, and=\r\n \n                    wants someone to &quot;Let me out! Let me out!&quot; is what he=\r\n is \n                    &lt;br&gt;&gt; saying, I think he is wanting to come aft=\r\ner some \n                    folks, because, even &lt;br&gt;&gt; demon&#39;s believe =\r\nin God. He \n                    really sounds mad at some people and wants =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; \n                    &quot;.....out,&quot; just going to let you hear it, ma=\r\ny need to play \n                    it several times to &lt;br&gt;&gt; hear, but =\r\nI think its kinda \n                    cute. I told them what some on the l=\r\nists were &lt;br&gt;&gt; \n                    saying, and this was the response. =\r\nbtw Is someone going to \n                    Florida ?
