Hi John, welcome, I do fine with the 12-470 older radio from Radio Shack,
and at ufogeek.com there's a video for the 469 as well to hack and explained
clearly!

 

Look forward to hearing your files!

Subject: [EVP-ITC] How to obtain a Frank's Box?

 

Hi Gang,

My name is John Marc Carr, president/founder of SEFGR, South East Florida
Ghost Research. I organized this group in 1998, and have been in the
research of Ghost and Paranormal happenings ever since. I'm the official
paranormal researcher for the Stranahan House which is Fort Lauderdale's
oldest and most haunted historical landmark. We have gotten many EVP's by
use of digital recorder. There are 5 intelligent haunts that are in the
house and one residual haunt outside of the house. Most of the evp work has
been handled by me, but I have been teaching some of my member to work their
own recordings.

 

I am totally fascinated by your use of the "Frank's Box". My congradulations
to your success, Frank and those who use the box on the research that you've
accomplished. In this, I'm also dissappointed by those who have used your
box to make money or notority to gain fame by it. I won't mention names, to
mention them will only give them more strength. 

 

We are currently trying to do the Radio Shack hack of the 12-469 and hope to
be successful in this trial by error. Hoping that our work will produce
something that we've been trying to accomplish like you all have, two way
communication with astral beings. It's fustrating to do digital recordings
and having to wait and sift through the recordings to get information. We
hope to elliminate that with the hack.

 

Are Frank's boxes available for retail? I've heard of the Mini Box that is
coming out soon and they are taking pre-orders for this product. Our group
is small and we don't charge for our research at the historical landmarks
that we do here in Fort Lauderdale, so we are looking for the best at the
lowest route approach.

 

Our next project is a Historical Firehouse that is haunted by the ghost of
Robert Leland Knight. There is a mystery on how he died, but legend goes
that he fallen in a water puddle that was electricfied by a downed wire. He
was a large man and a Golden Glove champ of Florida. It was his second week
of working at the firestation and he didn't have his gear because it had to
be ordered. There is some who think (psychics) that he might have been
pushed out of the firetruck as a prank that went wrong.

 

This firehouse has had media play with the Sci-fi channel in a show called
"Proof Positive". The firestation is becoming a museum, and is allowing us
to spend the night in doing an investigation about Robert. There are some
who believe that some of the haunt has to do with a hanging tree that was at
the opposite corner of the Firestation. We are excited about doing an
investigation of this Historical Landmark, but are cautious of the fact that
there will be low level spirits/astral beings that might be present.

 

Frank, If you have the time to answer me, that will be great. Those who have
the "Frank's box", if you can tell me how you obtained yours, that will be
helpful also. I would be greatful for any help at this point.

 

Thanks for letting me listen in on all of your discoveries and successes.

 

Best Regards,

John Marc Carr
