 I would think getting '66' would be meaningful since that was in your e-m=

agments. I judge what I get by personal meaning.   When the '469 tunes, the=

t. I didn't hack my 469, I use it with an external sweep voltage, so don't =
have the clicking. I also use an extenal amplifier, so don't have the sound=
 problems either. I would love to be able to do this stuff for others, but =
as with #37, that was ten hours straight just to wire the board last Saturd=

 That's the plan, to do a PCB(printed circuit board) kind of a univ=
ersal sweep/amplifier board, then I can use it with the 469, or my home mad=
e tuners.
