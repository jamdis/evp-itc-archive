I see them for sale in the thrift stores though. Guess it would kinda act like a Spiricom, where an RF signal is transmitted a short distance and the entities re-modulate it. What about using one to transmit the audio from a box? \n\n F-S\n\n  \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Fiona Broome&quot; &lt;email@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; One of my readers asked me what I thought about using a baby monitor for EVP.  Apparently there&#39;s one that gets poor reviews at Amazon because it seems to pick up voices from nowhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; That sounds like a good candidate for EVP, etc... no pun intended.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wanted to see if anyone on this list had talked about this, but Yahoo Groups&#39; search form isn&#39;t working.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has this been discussed?
