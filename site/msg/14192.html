They are not necessarily the same bytes, but I was proposing a quick check =
just to see if the files were in the same ballpark.=A0 Look at it the other=
 way: if the number of bytes were DIFFERENT, than you'd know the files HAD =
changed, and you could stop testing.=A0 But if the number of bytes are the =
same, it tends to indicate the files are likely the same, but you still nee=
d a low level file comparison to be sure.

My method is to compare the file=
s using the CMP command in unix.=A0 There are many programs to compare file=
s, but you have to be careful not to use one that does a line-by-line compa=
re (or a comparison meant for text files), since text files can be differen=
t at a low level, but look essential the same in an editor (because of the =
way spaces and tabs and new lines work between editors and platforms).

But=
 anyway, the way to compare is with a program that can compare binary files=
, not text files.

               The kind of compression that

  occurs during an email attachment is "lossless":

         it compress the file cleverly without losing 
                    =
            information.=A0 For example, if I had a

          program in some .exe files, and I sent it over

               email, it could compress it.=A0 But if it

               lost even one bit, the resulting exe file would 
           =
                     not execute again after it was uncompressed on 
      =
                          the other side.

This kind of compression 
      =
                          does things like looking for common patterns in 
=
                                the file, and replacing them with a token.=
=A0 
                                A rough example would be if it found "=
Howdy 
                                Neighbor" in a file 20 times, it cou=
ld replace 
                                all the occurances with say $HN=
1.=A0 And also 
                                write a little dictionary i=
n there someplace 
                                that says "$HN1=3DHowdy =
Neighbor".

When the 
                                file gets to its dest=
ination it can be 
                                uncompressed, and all oc=
curences of $HN1 are 
                                replaced with "Howdy =
Neighbor".=A0 So it was 
                                compressed (instea=
d of 14 characters each, it 
                                only needed 4,=
 plus the dictionary), but lost no

Some formats, like jpeg and mp3.

        the exact same contents, whether they are audio or image or a
