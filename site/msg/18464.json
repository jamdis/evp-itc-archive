Did you ever get any information on the spirit from the box or whatever you are using? Very interesting experience to read, although I imagine you find it a little more than just interesting of course. Can you let us know if the spirit returns or if there are more still there?\nThanks,\nCountry\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rick Wegrzyn &lt;rickwegrzyn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Are using the &quot;BOX&#39; or going at it with a digital recorder ????We went back to \n&gt; the cemetary and asked what followed me to follow me back...I always go for \n&gt; evp&#39;s,KII,thermal temp. guage,and video....Today is fine what ever is no longer \n&gt; here and the air is lighter,but the evp&#39;s we got are class a..there is a evil \n&gt; presence there,we were followed by a small red light ..cahght by video,kinda \n&gt; like a cigerett...I walked around and nothing...But the evp we got was a women \n&gt; saying yes to the evil one,and along with the KII hits...That box from my \n&gt; xper.brings out more than I was ready for...Thanks again Frank....love Ya,Rick\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: draiga1 &lt;mail@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Sun, August 15, 2010 4:45:58 PM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Frank / Friends\n&gt; \n&gt; Â  \n&gt; I haven&#39;t noticed that any spirits have set up house with mme because I \n&gt; communicate with them. I have spirits here already since I collect haunted \n&gt; objects, but they have gotten quiet since they&#39;ve settled in years ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~Draiga\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Country&quot; &lt;plaine@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is interesting that you posted this because I was thinking of asking the \n&gt; &gt;group if using the box, a digital recorder, EVP Maker, and the like created any \n&gt; &gt;odd occurences in your home. I have had things happen and it always seems to be \n&gt; &gt;after I have spent some time trying to communicate with one of those methods. \n&gt; &gt;Does this kind of communication bring spirits into your home? Has anyone else \n&gt; &gt;had similar experiences to Rick?\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Country\n&gt;"}
