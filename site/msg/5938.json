Let me say that you have m=\r\nany friends and associates here just for the simple fact that you have an i=\r\nnterest in ITC, are a researcher and a complex thinker. I think we have sho=\r\nwn in the past that we can have a disagreement and still remain friends. Yo=\r\nu make a lot of good points in your post and I would like to know who remov=\r\nes time from their recordings. I have never removed time from my recordings=\r\n and see no reason why anyone else would without saying so in an accompanie=\r\nd post.I have limited experience with the 12-469&#39;s as a single piece of equ=\r\nipment. I have arranged mine per Mike&#39;s, &quot;Spiricomp&quot; design. I have 3, 12-4=\r\n69&#39;s feeding a four channel mixer, which goes into a laptop running DC6 wit=\r\nh Soundsoap 2. Mine scan equally spaced on the FM band. I have had pretty g=\r\nood results until recently.At first the messages were pretty clear but I ha=\r\nd a feeling I was getting a different group than I normally have for the la=\r\nst few years. When I would ask about my friends on the other side they woul=\r\nd tell me they will look for them. Well about 2 weeks ago the 12-469 arrang=\r\nement started generating a lot of interference and feedback. I started hear=\r\ning radio static voices as I use to get with shortwave. Not voice fragments=\r\n but voices made of static (metallic and robotic). They were breaking throu=\r\ngh the sweeping. I had a feeling someone else was trying to force their way=\r\n through. Finally the interference got so bad I was forced to revert back t=\r\no a simpler method I used before, which is using fan noise. One of the firs=\r\nt messages to come across was from a familiar voice telling me and I quote,=\r\n &quot;your method sucks&quot;. I have not used the 12-469&#39;s since because of the cle=\r\nar messages I have been getting using water and fan noise. That does not me=\r\nan I have given up on the 12-469&#39;s but I won&#39;t use them again until I am pe=\r\nrsuaded to by my friends on the otherside that they are willing to use and =\r\nadapt to it. To my knowledge only Misty, Laura and myself use water for rec=\r\nording.Regards,Frank R.\n----- Original Message ----From: babiarz3 &lt;babiarz3=\r\n@...&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.comSent: Monday, January 21, 2008 9:34:0=\r\n1 AMSubject: [EVP-ITC] Babs has Issues!\n\nAlright, you all know I&#39;m vocal an=\r\nd I haven&#39;t made any &quot;friends&quot; herebut, if we can put that aside for a mome=\r\nnt...Spirit communication has been my passion since day one, a little over6=\r\n years ago. I am a believer in the afterlife and a believer inspirits attem=\r\npting to communicate with us for a variety of reasons. Ihave spiritual beli=\r\nefs that I feel strongly about and devote much ofmy waking (and sleeping) m=\r\noments to thoughts about this field.However, I am also a researcher and a s=\r\nkeptic. In order for me toallow ideas to become part of my reality I must e=\r\nxperiment. In orderfor me to believe something is paranormal I HAVE to rule=\r\n out all otherpossible causes. That being said, I have some questions. My h=\r\nope isthat there are some here willing to enter into discussion with me.I h=\r\nave a difficult time with many of the files here. Many times, thereis no qu=\r\nestion included in the file. I can not determine whether ornot the &quot;reply&quot; =\r\nis an intelligent reply. Maybe this has to do withallowable file size.Some =\r\nof the files I have been able to download. (I don&#39;t always keepmy email set=\r\ntings on for this group as I get too many - lol) When Ilook at the file I s=\r\nee problems. There will be complete flat linesilence between the words. Man=\r\ny times the &quot;reply&quot; is also at the samedecibel as the question askers voice=\r\n. Those two things should notoccur naturally considering the devices being =\r\nused. That tells me thatthere is manipulation of the files. Now, what is ma=\r\nnipulation to me,may not be manipulation to others. To me, any altering of =\r\nthe recordedfile constitutes manipulation. I do not know if the reply wasin=\r\ntelligent or manipulated to be intelligent. Some say that they simply remov=\r\ne the &quot;no response&quot; time. I&#39;ve beentold it can be as much as 18 seconds rem=\r\noved from between words. Nowwe run into the problem of us deciding what wor=\r\nd fits in with thequestion. What words are being ignored? Did we take nonse=\r\nnse and makesense? Did we amp every noise/word or only what fit?I think it&#39;=\r\ns great that files are offered for peer review. However, Ithink we have to =\r\nload them untouched or at the very least, offerexactly what was done to the=\r\n entire file. Time elapsed between words,what was amped, etc. I&#39;d also love=\r\n to see some of these sessions videotaped with the question asker facing th=\r\ne camera and a second handclock visible. Truly, we aren&#39;t researching if we=\r\n don&#39;t have someprotocol in place.Here is an issue I have with the RS Hacks=\r\n. I have the 469. It takesapproximately 18 seconds to scan through the AM f=\r\nrequencies. Now, thetypical person would think that we can take that 18 sec=\r\nonds and divideit by the number of AM stations to determine how long we are=\r\n on eachstation before moving on to the next one. In that way we coulddeter=\r\nmine what is impossible to be said via a radio fragment. However,that&#39;s not=\r\n correct. The scan cycle can vary from one frequency to thenext and of cour=\r\nse the biggest problem is that some stations arepicked up over multiple fre=\r\nquencies; AM 640 can be heard on 630, 640,650, 660 and maybe even 670. That=\r\n extends the time a great deal. Thisis a difficult problem because it is al=\r\nmost impossible for the averageperson to be able to make a determination on=\r\n time this way. I heard about the following today; An experimenter records =\r\nat the sametime every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importance of meditati=\r\nng,automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but what we have torem=\r\nember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning into the sameradio sh=\r\now every day. One of my first experiments with the 469 had mehearing this d=\r\neep male voice over and over again. What was he tryingto tell me, I wondere=\r\nd. Than I realized that he was speakingapproximately every 18 seconds; ever=\r\ny time the scan hit that station.So, if you are removing up to 18 seconds b=\r\netween words, then you arereally only recording the words from one station.=\r\n This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides discussionabout so=\r\nme research problems. I know that there are those who are notconcerned with=\r\n anything more than the communication itself but I thinkthat it is of the u=\r\ntmost importance to attempt to factor in someprotocol in order for this to =\r\nbe considered serious research at all. \n\nLooking for last minute shopping d=\r\neals?
