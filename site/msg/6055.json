I&#39;ve never seen the whole show online .. We all sat in a \ncircle (Me, Jeffrey Wands, my Team, and the Producers) .. We asked \nquestions and recorded in complete silence and also as Jeffrey was \nspeaking and so much of what Jeffrey said was validated in the Evp \nrecordings.  We had over fifty Evp&#39;s. The exciting part is that Maury \ndoesn&#39;t sound skeptical anymore .. \n\nJust a small part of what went on was featured in the show ... One of \nthe other segments had a little boy who sees a girl spirit who plays \nwith the toys in his room.  I was speaking to him backstage and his \nstories were amazing!  He can&#39;t wait to move.  \n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Debbie--will the show be available in its entirety online?
