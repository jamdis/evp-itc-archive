Lori, if somone got the number right, then I suppose I could not be sure wh=
ether it was from a third-party spirit, or a telepathic communication.=C2=
=A0 So if someone got it right, that would then suggest a second layer of t=
esting.=C2=A0 But unless someone gets past the basic first test (getting it=
 right), I don't think that's an issue to worry about yet.

I'll pose this question to your test.=C2=A0 How do you know the=
 person is receiving information from a third-party spirit and not a telepa=
thic connection to you?

=C2=A0

When I was teaching psychic classes I prin=

s.=C2=A0 I would then wouldn't know which one they had and there were far m=
ore then students so ...=C2=A0 And some weren't even pictures, simply a sin=
gle color square.

=C2=A0

This would make a true blind test and elimate th=
e "telepathic" connection theory.

You=C2=A0could do=C2=A0the same =
with your number, just write bunch down pull one from random and set it up =

If anyone feels like calibrating their board, or wants to know if they =
can get accurate information from it, I have written down a number between =
1 and a billion (1,000,000,000)

Let me know what your board thinks it is. =

If it gets it correct, sounds like you've got something important going on=
 there!

If it can't get it correct, I suppose that brings into suspect all=
