We&#39;re only now seeing it.\n\nWormholes may provide us with exceptions.  Black holes may be deterrents in how quickly (if ever) we perceive things here.\n\nIt&#39;s wild stuff, isn&#39;t it!  I often call this &quot;pretzel logic&quot; because I so often have to wrap my brain into (illogical?) twists so this makes sense to me.\n\nMost of the time, I have to pause and think it through, or sketch it on paper so I have a visual understanding of the concepts.\n\nCheerfully,\nFiona\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;draiga1&quot; &lt;blackwing@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Fiona,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry to butt in, but I&#39;m curious. If this is happening 500 Light Years away from us, doesn&#39;t that mean it will be visible to us in 500 years? I know that there is a delay with sound such as thunder, then the delay before an individual hears it depending on how far they are from where the sound originated. Wouldn&#39;t it be the same with light?\n&gt; \n&gt; ~Draiga\n&gt;"}
