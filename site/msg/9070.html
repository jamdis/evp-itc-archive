<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve,

I have to admit that I&#x27;ve had problems to hear the same as you did - but
perhaps this is a matter of language. Some I heard different, e.g.
instead of &quot;here_it&#x27;s_tough&quot;, I heard &quot;urkel gets some doubt&quot;. :)

But nevertheless, I think this is an interesting method, since it
involves the experimenter into the EVP creation process.

&gt; I figured i would do an introduction for those who don&#x27;t know about the 
&gt; program.  Sound Soap is a manual tuning method to an audio file.  It 
&gt; has a bar on the bottom that can be manually moved by the user with the 
&gt; mouse.  What i did today was experiment with Stefan&#x27;s Allophone file 
&gt; into the Sound Soap program and manual sweep the audible tones.  I 
&gt; think this may be the best files i ever got so far, please listen and 
&gt; let me know what you guys think.  These files were from a 3 min. 
&gt; session with minimal editing.  I&#x27;ve had this program for months and 
&gt; never used it, i think Bruce gave it to me.

&gt; -Steve H.</pre>
