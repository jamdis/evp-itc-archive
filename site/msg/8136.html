<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think it went well.  Its a work in progress cuz right now Im digi 
recorderless but Im using my mic hooked into my pc and the 12-470 
sittin next to it...it was either not loud enuff to hear anything or 
the 470 was way too loud and ya couldnt hear me at times lol. But Im 
gonna work on that for sure.  I did get some good responses tho and 
could even hear them while I was recording and heard a cpl when i 
played it back...and if I can figure out how to clip them from the huge 
file, on Goldwave, then I&#x27;ll post them to here. 

It took all my umph not to turn it on again and sit and listen and ask 
questions...I think I may be one of those people who take this into the 
closet to listen at night so I dont wake anyone hehehe

I do have a question....which do you think is best...mp3 file or a wav 
file?  

Thanks and Hope everyone had a wonderful Easter!
