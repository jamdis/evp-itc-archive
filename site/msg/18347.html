=
=C2=A0 
You asked several questions, so I'll take them one at a time:

1) y=
ou hope what? that i made a fool out of myself or that i called it in or 
p=
erhaps both?=C2=A0 


I hope you called it in. Your resistance to giving th=
e police information you 
said you thought you had on a child abductor, eve=
n after several prompts, makes 
me hope you did call it in, and didn't just=
 say that to stop me from prompting 
you. I don't know of course, I am not =
there. I have no desire that you make a 
fool of yourself, but if it helps =
save a child from am abductor, I think it 
would be worth it.

2) Why don't=
 you get on the box, and do some asking? 

As I have said in the past, my e=
xperience with those boxes has shown me nothing 
paranormal yet.=C2=A0 Howe=
ver, people continue to say there is more to it than my 
experience.=C2=A0 =
And so, I am keeping an open mind and trying to examine the 
evidence you p=
rovide.

3) Why are negative people on these lists anyway. if you guys don'=
t believe in 
this type of technology, why the heck are you all here? 


If=
 I had absolulely no belief that there might be something interesting going=
 on 
with the technology, I would not have been so insistent that you give =
your 
information to the police.=C2=A0 How could a person, of good conscien=
ce, not prompt 
you to give that information to the police?=C2=A0 Again how=
 is that a negative thing 
to do?

Wouldn't the really negative thing be to=
 ignore it?

I don't think you should lie to the police.  If you have information o=
n a missing child, call and tell them.  Especially if it might help ke=
ep another child safe, especially if you are wrong and they don't pick him =
up 'soon enough'.<BR><BR>--- On <B>Tue, 7/27/10, SnowfireL@aol. com <I><=
