I did several long sessions with April & Allen\nSlaughter (one with Mark Macy, too) at The Stanley Hotel in mid-Nov. \n-- that was the Mini&#39;s debut.  I ordered one & got the first one\navailable, which was delivered to me two weeks later on the Queen Mary\nat another TAPS event.  The ship was bad for reception, but April & I\nwere able to go offsite to test it out.  Then I had a couple of days\nof working with it in LA.  The box is now in transit back to MD where\nI live.  So the answer is, I haven&#39;t been able to do a lot of\nstructured sessions yet.  Probably won&#39;t happen much before Jan., as I\nam away now most of Dec.  I would like to coordinate some blinds or\ndouble blinds with other people.\n\nThe FB, which I have had since June, has seen more work.\n\nRosemary\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Lance Oliver&quot; &lt;orbhunterx@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks Rosemary!\n&gt; \n&gt; ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, have you had time to do any other communication sessions with \n&gt; your new MiniBox? \n&gt; \n&gt; Elaborating on the voice quality improvements with the MiniBox, and \n&gt; other positive results of your own, should be a big help to others \n&gt; deciding whether or not to grab one for their own experimentation. \n&gt; \n&gt; Since I personally know Ron, his thoughts, workmanship, ect... I&#39;ve \n&gt; been sold on any concept of ITC equipment he might create since \n&gt; carrying own discussions for years running.

Ron&#39;s personally going to be bringing to \n&gt; my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; new Mini to the DAPS group meeting next Tuesday!! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve heard such positive feedback, from him and others, I can&#39;t \n&gt; wait \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to start experimenting. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As positive communications with the Mini are established, I&#39;ll \n&gt; make \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sure other researchers are in the loop. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lance \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;April Slaughter&quot; &lt;aprilrebuilt@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the specs side, the MiniBox has controls for both scan rate \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as sensitivity, so you can cut down on the amount of random \n&gt; noise \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also find a speed which seems clearer, whereas you cannot with \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; RS\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hack (as far as I know). The rechargeable battery lasts about \n&gt; 40-50\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hours on one charge... nothing to replace that way. It has both \n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speaker output and one for a recorder so you can not only hear \n&gt; it as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loud as you like, but you can directly record your session from \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; box.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When it comes to audible differences, the quality of the \n&gt; electronics\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used provides clearer sound. I am not straining so much to hear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things. It is just speculation on my part, but it seems to take \n&gt; less\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time and less effort for communication from the other side to \n&gt; come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through with the Mini. At least, in my experiences with both \n&gt; &gt; &gt; devices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though, I have gotten snippets from the RS Hack that were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; impressive.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ~April \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi April   Can you be more specific on the &quot;marked \n&gt; differences&quot;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ron\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
