I \nreally appreciate you taking the time to listen, and for the \ncomments, especially noting the dual layers of speech.  Interesting.  \n     Frank S. - Thanks for the recent files from EVPmaker - nice!  \nThere hasn&#39;t been much discussion regarding EVPmaker lately, so I \nwasn&#39;t&#39; sure if it was a viable tool to use.  I haven&#39;t read many \nolder posts, but hope to get caught up during the holidays.  Have you \nor others considered modifying speech synthesis software to generate \nrandom sounds?  I wonder how something like that would work\n   On the 16th I did three 3minute recordings and got 9 clips from \nthem.  In this session, I was asking questions regarding a knocking \nsound I heard while going to sleep or waking up about 12 years ago.  \nMy life situation wasn&#39;t the best at that time.  It was always three \nknocks, and once a doorbell, but not the doorbell for where I was \nthen living.  Started the Knocking session by telling &quot;Rick&quot; that I \ngot messages from previous session, got &quot;Well, he&#39;s got patience!&quot; \nfor response.  Then was told, &quot;Aye, it smells in here.&quot;  Next asked \nthem what sound did I hear back then, and got &quot;it was knocking (maybe \nnothing?)&quot;    The best one so far is; &quot;Our earthbound forefathers are \nvideo programs.&quot;  A second voice keeps repeating &quot;Ent&quot; syllable \nduring this one.  I have put these files in a new folder called \nKnocking, which is under Laptop MP3s.   More comments there.  \n\tI&#39;m making progress on getting the software needed to do \nlinear scanning with the Radio Shark 2 USB am/fm radio and hope to \nhave it up and running within the next week or two.  \nThanks again to all\nWilly"}
