That&#39;s interesting about the orbs.\n\n~Draiga\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Country&quot; &lt;countrybumpkin1956@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello....\n&gt; I, too, have a Moditronics UV/IR Full Spectrum HD Camcorder and a Moditronics Deep IR Still Camera (made by SVP). I agree that the camcorder is incorrectly named as it is not full spectrum. It is the UV and IR fields I am interested in anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both are made from low quality, in my opinion, cameras. But whatever the technology this company uses in their units is very good, and I have yet to see it duplicated. Their deep IR still camera will not pick up dust orbs, for example. When you get an orb on the still camera, chances are it is something...they are often self illuminating, solid or near solid white, often have a tail. I have also gotten very, very few orbs using this camera as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did buy this same SVP camera but modified by a different equipment supplier on the internet. It does show every dust orb there is, the picture quality is a bit blurry or fuzzy many times. I was very disappointed.\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing about the SVP still camera is if you drop it, even once, you will have a broken SD card slot. I was sold one on Ebay from someone who knew the SD card was broken and never revealed it. Some research showed me what the possible reason was...it cannot take a drop. So handle it with care. Their packing slip even says they will not warrant the camera against drops. But you probably won&#39;t find that advertised on their web site though.\n&gt; \n&gt; I found it interesting and somewhat amusing that Ghost Hunters on tv showed up with this equipment in their series. However the Moditronics label was ripped off, the glue was still on the camera and there was a zoom in to this portion of one of the cameras.\n&gt; \n&gt; In regards to the spectercams, in this economy and with the infrequency that I investigate, I cannot justify spending what any of the spectercams go for. If I were going out to investigate every week or every other week, then sure I could justify spending more money. But I would be nervous without having more reviews from users and especially those that have caught something on the Spectercam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt; CB\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;draiga1&quot; &lt;mail@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Thank you so much, Sharon. I was hoping someone had the moditronics camera too. It sounds like it works great for what I want. I appreciate you sharing your results with it.\n&gt; \n&gt;  From my experience with all kinds of cameras, I say it&#39;s best to experiment.  On one of my experiments, I went to a purported haunted alley and took 4 different shots using 4 different cameras from the same angle, taking the photos one after the other within a minute&#39;s span.  The 4 cameras I used were:  1.  Moditronics&#39; so-called &quot;Full Spectrum&quot; (which I&#39;ve dubbed &quot;Duo-Spectrum&quot; because it only sees into the near UV and IR spectrums, excluding the visible spectrum altogether) and 2.  Moditronics &quot;Deep IR&quot; which only sees into the IR spectrum, excluding the visible and UV spectrums,   \n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Sharon from SF\n&gt;"}
