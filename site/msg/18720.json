I have created a Face Book titled &quot;The Worldwide Radio Sweep EVP Alliance&quot; with intent to create a fan base for our cause, a place where newcomers can access our yahoo sites from the wall or discussions view, and through fan base membership get a feeling for how many of us actually exist worldwide.\n\nIn conversation with many FB friends, mostly of the paranormal investigation group, most of these groups do not believe in nor use Radio Sweep technology during their investigations. \n\nParanormal meetup groups around the country are popping up with intent to teach the general public how to perform an investigation using cameras and recorders, but again they tend to leave out Radio Sweep as a usable device.\n\nWe have a valuable tool that we know can and does bring in paranormal messages, but I am in belief that these paranormal groups as well as the likes of AAEVP or like organizations are keeping our work hidden away from individuals that would benefit from it, as well as have the intelect and electronic backgrounds to get in the trenches with us to move our work into mainstream.\n\nSetting up this alliance fan page is a start, and I welcome each of you to join and post your web pages under discussion, so any newcomers can join your groups and perhaps become part of our cause.\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=102193593178906&v=app_2373072738&ref=mf#!/group.php?gid=102193593178906&v=wall&ref=mf\n\nMichael Edwards SDWR."}
