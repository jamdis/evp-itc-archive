Robin, I\n&gt; am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; glad to hear that the protection ritual will be utilized by you\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the purpose it was intended. To give any individual that wants\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anopportunity to use it. You will find many forms of\n&gt; interaction\n&gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this group, running the gamut from total agreement to calm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; debate /discussion. To full blown arguments. That is what makes\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; group, If everyone followed one single ideology and the ideas\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; single person without questionit would not be a group it would\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cult. Welcome to the wonderful world of box research robin, I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; sure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you will be a valued member and researcher in this community.\n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: MudPuddleFarm@: Thu, 17 Jan 2008 22:38:57 -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 0800Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate--Bruce\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I\n&gt; &gt; absolutely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe in the power of prayer, the power of positivity, and\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power of ritual. When I first started recording EVP a couple of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; years ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or\n&gt; &gt; distressed. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will ask again: What physical or psychic harm is a disembodied\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entity capable of doing? Please listen to the one EVP I&#39;ve\n&gt; posted\n&gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this board and tell me what, if anything, you hear. I know what\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; response that has created the determination in me to continue\n&gt; &gt; &gt; researching the unknown.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings. I only want to learn\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on\n&gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; board. It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; past, and that&#39;s about all I can say. I will probably use one\n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract\n&gt; &gt; &gt; goodness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, thank you for this contribution. I think the debate has\n&gt; &gt; been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an excellent one, and I&#39;ve appreciated the opportunity to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enlightened.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: bhali333\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 16, 2008 8:06 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I swore I would not get wraped up in this debateBUT!The\n&gt; reason\n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; came up with this whole protection ritual was that some of the\n&gt; &gt; new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; researchers whereexpressing a rational concern for negative\n&gt; &gt; responces\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that they were recieving through thier boxes.The short\n&gt; protection\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ritual that I posted is not meant to quell irrational\n&gt; histerical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fear, and I agreewith rosemary that anyone suffering from such\n&gt; &gt; fear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; should rethink thier involment in the paranormal research\n&gt; &gt; field.that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal comfort\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; those new individuals that had never expperienced spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; negativity. And to help ease them into aproaching a session\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually with confidenceand determination as well as full\n&gt; &gt; &gt; curiousity for all types of the communication we recieve.My\n&gt; &gt; initial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; post of the ritual file was done with the best of intentions\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meant to be another tool available for those who felt they\n&gt; needed\n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer ritual, I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think it is really worthy of all this debate.Use it, don&#39;t use\n&gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s there if you want it. Also I must say there are two kinds\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion for self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; preservation, ie the fright and flight reflex that is an\n&gt; &gt; instinctive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trait in all of us. Then you have the irrational dibilitating\n&gt; &gt; phobic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fear that can turn an individual into a frozen statue. That\n&gt; type\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fear I believe is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learned how to harness. I also believe that anyone that harbors\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; type of fear would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; case of such fear it would already be present and doing a small\n&gt; &gt; &gt; protection ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what it is, something to utilize in our box of tools like an\n&gt; emf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meter.you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the bottom\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your tool box at home that you inherited from your grandfather\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have never usedbut if you come across that odd nut that needs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tightening somedsy you will be glad you have it.Bruce\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Need to know the score, the latest news, or you need your\n&gt; &gt; Hotmail¬Æ-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get your &quot;fix&quot; Check it out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Climb to the top of the charts!
