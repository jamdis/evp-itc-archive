For example one\n\n&gt; &gt; of our members experimented with effects on the=\r\n blood , had an\n\n&gt; &gt; independent lab analyze his blood sample and it seems =\r\nlike there was a\n\n&gt; &gt; dramatic change in the bloods terrain!\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Data collected to date on reaction responses have been over the top\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n favourable.. ...\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We are finding that actual &#39;things&#39; are ha=\r\nppening, when these\n\n&gt; &gt; frequencies are simply played. Very noticeable and=\r\n dramatic effects\n\n&gt; &gt; and changes in the body, mind and environment - unli=\r\nke anything\n\n&gt; &gt; induced by any other sound (that we know of).  many people=\r\n who\n\n&gt; &gt; experimented on these frequencies report that they are unlike oth=\r\ner\n\n&gt; &gt; existing technologies such as binaural beats.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What w=\r\ne need right now however, are more volunteers who are willing\n\n&gt; &gt; to test =\r\nout our other frequencies and keep a log of their findings and\n\n&gt; &gt; report =\r\ntheir observations to our group. There is no cost required for\n\n&gt; &gt; testing=\r\n frequencies, the primary benefit to my group and I is the\n\n&gt; &gt; collection =\r\nof data.... the benefit to you, well... once you see what\n\n&gt; &gt; we are engag=\r\ned in, I think you will be more than satisfied with the\n\n&gt; &gt; experience.. .=\r\n..\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Two things important here, one is to share with you the o=\r\nbservations\n\n&gt; &gt; of our\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; group in their process of discovery in relat=\r\nion to the health\n\n&gt; &gt; related frequency track - the thought being, that yo=\r\nu are likely to\n\n&gt; &gt; not only find this intrinsically interesting and newsw=\r\northy but also\n\n&gt; &gt; inspiring. The second is to provide you with a means of=\r\n facilitating\n\n&gt; &gt; your own journey through this phenomena in the hopes you=\r\n can share\n\n&gt; &gt; your own unique findings with us.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Feel free =\r\nto view a recent post on our research forum that details\n\n&gt; &gt; how to access=\r\n this information and also various frequency tracks you\n\n&gt; &gt; can download.\n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://health. groups.yahoo. com/group/ the_sound_ of_stars/=\r\n message/8216\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Examples of recent reports by users ;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =E2=80=9CI am struck with the effects that sound has on the physical=\r\n\n\n&gt; &gt; structure. That is, especially in the subtle tissues like neurons and=\r\n\n\n&gt; &gt; synapses. Case in point, I don&#39;t hesitate in expressing myself just\n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; the way it comes out. No coloring, no bravado, no bullshit.... the\n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n endorphine level in the body went way up. I have noted from my initial\n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; listening of this freq. is that it appears to synchronize the 2\n\n&gt; &gt; hemi=\r\nspheres of the brain and thought became markedly coherent. ..\n\n&gt; &gt; perhaps =\r\nthe feeling of increased endorphine flow could be an actual\n\n&gt; &gt; increase i=\r\nn neuro- transmitter presence, particularly seratonin... . As\n\n&gt; &gt; things e=\r\nnded I was left with this feeling of balance and well being. I\n\n&gt; &gt; definit=\r\nely want to work with this sequence more. It seems to be the\n\n&gt; &gt; right one=\r\n for me currently. I probably want to post this explanation\n\n&gt; &gt; on the Yah=\r\noo site. I&#39;ll be sending my initial impressions in another\n\n&gt; &gt; email to yo=\r\nu shortly. Thanks again for this amazing opportunity.=E2=80=9D\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; =E2=80=9CThis morning I listened to kindle mind set, I have had family i=\r\nn\n\n&gt; &gt; and had not used the fequencies for a week.

There is=\r\n no cost required for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; testing frequencies, the primary benefi=\r\nt to my group and I is the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; collection of data.... the benefit=\r\n to you, well... once you see what&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; we are engaged in, I think=\r\n you will be more than satisfied with the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; experience.. ...&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Two things important here, one is to s=\r\nhare with you the observations&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of our&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grou=\r\np in their process of discovery in relation to the health&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; rel=\r\nated frequency track - the thought being, that you are likely to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; not only find this intrinsically interesting and newsworthy but also&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; inspiring. The second is to provide you with a means of facilit=\r\nating&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; your own journey through this phenomena in the hopes yo=\r\nu can share&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; your own unique findings with us.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Feel free to view a recent post on our research for=\r\num that details&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; how to access this information and also vario=\r\nus frequency tracks you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; can download.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://health=\r\n.groups.yahoo.com/group/the_sound_of_stars/message/8216&quot;&gt;http://health. gro=\r\nups.yahoo. com/group/ the_sound_ of_stars/ message/8216&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Examples of recent reports by users ;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =E2=80=9CI am struck with the effects that sound =\r\nhas on the physical&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; structure. That is, especially in the sub=\r\ntle tissues like neurons and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; synapses. Case in point, I don&#39;t=\r\n hesitate in expressing myself just&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the way it comes out. No =\r\ncoloring, no bravado, no bullshit.... the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; endorphine level in=\r\n the body went way up. I have noted from my initial&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; listening=\r\n of this freq. is that it appears to synchronize the 2&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; hemisp=\r\nheres of the brain and thought became markedly coherent. ..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; p=\r\nerhaps the feeling of increased endorphine flow could be an actual&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; increase in neuro- transmitter presence, particularly seratonin... . =\r\nAs&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; things ended I was left with this feeling of balance and w=\r\nell being. I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; definitely want to work with this sequence more.=\r\n It seems to be the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; right one for me currently. I probably wa=\r\nnt to post this explanation&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; on the Yahoo site. I&#39;ll be sendin=\r\ng my initial impressions in another&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; email to you shortly. Tha=\r\nnks again for this amazing opportunity.=E2=80=9D&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; =E2=80=9CThis morning I listened to kindle mind set, I have ha=\r\nd family in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and had not used the fequencies for a week. The f=\r\nirst sensations were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; an extreme energy from my hands I am a R=\r\neiki Master but the energy and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; heat I felt was more than I ha=\r\nd experienced before.There was a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; bubbling feeling inside my c=\r\nhest their was intense tingling of my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; chest and torso, a sens=\r\nual, sexual feel.My arms legs and feet were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; extremely warm, I=\r\n am usually cold. It felt like my blood was&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; bubbling.I had an=\r\n effervesce feeling in my mouth. My feet tingled and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; as I nwa=\r\ns laying on the chaise listening, I closed my eyes and was&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; en=\r\njoying a full color animated video like p roduction without sound.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; This is first time I have seen anything other than a magenta colored&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; flower.I listened to kindle set for about 3 hours.
