Isn&#39;t the idea of posting files \nto \n&gt; get different theories on what is heard? What are we comprehending \n&gt; in these or any other files anyway? We are just starting to break \n&gt; ground on full sentence answers, so we need to sift through them \nand \n&gt; make sense. That one about the earthquake is a great file, but what \n&gt; does it mean??? It doesn&#39;t make any sense, we have to make sense of \n&gt; these files. Whether it be in reverse, enhancing the audio or \n&gt; whatever. This is our job as researchers, while they laugh their \nass \n&gt; off on the other side watching us spend hours on the computer to \nsay \n&gt; there is going to be an earthquake somewhere that doesn&#39;t happen. \nIf \n&gt; they say &#39;Steve likes cupcakes in a tree in east asia&#39;, that&#39;s a \n&gt; great file and it will be clear. But what would it mean and what \n&gt; effect will it have on humanity.Nuff Said&#39;-Steve H.--- In EVP-\n&gt; ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s the problem, get something that is not in human awareness to \n&gt; be recognized, heard, and comprehended.
