There are also alot of BIY projects (build it yourself).\n\nMisty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ourobouros2k2&quot; &lt;ourobouros2k2@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was wondering if anyone knew of any good online electronics \ntutorials \n&gt; (schematics, building, etc...). Once upon a time I used to know how \nto \n&gt; read circuit schematics being a ham radio operator, but that was a \nvery \n&gt; long time ago. I would certainly like to refresh my knowledge and \n&gt; attempt completion of my own projects based on some of the schematics \n&gt; here. Modifying existing devices comes easy for me, but starting from \n&gt; scratch leaves me scratching my head...\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks in advance\n&gt; Andy\n&gt;"}
