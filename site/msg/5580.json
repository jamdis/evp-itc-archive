I \nhad a \n&gt; really kick butt one that I sent to TAPs.  A little girl, clear as \na \n&gt; bell but there was nothing I could do with it.  Hopefully TAPs can \ndo \n&gt; something with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, the file I put up, if you listen REALLY close when I ask a \n&gt; question there are tiny bell sounds right after the question.  I \nhave \n&gt; another almost 10 minute EVP where I left the recorder in the room, \nno \n&gt; windows or doors open and when I went in to turn it off there was a \n&gt; very strong scent of old fashioned tea rose.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone could bump up the 2nd one to see what the low voices are \n&gt; saying that would be great, drop me an e-mail.  I am a sensitive \nbut \n&gt; would love to learn how to also use some equiptment to help me out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you \n&gt; \n&gt; Saqqara\n&gt;"}
