I'm tryin to wrap my tired brain around what you just said Ken LOL
   
  I just played it over the stereo speakers I use for the pc, turned the volume down extremely low, and recorded it with the old pc mic (which has a foil cone aparatus over it which has been there for ages). 
   
  With the music it is often a problem they are way too loud. I sometimes have to turn my volume down because the loud crackle static is often more voice layers that can only be heard at lower volume.
   
  I tried using oboe music...supposedly the oboe is one of the instruments which closely replicates the human voice in sound. Not great results wise, for me. They like the guitar better. 
   
  They also like it if I sing/hum. Little known fact about me, I sometimes have musical compositions and entire songs pop into my head in an instant and it will bug me until i sing it, hum it, or write the words down....once I do then I can go on with life as usual LOL the problem is I am about as musical as I am technical. I dont play an instrument and I have never studied music so theres no way I can write down half of what I hear but I jot the words, hum the tune, whatever and get it out of my system.
   
  I have one here someplace I recorded with me singing/humming and evp/someone else doing backup and singing along with me. What that's all about I still couldn't tell you. Strange but true and kinda freakish. 
   
  Either way just try some music out guys, play it low, anything without words is preferable.
  Record and see what pops up. Make sure ya check the reverse on that file too!
   
  =)

          music is as far away from white noise as you can get.

there are no voice fragments for entities to manipulate

voice voltage is being added to voltage of music which acts as 
carrier, via some inductor or nonlinear element near input.

audio transformer turned backwards connected to input with large 
speaker on8 ohm side and put at bottom of sound confining container 
like plastic garbage can would eliminate hit-or-miss voltage 
superposition.

use a speaker for the microphone at bottom of wastebasket hook to 
low side of audio transformer. voices could be about 20 times louder

going to try it myself asap..speaker as microphone

played a short clip of Joe Satriani's "always with you always with 
me" it contains music only, no vocals. I discovered that in the first 
few seconds of the clip the voices were able to sustain a loud, 
comprehensive line of communication until Satriani kicked it into 
high gear and the guitar notes were too loud and drowned everything 
out. Some could be heard on regular playback, most could be heard 
clearer at a slowed down rate of -74% & -30%. I then did a session 
with no music. Both sessions lasted under 1 minute and both sessions 
had a yeild of about 18 clips/sentences. The difference being that 
more of the music clips were louder and clearer to understand for me 
and hopefully for you too.

Many are very loud so I recommend you lower the sound DOWN... ALOT 
til you play it once to see what volume level it has. I use stereo 
speakers so I am used to blasting my head off LOL so careful you dont 
blow a speaker or your eardrums. Even I usually turn them down 
because the level of vibration and noise may be too much for my dogs 
ears. The process I used was the same, p1 filter only, amped at +15 
which works differently depending on what comes across and what I 
used for background sound. When using music the noise level is 
definitely alot higher and you will need to lower your sound for 
those LOL

> Only sharing some of the ones I think others can hear. The music 
session had alot more than the nonmusic session. I will send a short 
clip of satriani (the first part where the voices were the best) so 
that if anyone wants to give it a try they can.
