Yes, if they're not code-protected.  Anyone have one they'd like to 

volunteer?

The chips have a program memory which comes blank when you buy them.The "code" is the representation of what is called machine language that tells the various parts of the microcontroller what to do. In this case, I imagine it increases a voltage with a certain pattern and then drops it down to zero, starting over again and repeating at a certain rate. This would produce a repetitive sweep of the radio at a certain rate when the microcontroller is hooked up to the radio correctly.It wouldn't be difficult for me to write my own program to do this with a PIC microcontroller, but if someone else has already done it, why bother?If I can't get my hands on the machine code, I'll write some myself.ZackOn Fri, 4 Jan 2008, mllejade wrote:> Frank, please let me know if you should, for whatever reason, decide> to sell that chip (to control the scan
