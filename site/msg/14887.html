<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Snowfire,

The frequencies on the RS or (radio shack) radios should be displayed on the digital window on the radio. You will notice when it is scanning the frequency is constantly changing or sweeping the band. When sweeping its not one freq you are looking for its the sum of the freqs within the tuing band.

RS as I stated above refers to the radio shack &quot;hacks&quot;. I beleive Misty recently wrote something about that. They may have been asking what model hack you have.

Regards,

Frank R.
