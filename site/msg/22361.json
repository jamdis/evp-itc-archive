This print on demand paperback book has been two years in the making, and as I told my ninety year old mother last night, I am elated I finally got it done, so she can see it before she dies.\n\nFrank Sumption, Steve Hultay, and Bruce Halliday are each mentioned throughout this book in several different chapters, more especially in Chapter One the history of radio sweep.\n\nHere is the link to Create Space to order the book: https://www.createspace.com/3997845\n\nI wrote the book primarily for two reasons. First I wanted to share with readers the process I use to listen to and transcribe recorded radio sweep EVP messages in addition to share some of my best cases, and second, I wanted to document in a published book those responsible for radio sweep.\n\nEnjoy!\nMichael Edwards"}
