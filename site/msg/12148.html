<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Jeff,

Interesting. As I said, I haven&#x27;t used one yet.

I just have a lot of suspicion about devices that generate phonemes as 
opposed to actual sounds received. I&#x27;m sure some spirits can make them 
produce messages but they could also produce something out of random 
sounds. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d be worried about. Might sort of come out like 
James Joyce&#x27;s Ulysses.
:-)

&gt; I can attest to the opposite regarding the Ovilus 1.  The last time I  used
&gt; mine it gave me full statements.  It was referring to contact someone  and
&gt; labelled them by name and told me why.  then why I did contact that  person I knew
&gt; why I was suppose to contact them.  And that person was all  the way across
&gt; the country.
&gt; The unit does work when it is given sufficient time to set up.

&gt; I haven&#x27;t treid one of those things yet, but based on the theoy of it I
&gt; suspect it is much morelikely to generate &quot;words&quot; from randomities and
&gt; things that weren&#x27;t in fact words. It wouldn&#x27;t be considered reliable
&gt; evidence by any serious researchers.
