The questions given below were just an example of the\n&gt;questions given on the charts attached to sound samples sent to\n&gt;those of us on the international listening panel over these last 2\n&gt;years. The project was just completed in December so you&#39;re no\n&gt;longer able to be a part of it (sorry).\n&gt;\n&gt;As soon as I get permission from Alec - I&#39;ll post the final report\n&gt;along with a chart and the samples for that particular chart (and a\n&gt;few others I found interesting).\n&gt;\n&gt;Good luck in your own experiments!\n&gt;\n&gt;Guy\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Suzette &lt;angel_ghost_spirit@...&gt;\n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would like to do the EVP experiment:\n&gt; &gt;   I would like to start today....I will try at\n&gt; &gt;   least 3 times to ask the following\n&gt; &gt;   questions below. I will go into 3 different\n&gt; &gt;   rooms of my house to record in each.\n&gt; &gt;   When will we hear the results of the test?\n&gt; &gt;   Will we be witten each personally on the results?\n&gt; &gt;   Or how will we know how the spirits did.\n&gt; &gt;   In the opinion of science that is!\n&gt; &gt;   Angel\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Guy &lt;yzzzguy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;           [Note: the project is complete so don&#39;t try to sign up]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Intelligence Project\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A Project involving EVP and Listening\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you have done EVP for a while you will already know whether or\n&gt; &gt; not what you say is responded to sometimes - you will already know\n&gt; &gt; if there seems to be some sort of awareness there.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You may believe this to be so, and so may I, but the world in\n&gt; &gt; general will just take this as further evidence of\n&gt; &gt; our &quot;deteriorating mental ability&quot;!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You can&#39;t prove anything - all you can do is state your firm\n&gt;belief\n&gt; &gt; and perhaps back that up with some examples which you hope don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; sound too &quot;made-up&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This project aims to deal with that situation once and for all. We\n&gt; &gt; believe in working with science rather than against it. Science is\n&gt; &gt; not our enemy, nor indeed is scepticism.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Method\n&gt; &gt; What we want to find out is if there is any relationship between\n&gt; &gt; what the experimenter says and the type of EVP responses that we\n&gt;get.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We are looking for signs of intelligence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We want to do that in a measurable way - for that is the way of\n&gt; &gt; science. And this is the way that has been approved by a major\n&gt; &gt; European pharmaceutical company for funding.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We have six questions. These questions are decided on in advance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; During the experiment the experimenter asks each of the questions,\n&gt; &gt; in turn, with a 30-second gap after each question to allow any\n&gt; &gt; responses to be recorded.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So (for example) what you would get is,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Question &#39;What is the time?&#39;\n&gt; &gt; [30 seconds delay];\n&gt; &gt; Question &#39;What is your name?&#39;\n&gt; &gt; [30 seconds delay],\n&gt; &gt; Question &#39;What do you like best?&#39;\n&gt; &gt; [30 second delay]\n&gt; &gt; and so on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now if an utterance is heard within the 30-second period and if\n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; utterance sounds as though it could be a response to the question,\n&gt; &gt; then it is treated as an actual response. For example if we hear\n&gt; &gt; the utterance &#39;John Smith&#39; seven seconds after the question &#39;What\n&gt;is\n&gt; &gt; your name?&#39; is asked, then that looks like a response to that\n&gt; &gt; question.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The experimenter carries out the session, asking each of the\n&gt; &gt; questions in turn; and then the recording of the session is turned\n&gt; &gt; over to a speech analyst.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The analyst picks out from the general background noise all the\n&gt; &gt; utterances he can find in the recording. He refines his search\n&gt; &gt; still further by selecting out the 16 utterances of the best\n&gt; &gt; quality. (sometimes it will be less than 16), and &quot;shuffles&quot; these\n&gt; &gt; so that you will not know which came first, which came second and\n&gt;so\n&gt; &gt; on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The final 16 utterances, their order shuffled, are sent out to you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What you are asked to do is decide if any of the utterances could\n&gt;be\n&gt; &gt; a response to any of the questions, and to fill in a table like\n&gt;that\n&gt; &gt; shown in the example below.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Track No. Could be a response to Question Number��..\n&gt; &gt; BR01 4\n&gt; &gt; BR02 0\n&gt; &gt; BR03 0\n&gt; &gt; BRO4 3\n&gt; &gt; BR05 1\n&gt; &gt; BR06 2\n&gt; &gt; BR07 3\n&gt; &gt; BRO8 3\n&gt; &gt; BR09 6\n&gt; &gt; BR10 0\n&gt; &gt; BR11 0\n&gt; &gt; BR12 0\n&gt; &gt; BR13 6\n&gt; &gt; BR14 5\n&gt; &gt; BR15 0\n&gt; &gt; BR16 0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As you can see some utterances are not considered to be a response\n&gt; &gt; to any of the questions, and so a &#39;0&#39; is inserted at that point.\n&gt; &gt; This is not an easy test, that is why you are being asked to help.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Please send your results to XXX@... and then they will get put\n&gt; &gt; into our database - and in time we will be told the results.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, however, preliminary results look quite promising and\n&gt; &gt; your assistance on this vital project is very much appreciated!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Guy\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Need Mail bonding?\n&gt; &gt; Go to the Yahoo!
