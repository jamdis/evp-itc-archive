&gt;  Well said April! There is a huge difference between a cynic and a
&gt; skeptic.

&gt; Healthy debate is one thing. Yes, it can be a good thing. I am not saying
&gt; don&#x27;t exchange viewpoints with people. But it is only healthy debate if both
&gt; parties are willing to consider the other&#x27;s opinion. I bet you no matter
&gt; what Frank were to say, these people would never consider a word he says.
&gt;
&gt; Just as you say, there has to be a mutual respect between parties in order
&gt; to carry on and intelligent debate, like we are doing with this discussion.
&gt;
&gt; Frank can stand up all he wants if that is want he wants to do, but for all
&gt; that, he won&#x27;t change these people&#x27;s opinions, and in the end he will only
&gt; invite more hassle from them.
&gt;
&gt; He should see that these people and their opinions don&#x27;t mean anything to
&gt; his own personal growth, research and knowledge.
&gt;
&gt; Engaging these types in petty argument just drains you of your energy.
&gt; There is no winner. It is a waste of time and energy. Energy that could have
&gt; been put to a much worthier task. It is much better to take the high road
&gt; and leave the haters to themselves.
