I thought \nmaybe there was another Mini Box available that was more money. \n\nI would love to bid on your Mini Box but I dont want to get caught \nup in the EBay freezy. I can fully understand your wanting to get \nsome of your investment back. Who knows maybe you get all your money \nback the people are bidding on it paid over $50.00 for a $24.99 \nRadio Shack radio. :)\n\n\nKay\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; A few people have seen my ebay listing and commented about the \nprice \n&gt; listed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ebay will not allow you to change a description after the item has \n&gt; been listed. They do however allow you to add and amending \nstatement.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which I have done In Big Bold Red Letters, the price listing was a \n&gt; mistake. I am certainly not trying to misrepresent the item or \nmake a \n&gt; profit on it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have also lowered the reserve price on it as a result of the \n&gt; mistake.\n&gt; Believe me I will be taking a loss on the box.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have already sent my apologies to Rick Moran from Paranormal \n&gt; systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; And now extend my apologies for the mistake to anyone that was \n&gt; interested in it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason for selling the MB was not the money, it was the guilt \nof \n&gt; having this excellent piece of equipment go without the attention \nit \n&gt; deserves. And the hopes that someone or some group can utilize it \n&gt; more than myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I could not as much as I would have liked to, give it away.\n&gt; My intention was to get back at least a decent amount of my \n&gt; investment.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope no one gets the wrong idea and thinks ill of me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;"}
