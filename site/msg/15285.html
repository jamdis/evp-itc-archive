<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, that chip was a an adjustable sweep rate for the 469.  But, i could never get it to work.  It didn&#x27;t take out the clicking, i should be so lucky.

&gt; Yeah that clicking noise is maddening Steve. Theres never a doubt when you hear it as to what they are using. Bill/Sum was sending out chips to solder into the 469 that actually got rid of that clicking but I&#x27;m not sure what it was. Frank Ratka may remember he sent him one along with others.

&gt; Steve is right tho he hasmodified much better models that sound much smoother!
