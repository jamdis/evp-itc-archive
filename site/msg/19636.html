n't no what your talking about.
=C2=A0
ok so what the point of the reply? m=
ostly to say.. I did not get the same face in the whole recording actually =
only at the end...

No, I don't t=
hink I am being too critical, but I may have expectations that are a little=
 too high. =C2=A0I want to take my time with this. =C2=A0For my own underst=
anding, I need to have a large sample size so I know not only what to expec=
t to see, but what to look for. =C2=A0I have seen ITC snapshots from progra=
ms like this that offer full faces. =C2=A0I would be more inclined to belie=
ve in such an image as opposed to, lets say. two dark lines that may or may=
 not be eyebrows. 


Even in your example of the towel, you get half a face=
. =C2=A0If you have half a face (on the vertical plane, not the horizontal)=
 you can extrapolate out what the entire face would look like. =C2=A0This i=
s something I would like to get myself and I would consider that evidence i=
f it showed up in one of these programs. =C2=A0But, if you have something t=
hat looks like a forehead and that is all there is, then it could also look=
 like a rock or some other such object.


I am certainly hoping for results=
 worked into box sessions. =C2=A0Directing a session with intent, like sayi=
ng "I am going to examine the sound waves of this communication in hopes of=
 seeing your face. =C2=A0Is it possible you can show your face to me now th=
rough sound? " is what I am after. =C2=A0If a positive hit like this happen=
s, then I will be jumping for joy. =C2=A0Another good example would be a na=
me, lets say Tom, that occurs. =C2=A0If you get a positive affirmation that=
 the name you heard is present, then you try the same technique only you ad=
dress Tom by name and get a face, that would be even better.


But, as it s=
tands now, the faces as they appear are random at best. =C2=A0I would be mo=
re inclined to believe that when these faces do occur , they are going to o=
ccur with a lesser frequency than multiple images in a few seconds of audio=
 like Ursula's example. =C2=A0If this where the case, there would be dozens=
, and possibly hundreds, of faces during a ten minute session and I just do=
n't think that is possible. =C2=A0This is why I need to look at several sam=
ples to find out if this is the case or not. =C2=A0If these partialized fac=
es occur in multiples all the time, I would be more apt to discount it. =C2=
=A0But, if they are a rarity affixed to only a few clips out of dozens, I w=
ould be more inclined to believe in them. =C2=A0Sample size is everything. =
=C2=A0It is like listening to GBC. =C2=A0If you have never done a session b=
efore, you would be inclined to believe every stray radio signal is a commu=
nication. =C2=A0Only by continued practice (expanding your sample size) can=
 you start to
 rule out stray radio with any degree of accuracy. =C2=A0


O=
n the other hand, I am very new to this and I could certainly be wrong. =C2=
=A0I will continue to plug sound into the programs and hope for the best. =
=C2=A0


I really want this to work. =C2=A0As you have probably experienced=
, when they want you to hear something or know something, they make it very=
 obvious while communicating. =C2=A0I am hoping they apply this same rigor =
to this new format to show us that they are there. =C2=A0If they can, then =
the world of video and audio ITC will merge in one source and then the skep=
tics be damned!
