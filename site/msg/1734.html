<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s funny you mentioned that.  I thought of turning them both on 
and letting them fight it out wild west style, but than i came to my 
senses and thought that was ridiculous...but funny though.  I guess 
i&#x27;ll see what happens, it may be good to get 2 different points of 
view on things.  I&#x27;ll ask one a question and than the other and meet 
somewhere in he middle on common ground.  I know they say to wash a 
Ouija board to cleanse it, but that probably wouldn&#x27;t work a piece 
of electronics equipment.  I don&#x27;t mind the cussing, but it&#x27;s just 
mean and uncalled for.  They hurt my feelings and i want them to 
apologize...lol.  I thought this would be a different angle for the 
group to branch out in and it worked.  All business and no play 
makes for a dull board, sometimes you have to mix it up and add some 
humor.  My problem is absolutely true, but not life threatening.  I 
just wanted to hear some response and i got it.

Thank you Misty,
-Steve H.

&gt; What happens when you flip them both on at the same time? LOL 
maybe they will &#x27;cancel&#x27; each other out and you will have 
two &quot;normal&quot; working boxes again. Give it a try and let me know the 
end results will ya.
&gt;    
&gt;   I have had evp where some said they prefer one method over 
another and I did get alot of neg stuff when I first started using 
evpmaker. Once I became more focused and at peace with the process 
and set a few guidelines for my sessions I find any method pretty 
much the same as another. My friends/family cussed like sailors 
anyway so for some its just language and not an attack. As for the 
ones who like to attack or play mind games, they usually get kicked 
out or interrupted after the first words they speak. It&#x27;s just one 
of the guidelines I set as well as speak one at a time with a loud 
voice if possible. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Works well for me. I gave in to a couple things in return for 
those. Cant hurt to try.

&gt; Does anybody think it&#x27;s possible to get 2 extreme opposites in 
&gt; communication? 1 Box curses at me constantly and tells me to die 
and 
&gt; also talks about the end of the world and hell. And the other one 
&gt; talks about how pretty it is there and i always get &quot;Hi&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m 
&gt; Here&quot; as well as &quot;Don&#x27;t leave&quot; when i&#x27;m signing off and an 
&gt; occasional &quot;Goodbye&quot;. Has anyone experienced anything like this 
&gt; before? The 1 box even shuts off appliances in my house when i use 
&gt; it, i guess i&#x27;ll stop using that one for now until i figure out a 
&gt; solution to what&#x27;s going on. Any ideas?????
