I had a very weird experience. If I told a psychiatrist he would shout schizo. I think people receive messages from their radio all the time, but in another way. That is advertising. But I was in the car and kept pushing the different buttons for the different radio stations. I felt like I was being communicated to. With strange gifts, perhaps I knew when to change the station. Anyways, maybe there is something to this. I am excited to work on my own projects when the house is put together and I have more funds.\n   And Snowfire, I will pray. Thank you for your kind words.\nJennifer \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; This i sabout as the car tuenr boxes get, at least for me, lost of noise.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
