Thanks for clarifying that. Hey Steve, do you think the dial or button version of the radio is better for what we do? All the best, Bill

 Although i would love to take credit for that site with the step by 
 step instructions, it's not me.  Another member posted that on here, 
 his name is Sum.  I was bored yesterday and bought a radio from 
 radio shack and did the modification in my kitchen and only took a 
 few moments to do.  I recorded a five minute session and got some 
 good files from it, so i sent it to Sum to show him that the radio 
 worked and thanked him for helping me with the mod.  He asked if he 
 could use my files on that site that he was making ghostboxhack.com  
 so i said sure.  I'm just a researcher, but after yesterday i feel i 
 can do some basic stuff with electronics now.
