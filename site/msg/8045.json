Work was long so I am trying to play catch up. I agree with you the sound is the carrier. Even in silence voices have been recorded. But I like using sound it has more energy for my sessions.\n   \n  Actually the h2o method is one of the easier methods for me. I have a standard procedure I follow and I usually only record for about 30 seconds. In that 30 seconds there may be many voices. A few in the normal range and most located in the -74 range. The number of results and clarity varies as with any method sometimes everyone hears it sometimes they hear something else or nothing at all.\n   \n  As for amount of messages coming thru, I dont record for long periods of time anymore because the sessions are more focused and easier to analyze. Just to give an average of results last few sessions I recorded amount of results varied tho\n recording time was typical @ 30 seconds. Items = number of clips of conversation. \n   \n  3-16-08  7 items\n  3-13-08 21 items\n  3-11-08 17 items\n  3-09-08 14 items\n   \n  It varies in intensity as well as clarity. I experiment with alot of stuff but its always the base method I return to because its how I recieved my first evp.\n   \n  I think in our hearing each others files alot of the differences we experience not only has to do with how we hear or percieve things has to do with what equipment we use. My speakers may sound different than someone elses so I may not always hear it exactly as they did and vice versa. In fact I am more surprised when people hear some of the words I cant quite make out and xx out hehehe. I will upload a few from recent session to files section.\n   \n  As for the diode thing..refer to the others, cant help ya there\n =) Frank R was messing with one and a few others here have used them with results.\n   \n  Misty\n\njuli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n        William, \n                   I know this was directed for Misty, but if I may I would like to also answer your question.\n   \n                   The natural back\n ground noise is used as a &quot;carrier&quot; to reveal the presence of undetectable signals in an ambient.  Misty and many others use water as a source.  I use tap water running in an ambient as the source of white noise.  Other noise sources can be used, such as  a fan, or AM radio tuned between the stations (which is also used by many on this board.) \n                     It is important to call your attention to the act that the voices are very weak, and trained ears are necessary for their identification in most cases.  It is very hard because only a few words will become clear among many minutes or hours of tape recording vs. box research.  This was in my case and I use to get completely frustrated in the process.\n   \n                      Some researchers have upgraded their systems using a germanium diode plugged into the tape recorder&#39;s microphone input (1N34 or equivalent).  The noise generated by this component, and also ambient detected radio signals, are used as well.\n   \n                      I have in the past also left a fan running as wind source, which also proved effective.\n   \n                     I applaud those who focus on this form of communication, for its a lot of hard work and in my opinion.  It takes time, and patience none of which I seem to have anymore and find the box communication more rewarding.\n   \n  Just my thoughts!\n\nWiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n        Misty\n   \n  What is the water method?\n\nMisty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n        I find some like certain methods better to make thier voice.
