Hey Rob   I heard your question repeated by the other side saying "do you have a message" voice totally different than yours and then he said "wait a minute" .  Is that what you got?  If it is...then good session...if not...then it sucks...just kidding.  Great first crack at it.  Ron L

I asked if they had a message and one second later got one! It is as
if the message was added to or on top of the am signals, not a part of
them. Please listen to it and let me know.
Rob.
