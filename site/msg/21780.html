<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That is a rather definitive proof you submitted about the existence of Jesus... lol. The world stands corrected about this basic error. lol

&gt; Its too bad that jesus doesn&#x27;t call all of you into the light for sending messages at 2am. My blackberry rings everytime some fool decides to post yet another unimportant snippet from the beyond. You all amaze me with your nonsense. Jesus could not  have called anyone into the light because he never existed. Leave amy winehouse alone, she is not related to you and not your concern. The only needy person is the one tampering with dead celebrities in the wee hours of morning trying to feel special by having something to boast about in the morning.

&gt; she needs in the light. sf

&gt; Very sorry about this one  file, I will try to shorten the file name again, 
&gt; so it will play, you just got  to read back as to what it is saying.  Which 
&gt; says, &quot;Amy, she just got in,  and she cried&quot; &quot; a pretty girl&quot; &quot;crossing 
&gt; over she cried, Jesus want her to  cross.&quot;  And the other says,  &quot;Amy, somebody 
&gt; loves you.&quot;  She  must have died feeling unloved.   sf
