Later that day the article was\nreplaced with a different article about the mini-box. I was told that\nI was stating mis truths. I wasn&#39;t. I finally was able to locate the\nmissing article. I&#39;m providing a link to the entire article along with\nthe statement regarding our children. If the link somehow becomes\nunavailable, I have done a screen shot and will provide it to whoever\nasks.\nBelieve me when I say that this isn&#39;t to cause or stir crap. I was\nbasically called a liar and this clears up that misconception. If I am\nbanned from this group for telling the truth, than so be it. \n\n&quot;...it was not the question of whether the phenomenon existed to begin\nwith, but rather what is the phenomenon.  That will require a good\ndeal more effort to explore and beginning in January we will be\nundertaking test sessions all over north and east Texas as well as\nother national locations with a wide variety of folks to see what\nhappens within the group dynamic.  The testing will include folks who\nare both believers and non-believers, skeptics, critics, other\nresearchers, children, high school students, college and grad\nstudents, and senior citizens to name a few categories.&quot;\n\nhttp://www.asup-inc.org/pages/editorial11-29-07.html\n\nAre you willing to &quot;see what happens&quot; with our children?"}
