&gt;  I&#x27;ll be the first to admit I&#x27;m no expert when it comes to ITC. The
&gt; majority of my experience comes from working with Chris (Moon) and his box
&gt; for the past 3 years. The results still never cease to amaze me!
&gt;
&gt; Anyhow, I came across this device at an estate auction. It appears to be an
&gt; antique communication device of some sort. The only verifiable information I
&gt; have is that is was probably built around 1910-1912, which is before radio
&gt; was publicly available.
&gt; (I obtained this date from researching the packaging cylinder used to build
&gt; the device.)
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have any thoughts on what it might be? I did show this device
&gt; to Chris a while back and he agreed that it probably was a communication device.
&gt; He also suggested I show it to Frank... = )
&gt; According to Chris&#x27;s box, &quot;this *IS* a communication device of historical
&gt; value.&quot; It also mentioned the device was &quot;meant specifically for me to have,
&gt; but no longer worked.&quot; There was more, but I&#x27;m trying to remain unbiased and
&gt; only use tangible evidence. However, I have little to go on.
&gt;
&gt; If anyone has any clues or can lead me in a research direction I would
&gt; appreciate it! Thanks!
