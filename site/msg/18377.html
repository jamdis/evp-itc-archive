 You asked several questions, so I'll take them one at a time:
 
 1) you ho=

at to stop me from prompting you. I don't know of course, I am not there. I=
 have no desire that you make a fool of yourself, but if it helps save a ch=

 3) Why are negative people on  these lists anyway. if you guys don't be=

 If I h=

 At least, science has terms for what they cannot see as, "dark=
 matter"  "dark energy" "atoms" "various particles" "'quarks" "electrons," =
 "neutrons: "neutrinos" "protons," "Quantum" and many other's which they  c=
laim this universe is made up of, and is held together by a force they  hav=
e no name for, it is not just gravity.  Science also acknowledges a  b=
eginning to the universe, and the fact that, energy is neither created  nor=
 destroyed, yet with a beginning, this energy had to come from some  where =
else, from some Prime Source, and perhaps outside of the universe  or insid=
e, and since there seems to be a plan, it was not a random act  by some min=
dless source, but a powerful always existing energy source,  with an intell=
igent mind, because of the complexity in the universe, it  is not some rand=
om act..  They, science do attest to that which cannot  be seen with t=
he eye, yet is still there, existing all around us. sf<br>

 3) Why are negative people on  these lists anyway. if you guys=
 don't believe in this type of technology, why the heck are you all here? <=
br>
 <br>
 If I had absolulely no belief that there might be something inte=
resting going on with the technology, I would not have been so insistent th=
at you give your information to the police.  How could a person, of go=
od conscience, not prompt you to give that information to the police? =
 Again how is that a negative thing to do?<br>
  <br>
 Wouldn't the really =
negative thing be to ignore it?<br>
