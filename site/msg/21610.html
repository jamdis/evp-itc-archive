<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Why would anyone want to do white noise shit when there is so much more advanced systems and methods available? Most work better than the box, as I ahve stated many times. Always some clown that ignores all facts and evidence!

&gt; Since the evp field has hardly evolved in the last 30 years
&gt; scientifically at least I decided to download this 
&gt; &lt;http://stores.lulu.com/evp &gt;  ebook the other day.
&gt; I realise that many of you would not know of a scientist called Alex
&gt; McCrae but instead of wandering around with a tape recorder/any device
&gt; and then postng up examples for discussion,and thinking thats cutting
&gt; edge.. he has taken the genre about 20 steps past that.
&gt; He is one of the few to use faraday cages/blind tests on subject to rule
&gt; out pareidolia/going to differernt countries and still getting evp in
&gt; his language..finding commonlaity with evp voices and the voice that
&gt; some people with some  forms of mental illness &quot;hear&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; From his site
&gt; Science Proves Spirits Exist!Science Proves Spirits Exist! You already
&gt; knew that?Cool but now no one can argue with you about it.Just
&gt; point to the EVIDENCE!With the kind permission of the Institute of
&gt; Noetic Sciences [yes, the people mentioned in Dan Brown&#x27;s book!]
&gt; retired Scottish scientist Alexander MacRae carried out a key experiment
&gt; at their laboratory in California.Read the evidence in The Portal 
&gt; Part One &lt;http://stores.lulu.com/evp &gt;  .
&gt; From the cricket noises no one is doing reel to reel work anymore here
&gt; like Sarah Estep.
&gt; Fair enough.. [:D]
