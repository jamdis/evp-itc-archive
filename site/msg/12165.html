<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I just purchased both of them. As They have not arrived and will not
arrive until at least OCT 4th (Bill is backed up with orders.) I can&#x27;t
comment on how well either of them work yet. I will as soon as they
get here. I say hey try them out... if they don&#x27;t work for you
somebody will buy them off ebay. It would beat having to wait for
months till Bill can get some more made.
