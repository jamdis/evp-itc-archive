I think I will leave the soldering of the \ncopper thingamajigs to you hehehe\n\nMisty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  So humbling to try to talk to this group with so many years \nexperience, and the intellects! Very humbling! \n&gt;  \n&gt;  If I may be so bold as the to suggest this voice is Raudive, as he \nhas a very distinctive tonal quality. Secondly, there was concerns \nthat little technical advice is received, just my small minded \nopinion, but we have the electronics, and the boxes in various forms \nwork. There is little more to this type of device, except as in this \nvoice, some minor tweaking of components.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &quot;A copper box&quot; go to Radio Shack, buy copper clad circuit board, \ncut to desired size, solder togother with gun type soldering iron (I \nthink it&#39;s 120 and 300 watts). Drill holes for mic and speaker. Of \ncourse, that&#39;s just the way I would do it. There has to be a much \nsimpler, cheaper, and better way. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Thank your for you time, sorry for the intrusion. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Source-- Box 33, on March 23, 2008.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; In a rush?
