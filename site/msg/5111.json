After I b=\r\nuild each MiniBox, my original practice was to leave it running overnight a=\r\ns a burn-in to insure that if there was an early failure, it would happen b=\r\nefore the device was shipped. After a while I noticed the Boxes would begin=\r\n cursing or calling me by name repeatedly. By then I realized that anytime =\r\nthe Box is activated, entities will attempt to communicate within a minute =\r\nor so. They seem to sense that a &#39;portal&#39; is open so crowd around and try t=\r\no get the operators attention.I have since changed my procedures and have l=\r\nimited my tests to power-up and then alignment, and indicate verbally to wh=\r\noever/whatever is present that this is a test and I am not trying to commun=\r\nicate, but to just insure that the device is working properly before sendin=\r\ng it to its new owner. The incidence of bad language has totally disappeare=\r\nd and the Box is actually remarkably quiet during this process. As I final =\r\ntest I do a very short test so confirm that communications are being made, =\r\nthen thank the entity and sign off.As I have stressed repeatedly, this devi=\r\nce, whether a MiniBox, Frank&#39;s Box, RS Hack, Joe&#39;s Box, or whatever, it NOT=\r\n a toy and should be treated with respect. Until more is known, sessions sh=\r\nould be handled with care and documented properly. I am attempting to gathe=\r\nr and rewrite my operations guidelines and welcome input from everyone. The=\r\nse guidelines are device-independent. I want to insure that all persons who=\r\n read them are using the device properly and with the correct attitude.Ron =\r\nRickettsParanormalSystems.com--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday=\r\n &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Nick,&gt; &gt; My advice as a long time=\r\n researcher is not to just turn the box on and leave it running &gt; unless yo=\r\nu intend to do a session and give your friends on the other side that are w=\r\norking&gt; extremely hard to send you the communication your undivided attenti=\r\non.&gt; &gt; It&#39;s kind of like calling someone on the phone and when they start a=\r\n conversation you decide to&gt; put the phone down and focus your attention on=\r\n other things.&gt; &gt; There are other researchers that feel that there is nothi=\r\nng wrong with this practice and do it on occasion&gt; But I have come to the u=\r\nnderstanding that it is deemed disrespectful and while you may be listening=\r\n with &gt; one ear as you do something else, you will hear a loud curse word o=\r\nr nasty statement, that is their way &gt; of getting your attention back. I ha=\r\nve gotten numerous messages about the difficulty of the attempts for &gt; them=\r\n to communicate so when I turn the box on it gets my full attention. just s=\r\nome experienced advice.&gt; &gt; As for them telling you to close the portal, it =\r\ncould have two meanings. Sometimes they refer to box that&gt; is turned on and=\r\n in use as a portal for the simple reason that each time we turn a box on t=\r\no communicate &gt; it opens a direct open link between our realm and theirs so=\r\n in essence it is an open door for anything to pass in or out.&gt; &gt; that is w=\r\nhy when I end a session I always ask my technician to bring back any spirit=\r\ns that may have come through the &gt; portal during the session and I ask for =\r\nconformation and 10 times out of ten will get &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;OK THEY ARE BACK&quot;&gt; &gt;=\r\n also they may have meant since you had the box running and where not doing=\r\n a actual session to shut the box so &gt; that they could go and not have to p=\r\nrotect the open connection from any negative entities that where able cross=\r\n through the open&gt; portal.&gt; &gt; A few researchers have been receiving numerou=\r\ns messages about the number 7 within the past month. The only known &gt; signi=\r\nficance that the number 7 has in evp research is the 7 entities that contro=\r\nlled communication back in the eighties and nineties&gt; during the spiricom a=\r\nnd luxembourg era. To receive this number in messages so often and by more =\r\nthan one researcher, odiously&gt; holds some importance which they have not be=\r\nen able or are not ready to convey.&gt; &gt; If you need any help or have any que=\r\nstions please feel free to ask.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; Bruce Halliday &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@=\r\n...: thegreatwolf@...: Tue, 8 Jan 2008 06:27:07 -0500Subject: [EVP-ITC] Box=\r\n in the morning&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey,Anyone have any odd problems in the morning wi=\r\nth using it.
