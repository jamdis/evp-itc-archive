It goes without saying that if everything is as he says, then it is pretty =
good evidence.

Paranormal means beyond normal. It means it can't be explai=
n by normal means.

      Interesting topic!

      BTW that =
investigation was at the former Manteno State Mental Hospital. It included =
the amazing "It's Harold Wing" EVP I got. None of the people doing the inve=
stigation there had ever heard of Harold Wing. Upon later examination of ol=
d records, it was found that Harold Wing was actually a patient who died th=
ere of typhoid fever in 1938. But we didn't find that out until weeks later=
.

      How do you explain that conventionally?
      :-)

          There's anoth=
er possibility: possibly the spirits involved only wish to impart sounds to=
 a particular unit or units.

          I was surprised on one investigatio=

 my belt, and my camcorder, which was in front of my face. Other people on =
the investigation didn't get them at all. Go figure!

                   =
 I believe I saw an explaination on this list about why if you have 2 recor=

                    about why if you have 2 recorders sitting si=
de by side, why 
                    may one capture an EVP on one and not =
the other? Someone was 
                    explaining about an energy fiel=
d like a bubble. <BR>I'm 
                    trying to explain this theory=
