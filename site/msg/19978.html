<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, when I saw the price it turned me off.

I don&#x27;t quite &quot;grok&quot; how the thing is supposed to work. How does it
know it&#x27;s getting an EVP?  The only way I really know of is to LISTEN.
Some of the EVP&#x27;s I and others have gotten are so close to the noise
level that it takes a little noise floor manipulation to hear them.

&gt; It looks like a cool toy, but I&#x27;m not sure it would make a whole ton of

&gt; &amp; opinions may differ, naturally.
&gt;
&gt; It seems this device is trying to establish a very loose set of &quot;controls&quot;
&gt; for capturing and validating EVP, but in my opinion this is the WRONG thing
&gt; to do in some ways...I think &quot;they&quot; need anomalies, fluctuations and
&gt; variable conditions for the best communication possible (something box-work
&gt; provides them, and abundantly at that!).
&gt;
&gt; Since working with the boxes I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to white
&gt; noise EVP and be happy; the sweeping radio is just too effective and light
&gt; years ahead of what folks were doing even just 10-12 years (and
&gt; months!) ago, I feel.
&gt;
&gt; Where the sweeping radio functions more like a proper telephone (2 way),
&gt; traditional EVP just feels like I might as well try tying two tin cans
&gt; together with a string between them and hoping for something useful or
&gt; interesting to be captured or come through.
&gt;
&gt; Box work just feels a lot more proactive and effective to me in every way,
&gt; shape and form. I can&#x27;t think of a single advantage that classical EVP
&gt; recording &amp; research has or could offer one over the boxes. The skeptics are
&gt; still going to bitch, moan and continue &quot;debunking&quot; both EVP and Ghost Box
&gt; communication either way and that&#x27;s fine with me, I don&#x27;t work for them and
&gt; I&#x27;m not trying to convince anybody, lol.
&gt;
&gt; $135.00 could get me another FLIP!  ;)

&gt;  Oh brother! Based on more of that white noise false assumption crapola. No
&gt; one gets it, you get more if you just stay home and ask them to come to you.
&gt; There seems to be a trend of moving backward in technology to the old days
&gt; of white noise EVP. But what would I know?
