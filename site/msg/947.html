thirty years ago, the voices on tape never changed, but would become clearer with time.
   
   
  i was surprised to note that the first ones i made with digital recorder changed WHILE I WAS REPLAYING THEM.  misty dawn notices same thing.  so it could be either.
   
  digital memory accentuates effect.  ie,; solid state storage RAM , flash memory, are highly susceptible to erasure or alteration by unknown energies.  400000 cosmic ray particles pass theough your hand every second.  low energy cosmic rays are main cause of RAM failure.
   
  i sort of gather that you are following up on daves linear thing .  GOOD!  next thing after that is  take a cheap AM pocket radio and set all the way down to 525 khz turn volume all the way up.  you are making a crude trf receiver with 455khz transformers.
   
   
  take a npn RF transistor and aa battery.  take any center tapped transformer.  put 
   
  +batt to center tap.  collector to one transformer lead.  emitter to neg-batt.  base to rheostat to other transformer lead--crude sawtooth generator.
   
  orient sawtooth transistor to back of radio till you get white noise then back off a little bit.
   
  put long wires from base and emitter of saw tooth transistor onto flat , non conducting table
   
  put PHOTOGRAPH OF any chemical element , like potassium or gadolinium, or any simple compound like salt., on flat area and move leads around on table with long non-conducting rod.  at some point hiss in radio will change and you will TASTE salt, potassium etc.
