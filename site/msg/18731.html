Greetings Everyone....

In search to try all methods or equipment for EVP/=
ITC, I have come
across this piece of equipment at Ebay. Could someone expl=
ain in simpler
terms what this does and how? Apparently you need your own d=
igital
recorder to record anything this picks up.

Also I noticed that this=
 the group mentioned who endorses this meter is
also the manufacturer.

Tha=
nks for your help,
Country


The E.F.P. has been tested and is commonly use=
d by the American
Paranormal Research Association, proving to be a valuable=
 tool when
conducting E.V.P. investigations

The E.F.P.'s "real time, high =
visibility" green with red
center LED display, allows others to view E.V.P.=
 responses
easily in dark locations. This feature allows users the
ability =
to capture E.V.P. evidence on video. The device
has a "white noise/ambient =
noise baseline adjustment"
allowing the user, to set the baseline level on =
the devices
illuminated scale. This provides a "visual reference" to
see in=
 real time any "addition" or "reduction" of
proprietary frequency noise. Th=
e E.F.P.'s built in circuitry
amplifies input signals to high levels allowi=
ng users to
visually monitor E.V.P. responses at higher resolution. The
inp=
ut to the device has (1) 3.5mm stereo plug used to
connect to any recording=
 devices live audio output
(earphone). The E.F.P. also has (1) 3.5mm audio =
output
which can be used for earphone or mp3 type speakers.
The E.F.P. has =
a "manual on/off switch" and built in "push
button single LED navigational =
light". The E.F.P. operates
on one standard "9volt" battery. The current re=
gulation
circuitry in the device provides hours of use.
