Very interesting, as well as this whole overunity and free energy\nstuff. The Dr. Stiffler website www.drstiffler.com seems to be closed,\nbut on http://67.76.235.52/ there are still contents online, including\nschematics of Spatial Energy Coherence (SEC) Driver Circuits. A lot of\nstuff to read... :o\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Hi Stefan,\n\n&gt; I&#39;m attaching a very basic block diagram of the system. The initial\n&gt; tones are software generated. The software is called &#39;Audio Mulch&#39;.\n&gt; The function to use is called &#39;10 Harmonics&#39;. I use a base frequency\n&gt; of 102hz. The waveform must be adjusted so the peaks are flat across\n&gt; the envelope, you will see what I mean when using the software, there\n&gt; is a free trial version of the software. The information on the SEC\n&gt; LED driver is available on Dr Stifflers web site. I do not have a link\n&gt; as the site pages seem to change frequently.\n\n&gt; Here is another example from the system\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m glad your talking...and also watching&quot;\n\n&gt; Thanks for your interest,\n&gt; Dave"}
