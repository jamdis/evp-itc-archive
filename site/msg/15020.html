Tell me where the seperation on the spectrum takes place between 300Hz and =
300KHz. Yes, soundwaves cause pressure waves that our ears read as vibratio=
n and our mind translates as sound. The waves are still on the electromagne=
tic spectrum. Even subsonic geomagnetic waves are present on the scale. Wha=
t I mean by power can be directll translated to volume or amplitude. The on=
ly thing that distinguishes soundwaves from any other wave is the fact that=
 we can hear them.

A mistake that a lot of people make is thinkin=
g that there are two different types of energy at work when it comes to sou=
nd waves and electromagnetic waves. The only thing that seperates them is f=
requency and power. Radio waves are radio waves because they occupy a certa=
in block of the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same s=
pectrum just farther down with much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic w=
aves can penetrate almost anything because of their wavelengths. The shorte=
r the wavelength the more ways we can shield against them.
=A0
Think of mic=
rowaves. These are also a type of radio and telemetry transmitting wave but=
 the waves also have a physical effect on our environment by causing molecu=
les to speed up, which creates heat. A little lower than this is IR or infr=
ared it too can cause physical objects to heat up but usually it just cause=
s molecules to rotate in place. All physical things give off IR light. Its =
a way the total system conserves energy by spontaneously emitting IR radiat=
ion.

Here is some =
food for thought. I am currently reviewing my audio from our May 30th inves=

=A0
It was me and another girl teammate=A0present in the room. I =
picked up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry with=
 me. We were standing right next to another digital video recorder that I l=

 if she picked it up.
=A0
I have long felt the true EVP does not come from =
sound waves in the environment, or then it wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodi=

=A0
This =
instance with the recorders may back that theory up. That other recorder sh=
ould have picked that voice up if it were sound waves in the environment.

I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The=A0file that is named=A0"=
01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip.=A0You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", =
and then another comes in right after that. I think I know what it says.

Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear this unti=

I have a running theory that EVP i=
s carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it =
to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrason=
ic waves that differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtract t=
hem together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, =
if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a r=
oom creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermed=
iate difference=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz =
to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates=
 ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt=
 that EVP were generated within a few inches of the recorder.
=A0
We are ab=
le to reproduce this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems =
but also with acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a commercia=
l produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
