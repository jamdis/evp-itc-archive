Steve,
  My box wasnt close to my mic really..prolly like 5 or 6 inches away.  But Im thinking that maybe its my mic picking up sounds of me leaning on my desk and even tho it isnt audible to me at the time, my mic is still able to pick it up. hahaha.  Im gonna do an experiment tonight or tomorrow to see if thats the case.  
   
  Rhonda

          Rhonda,

I heard it, but i've had a similar sound in one of my recordings 
too. I realized that my recorder while holding it close to the 
speaker actually was brushing up against it creating a similar 
sound. Was you recorder close to the speaker where that could have 
happened? Just something that has happened to me in the past.
