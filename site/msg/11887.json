There are spirits who have  \n&gt; never been incarnated into human form. They tend not to be involved  \n&gt; in any way with lower forms of vibration.\n&gt;\n&gt; Edgar Cayce spoke of them. Their souls were created as the moment  \n&gt; of Creation. They chose not to have ever incarnated. Since their  \n&gt; vibration level is far more than a lowly entity, I highly doubt  \n&gt; that they would interact with lower entities. They are on a  \n&gt; completely different level of existence.\n&gt;\n&gt; Al\n&gt;\n&gt; -- black bear hollow &lt;blackbearhollow@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I just said that in reference to Al&#39;s comments.

I have to base my  \n&gt;&gt; conclusions on the EVP files, not speculation, even from the  \n&gt;&gt; victims. Do you know of instances where they audibly claimed to be  \n&gt;&gt; nonhuman?
