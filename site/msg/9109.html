<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Clarification:  Minimal &#x27;listing&#x27; fee for the eBay seller - not a minimal selling price.  The 
download would be offered as FREE.

&gt; Hi Jeff.  Sorry for my blasting you.  I still feel that taking a loss on a product is not 
sending  
&gt; any meaningful message to the guy, and would only possibly prevent one sale, for every 
&gt; unit sold at a loss ... but providing a listing at a minimal fee (with no hassles of money 
up 
&gt; front, going to the post office, etc.) would work great.  
&gt; 
&gt; Again, sorry for being Devil&#x27;s Advocate.  :-(  As I posted to Bruce and Jeremy... 
essentially, 
&gt; I am on the same moral page with the rest of you!

&gt; &gt; Hi Kay,
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; That was what I posted on my original idea over a week ago and I was  blasted 
&gt; &gt; about it especially that I would look like a fool that I was willing to  take 
&gt; &gt; a loss of a few bucks.  But atleast the hacking information and links  would 
&gt; &gt; have been posted on ebay for all to see.

&gt; &gt; I checked to see what it would cost to sell one of ebay. To list it 
&gt; &gt; it  is $1.00 for $25.00-449.00 plus 8.75% of the initial $25.00 
&gt; &gt; ($2.19), plus  3.50% of the remaining closing value balance ($25.01 
&gt; &gt; to  $1,000.00)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would be willing to list the one I have plus give the  information 
&gt; &gt; on the free hacking and that fact that you can get one at  Radio 
&gt; &gt; Shack for $24.99 just to shut this guy down. At the most I would be  
&gt; &gt; out $1.00 to not sell it!!!! Well worth it I&#x27;d say.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Can someone  send me the written instructions on how to hack the  12-
&gt; &gt; 249.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Either that, or  anyone willing to make them for $25 + shipping 
&gt; &gt; with 
&gt; &gt; &gt; no profit?  You could then list them just like the ones that are 
&gt; &gt; &gt; selling...so  they pull up identical to the listings that are up 
&gt; &gt; &gt; there. :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking if someone would list a FREE DOWNLOAD of  
&gt; &gt; &gt; instructions for the various hacks 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the Radio Shack  units, it could put an end to the business 
&gt; &gt; for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; sellers that are  taking 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of people who are unaware that they could  probably 
&gt; &gt; hack 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the units for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves. 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen &quot;downloads&quot; of various things listed before.  Why 
&gt; &gt; not 
&gt; &gt; &gt; this?
