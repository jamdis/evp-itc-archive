<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks April, but I am aware of the shortcomings of the box, and all these methods. I don&#x27;t really need some &quot;expert&quot; telling me what it really is. I&#x27;ve said very often that none of this s--- it written stone, and it ain&#x27;t gospel either, same with these opinions. 

 Personally I don&#x27;t give a crap about proof, it&#x27;s the fact that something talks that intrigues me, and how to make it better. These skepdicks make alot of assumptions about my motives, and character. 99% of the time they are way wrong. I don&#x27;t do this work for mankind, or the paranormal community, fame or fortune. That&#x27;s why the skeptic attacks are so insulting and infuriating.

&gt; Mind you, it hasn&#x27;t been too many, because I don&#x27;t get many EVP&#x27;s that I
&gt; deem worthy enough to put up as evidence.
&gt; 
&gt; My sole purpose with this whole volley this last few days was to try and
&gt; convince Frank that I am not picking on him or his research by being
&gt; skeptical. If I where just here to tear him apart, I would be commenting on
&gt; everything he posts.

&gt; &gt; Who are you referring to? I have shared a few EVP&#x27;s with this group asking
&gt; &gt; what they hear. I do this every time I get an EVP. I post them to all my
&gt; &gt; groups, not just this one.

&gt; &gt;&gt; You know its kind of humorous for me that those who have the desire to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;discuss&quot; thier different views are often the ones who do the least amount
&gt; &gt;&gt; of actual research... as long as you have been in this group not once have
&gt; &gt;&gt; you shared one evp. If you did then please refresh my memory. This seems to
&gt; &gt;&gt; more about commenting on what others share for you than it is about doing
&gt; &gt;&gt; any research yourself. Im not sure what you are looking for, if you are here
&gt; &gt;&gt; to learn, correspond, or if you are just here to get a rise out of others
&gt; &gt;&gt; but to be honest I do not have time for it.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Frank bans anyone or not is up to him entirely. But I have warned
&gt; &gt;&gt; you before and I am saying it again. Cut the crap and move on. That goes for
&gt; &gt;&gt; ALL of you. I dont mind discussions, I dont mind differences of opinion but
&gt; &gt;&gt; I do mind BS.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; If you have research to share then do so, if your research yeilds no
&gt; &gt;&gt; results then state it as such. If your only purpose for being in this group
&gt; &gt;&gt; is to question others, disect them, and cause negative discussions then
&gt; &gt;&gt; perhaps you are wasting your time here. You are definitely wasting mine.
