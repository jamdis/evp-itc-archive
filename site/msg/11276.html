 I see 'death' clouds like this before j=
ust aobut every natural disaster, most of the time they are much clear, and=
 look like shulls. Oftne they appear only as th eeye sockets from the skull=

ter this I heard about another fatality int a tornado. Thre sky has be=
en full of these clouds this year. 
 
 There is also frequently s=
ymbols, some almost look like Mayan, but I don't understand them. I think t=
