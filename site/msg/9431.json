It&#39;s kinda funny, at the time I picked up my crystals, I&#39;d never heard of Lemurians, but \nwhen I read about them last year and looked at what I had, sure enough there were some \nthat are matches to those shown on the internet, with horizontal lines running up the \nsurface.  Made me feel lucky to have selected them (or maybe they selected me?)  ;-)\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Margaret and Rees\n&gt; \n&gt; I have bought crystals from metaphysical stores, rock shops, ebay etc. \n&gt; I got some via the slow boat from china too! The prices vary so much \n&gt; depending on where you buy them and what kind of crystal they are. \n&gt; \n&gt; Like you said Margaret just look and see which one your drawn too. \n&gt; \n&gt; Kay\n&gt;"}
