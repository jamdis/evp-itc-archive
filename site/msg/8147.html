Hi Debbie,
 
Yes I am most certainly getting and hearing messages, respons=
es and answers in real time.
I do verbalize my sessions, I ask questions an=
d answer questions they may ask.
 
When you ask a question give at least te=
n seconds before you ask the next question.
Our friends may not be able to =
catch the correct signal or radio fragment to answer
immediatelly. Listen c=
arefully during the time after a question and if it is answered and the 
co=
nditions are optimal, such as a good signal and strong response. you should=
 hear the answer if not all 
part of it in real time.
 
most of the time we=
 miss the real time communication due to the speed of the sweep of the ammo=
unt of clutter the signal
is producing. I work with only the AM band, I fin=
d it less crowded than FM and therefore easier to catch real time responses=
.
 
The yes, no and name responses are the easiest to hear real time. The m=
ain thing is to listen carefully for any words or 
phrases that pertain to =
the question you have asked. Also when you do hear a real time communicatio=
n, immediatelly
repeat what was said. That gives varification when listenin=
g back to the recording that you did in fact hear it real time.
 
At first =
get yourself accustomed to listening for the simple yes, no answers and you=
r ear will start to develop for seperating the 
spirit communication from t=
he radio noise.
 
I hope this helps.
 
Bruce
