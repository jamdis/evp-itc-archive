I wish I had one of those boxes, so how can they be "crap" when  everyone 
wants one? sf

Why I've had enough of these insane idiots in the so  called paranormal. 
God forbid anyone should question their little  pearls of wisdom flowing from 
their sacred keyboards.
 
 I''ve said it before, and I'll say it again, I do this  work for my own 
curiosity, I don't seek fame and fortune like these  others do, and I have no 
ego to puff up to the world. I do not care  if anyone uses my boxes, I don't 
even sell the crap. It ain't gonna  matter---the comet is on it's way! 
Y'all have three years, I'd use  the time wisely.
 
 I left the name off this, but anyone can probably figure  out who sent it, 
the same person that attacks many researchers in  this field. 
 
"Frank,

You have a big mouth on that piece of shit  group evp-itc come over to 
the---- group where I can respond to your  fuckin retarded rants. You call me a 
crack head, you senile old  idiot, don't hate people for being your superior 
in the field just  because your boxes are crap now and nobody uses them for 
anything  other than dust collecters. If I were you I would go back into 
the  bathroom sit on the bowl and think about what an obscure hasbeen  asshole 
you have become. 

Come to my group and open  your mouth and I'll take the wind right out of 
your fuckin  sails.

All is possible, nothing is  probable"
