I \nrealize the chamber is not necessary, but I think with the 12-469, it \nhelps to run it into a box to mix it, which helps remove the &quot;click&quot; \nnoise received while it sweeps the AM band.  Also, I want to try \nbouncing down an echo chamber, so it slows the sound down a bit to \npossibly make it easier to hear. Still experimenting here.\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi LC,\n&gt; \n&gt; The mic is a &quot;ListenUp&quot; brand.  I got it at Radio Shack.  They had \n&gt; their own brand there too, but theirs was about $12 more.  I think \n&gt; they just started carrying the &quot;ListenUp&quot; brand.  I like the blue \n&gt; light effect too...\n&gt; The earbuds came with the mic, but they are not amplifeid, just the \n&gt; mic is.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mike, one more question for you:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What&#39;s the brand of amplified mic you are using and does Radio \n&gt; SHack \n&gt; &gt; have it, too?  It seems to be a bit better than the amplified \nlapel \n&gt; &gt; mic I am using inside my echo chamber.  I am experimenting with \ntwo \n&gt; &gt; mics, as when I added the splitter I couldn&#39;t get any audio out \nof \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; like you do.  It must either be the mic you are using is better, \nor \n&gt; &gt; the headphones/earbuds you use are amplified (??).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have produced another video, this one of my completed \nportable \n&gt; &gt; Ghost \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Box System (Mike&#39;s Box 12.470)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This video, in three parts on YouTube walks you through how the \n&gt; &gt; chamber \n&gt; &gt; &gt; system works, while describing the components and going through \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; description of how to control the devices with the chamber \nclosed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Video - Portable Ghost Box System Part 1 of 3\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUOkWGrz94s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Video - Portable Ghost Box System Part 2 of 3\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xirOLjEf1bQ\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Video - Portable Ghost Box System Part 3 of 3\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs7ep7-G7Aw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
