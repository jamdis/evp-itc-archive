If ghosts are coming through the box \n&gt; and thus are  not in a good state of mind, how come on Paranormal \n&gt; State CM was willing  to believe the message given by the ghost via \n&gt; the box as being truth  (The ghost via the box said a &quot;demon&quot; was \n&gt; holding the ghosts captive  there)? \n&gt; \n&gt; I would suggest that perhaps a ghost (assuming we are  talking \nabout a \n&gt; disembodied person who remains earthbound) is not in a  healthy \nstate \n&gt; of mind one would consider &quot;stable,&quot; but trapped in  emotional \ntrauma \n&gt; of some sort. Thus, how reliable could the message of a  ghost then \n&gt; be? ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com_ (mailto:EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups.com) ,  \n&gt; &quot;wgungfu&quot; &lt;wgungfu3@ .&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t know if anyone  caught it, but Frank&#39;s box was used on last\n&gt; &gt; night&#39;s episode of  Paranormal State on A&E. They were \ninvestigating\n&gt; &gt; an old insane  asylum, and they had Chris Moon as a guest \n&gt; investigator\n&gt; &gt; with the  box. You can see the promo clip here:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; _http://www.pennstat eprs.com/ ps_asylum. mov_ \n&gt; (http://www.pennstateprs.com/ps_asylum.mov) \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s the site for the show itself:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; _http://www.aetv. com/paranormal- state/index. jsp_ \n&gt; (http://www.aetv.com/paranormal-state/index.jsp) \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; For those not familiar, its a half hour show that follows along  \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Penn State Paranormal Research Society&quot; and different cases  \nthey \n&gt; take\n&gt; &gt; on. Their niche in the &quot;paranormal reality tv show&quot;  market is \nthat\n&gt; &gt; the group&#39;s leader follows a more Christian  orientated skew on\n&gt; &gt; happenings. Lots of &quot;demons&quot; (they have Lorraine  Warren guest \nall \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; time), and they usually try to do  investigations/ communication \nonly\n&gt; &gt; during what they call &quot;dead  time&quot;, 3am-4am, or &quot;the polar \nopposite \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; 3pm - the time Jesus  gave is life for all mankind&quot; as they put \nit. \n&gt; Oh,\n&gt; &gt; and they have  an &quot;occult specialist&quot; on the team that so far has \n&gt; been\n&gt; &gt; anything  but.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On the positive side, they did actually get (and  record for later\n&gt; &gt; analysis) live communication on the box in response  to questions \n&gt; being\n&gt; &gt; asked. And on the analysis and isolation of  the recorded parts, \nyou\n&gt; &gt; could actually hear what was being said (as  opposed to the usual \nof\n&gt; &gt; Chris acting as a go-between for very  distorted sounds like on \nthose\n&gt; &gt; youtube videos). So it was good to  see it a)working in \nthe &quot;field&quot;\n&gt; &gt; and b)get some exposure on a tv  show.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Marty\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; ____________________________________\n&gt; Looking for last minute shopping deals? _Find  them fast with \nYahoo!
