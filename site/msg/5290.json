I picked up an old style 12-469 that seems to work \nsimilar to the old style 470, but every one i get seems to have a \nvarying AM signal.  Some RS boxes are louder than others on AM, maybe \nit&#39;s how many times the wire is wrapped around the AM coil.  I sit \nthem side by side and get different signals....pretty weird.  I was \nin a location last week with all the boxes and the only one that got \na signal with was frank&#39;s box, i can&#39;t explain that either.  How can \ni get different AM signals with different boxes...it&#39;s still AM right?\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Steve,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Good file as usual, a little noisy.
