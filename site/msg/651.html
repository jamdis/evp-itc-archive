<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi All;

Information for people who attemp to build my circuits, but can&#x27;t get it to 
work. The white noise transistor is pretty critical. If it&#x27;s out put is too 
low you won&#x27;t be able to get a signal through the first low pass filter, the 
one with the 82K resistors. I&#x27;ve been trying to work the bugs out of the 
systems, and that&#x27;s one thing that has driven me nuts the last few weeks. I 
had one board that was working and another, exactly the same that would not 
work. It turned out to be the transistor, as soon as I put in a Radio Shack 
2N3904, the thing started to work. So, it seems you need cheap generic 
transistors that are noisy for the RVG to work properly. I bought a pack of 
&quot;NPN swithcing transistors&quot; The 3904&#x27;s seem to work the best, but the 2222&#x27;s 
will work if you select one that has a high white noise output. The 
transistors that I normally use were form mouser.com, and the output was 
only about .005v peak peak to peak. With the 2N3904&#x27;s, the output is about 
.05 volts. You almost have to have a scope to build these circuits. The 
scope I use is just a cheappy, I paid $10 for it at a garage sale.
