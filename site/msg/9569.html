<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Does that bother you? Doing this work we all know it shouldn&#x27;t. I 
have to ask before I say &quot;join the club&quot; LOL

Many involved in this research have experienced it at one time or 
another. For those who think they can turn on or turn off the spirit 
world or open/close some invisible doorway, it can be very unsettling 
to be communicated with when they arent expecting it and sometimes in 
ways they dont appreciate. 

If I am tryin to sleep thats not the time to try talking to me, 
alive, dead, etc.. makes no difference. But now and then its loud and 
clear enough to make me &quot;look&quot; for the speaker. Whispers in the 
ear &quot;i love you&quot; &quot;can you hear me&quot;, or even &quot;HEY WAKE UP&quot; yelled in 
the ear... I am sure its funny to watch me run around and hunt for 
the invisible man/woman, I know when I talked with a few people (who 
are now passed) we always said that would be fun to do if we could 
come back to &quot;haunt&quot; people we would definitely give it our best 
shot. When I am wide awake and very much aware, it can be a different 
experience. Especially if they answer you back. 

I did once get a man who sang an old fashioned song I had never heard 
and played on his fiddle the most amazing melody. I was sick in bed 
listening to the rushing water from the fish tank when it suddenly 
changed and his singing got louder and louder...so the whole time I 
was hearing it I was saying to myself wow this is some fever. Hmmmm 
how high is this fever maybe I should get up and check again. Dang! 
That guy can really sing! I just checked my temperature 5 minutes ago 
(just under 101) it cant have changed that much surely.. This dude 
frickin rawks! Wow now he has a violin no wait thats a fiddle. Ok 
this is definitely a cool hallucination or I am dying. Either way 
bring it on I aint budging! So I finally just relaxed and stopped 
worrying if I was tripping and enjoyed the rest of his song. I 
decided later if I had been hallucinating perhaps I should try 
getting fevers more often. It was a little painful but the discomfort 
is just a distant memory...the song...well the song left quite a mark!

It&#x27;s something I questioned myself about at first and them about over 
the years using various methods.
*h20 method = &quot;your not causing those you&#x27;re hearing from the 
fountain&quot; 
*evpmaker method = &quot;they&#x27;re coming by the fountain&quot;

They call the fish tank the fountain tho it has other connotations. 
*sweep tuning = &quot;its good to drink the fountains of the knowledge&quot;

I am kind of thirsty now that I mention it gonna go get a drink after 
I post a couple =)

&gt; She means not recording at all. Like she is in the kitchen or in 
the garage, and her radio is stored away and not on.  Before I 
started box research, I have started to hear the spirits talking to 
me now, mostly when I go to bed. Rhonda is hearing them too.

&gt; Do you mean leaving the box on and unattended?

&gt;         Have you had it happen while you were away from the boxes, 
like going about normal errands around the house or about to fall 
asleep?

&gt;  
&gt; I have my name mentioned at least 10 times during a normal session, 
before the big tech mix up mike and lisa would 
&gt; adress me by my name constantly, usually one of the first things a 
new researcher hears is their name being called
&gt; I believe our friends do this to give immediate validation to the 
new box user that they are indeed recieving spirit
&gt; communication.

&gt;         Hey Mike,
&gt;    
&gt;   Ive actually heard or thought I heard my name being called a few 
times...the first time I kinda brushed it off as me being overly 
tired but Ive had it happen a few times since when I wasnt overly 
tired.  I havent heard anything else just my name.  Id be curious to 
know if others had this happen to them too.

&gt;         That is funnny.. Yeah, I am amazed they can see us, and to 
think even before I got involved in Box EVP, I never thought once 
that they are right here in the room with us.
&gt;    
&gt;   Have a question for you. Margaret had mentioned in one of her 
posts that once we start Box Research, if we never have before, we 
are more likely to become chairaudient.
&gt;    
&gt;   Last night, was amazing for me while lying in bed. I heard them 
talking to me for the first time. It was really neat.
&gt;    
&gt;   Has this happened to you yet, or even to Kristin since the three 
of us are relatively new at this?
