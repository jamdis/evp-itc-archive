So, I let the session run on its own and sent him the raw\n&gt; &gt; file.Well, sure enough, it is working just fine. I had some static\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; learned to move the radio around to a better spot.But amazingly one\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; the messages was &quot; I want to see Bruce !&quot;You can hear it clear as\n&gt; day.\n&gt; &gt; Also, I got some vulgar messages and I wonder about this. When\n&gt; Debbie\n&gt; &gt; did a session with me in the beginning she got some eye opening\n&gt; &gt; messages for me. One was &quot;cut the bull ----&quot;. Debbie said that can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; be !!! but it was right on !!! we were trying to contact my mom and\n&gt; &gt; that was one of her favorite sayings here !!! LOLHowever, the\n&gt; messages\n&gt; &gt; Bruce recovered in my session were a little more vulgar and not\n&gt; &gt; something from my mom.I also had events in the house after starting\n&gt; &gt; recording sessions.The RS box would go on by itself, not while I was\n&gt; &gt; home, and I live alone. This happened several times, the third time\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; came home my computerized clothes dryer locked it&#39;s control panel,\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; RS was on and my wireless router needed to be reset. I now need help\n&gt; &gt; with Audacity or sound booth. I don&#39;t know how to use it to clean\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; background noise up.Thanks again Bruce (I hope you don&#39;t mind my\n&gt; &gt; posting !!??)Holly\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pack up or back up–use SkyDrive to transfer files or keep extra\n&gt; &gt; copies.
