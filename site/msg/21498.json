Here is some info. on what i&#39;m  talking ab=\r\nout, \nJC would never have a sick horse either.  Having horse&#39;s  myself I kn=\r\now all \nabout this stuff, none of my horse&#39;s are cribbers.

Note that  \ncribbing and wood chewing are not the=\r\n same. Some horses will chew on wood  \nwithout arching their neck or suckin=\r\ng in air.  \nThe last thing that a stable owner needs is a cribber. A cribbi=\r\nng horse can \n drive even the strongest horseman to his knees in frustratio=\r\nn. Not only is \nit  obnoxious to witness, cribbing can also impair a horse=\r\n=E2=80=99s long-term \nhealth and  cause significant damage to a stable.  \nT=\r\nhe bad news is there=E2=80=99s no =E2=80=9Cmagic bullet=E2=80=9D to overcom=\r\ne a cribbing problem  \nsince what may work for one may not work for another=\r\n. But there=E2=80=99s an \nassortment  of remedies that just might solve you=\r\nr horse=E2=80=99s vice. But first things \nfirst,  what causes a perfectly h=\r\nealthy and supposedly normal horse to crib?  \nSo far it is believed that th=\r\ne two major causes of horse cribbing are:  \n* Boredom\n* The example set by =\r\nother cribbers in the stable \nBy nature, horses are grazing animals. So whe=\r\nn they=E2=80=99re forced to remain  \nwithin a stall for long periods of tim=\r\ne without hay to graze on, they=E2=80=99ll  \neventually become stressed. Th=\r\nis stress leaves them open to picking up a vice to \n distract their idle mi=\r\nnd.  \nSo the easiest measure you can take to prevent your horse from turnin=\r\ng into \na  cribber is to ensure your horse doesn=E2=80=99t stand idle all d=\r\nay and become \nbored. One  step you can take is to consider much more frequ=\r\nent yet slightly \nsmaller  portions of hay instead of feeding three huge fl=\r\nakes of hay a day.  \nAnother measure is to look into finding horse toys tha=\r\nt can entertain your  \nhorse while he=E2=80=99s not eating or you could con=\r\nsider salt licks for his =E2=80=9Cdown \n time=E2=80=9D. Of course, the most=\r\n ideal solution is to set him out to pasture.  \nUnfortunately, this isn=E2=\r\n=80=99t an option available to most stable owners. \nThe second major cause =\r\nof cribbing is the example set by other cribbers.  \nHorses are herd animals=\r\n and so they tend to observe =E2=80=95 and more importantly  \nimitate =E2=\r\n=80=95 each other=E2=80=99s actions. If a horse watches another horse crib =\r\nfor  \nextended periods of time (especially an idle observer) then there=E2=\r\n=80=99s a good  \nchance the observer will also copy the behavior he sees. S=\r\nome horses will  \ndismiss the cribber and never pick up the vice. But it ca=\r\nn be an extremely  \ncontagious habit. If it=E2=80=99s possible at all, a st=\r\nable owner should isolate a  \ncribber from the rest of the herd.  \nCribbing=\r\n can be an incredibly difficult habit to break a horse from once it \n is al=\r\nlowed to take root. The reason for this is two-fold:  \n* Cribbing is believ=\r\ned to be an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)\n*  Cribbing is a natural hi=\r\ngh \nCribbing is more than just an obnoxious habit that can damage your \npro=\r\nperty.  It is a vice that can create long-term health problems for your hor=\r\nse. \nThe most  obvious health issue for cribbers is their teeth since the c=\r\nonstant \ngrinding of  teeth against wood, plastic or metal wears them down =\r\nat an \nabnormally quick  pace. A long-term cribber can grind his front teet=\r\nh down so \nlow that a gap  exists between the upper and lower teeth even wh=\r\nen the jaw is \ncompletely closed.  \nIt is also commonly believed that cribb=\r\ning can ultimately lead to an  \nincreased chance of _colic_ (http://www.hor=\r\nsecribbing.com/horse-colic/) , \nflatulence, and digestion problems due to t=\r\nhe  air that=E2=80=99s swallowed. For this \nreason, there are some equine i=\r\nnsurance companies  that will refuse to provide \ninsurance to a horse that =\r\nexhibits this vice. They  simply don=E2=80=99t believe the \nincreased risk =\r\nof health issues is worth it.  \nSome recent studies have questioned this co=\r\nmmon belief, suggesting that \nonly  a small amount of air is taken in durin=\r\ng cribbing that actually reaches \nthe  stomach. The researchers suggest tha=\r\nt the increased colic and flatulence \naren=E2=80=99t  directly attributed t=\r\no the cribbing itself, but rather to secondary \nfactors such  as worn teeth=\r\n.  \nWhen a horse=E2=80=99s teeth are worn down to the point they can=E2=80=\r\n=99t properly grind \nthe  food, their digestion will suffer significantly. =\r\nAs a result, this \nleads to an  increased chance of colic. So no matter how=\r\n you look at it, \ncribbing can impair  a horse=E2=80=99s health significant=\r\nly, particularly over the span of \na lifetime.  \nIf you own a cribbing hors=\r\ne, then don=E2=80=99t despair! There are a variety of  \nproducts or techniq=\r\nues that you can use to help you overcome horse cribbing in \n your stable. =\r\n&quot;\n\r\n--part1_15404.1e6456f1.3b01533f_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Language: en\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUTF-8&quot;&gt;\n&lt;M=\r\nETA content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.17097&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY id=3D=\r\nrole_body style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot;   b=\r\nottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Drol=\r\ne_document   face=3DArial color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;One other funny th=\r\ning is this dude has a collar around the horse&#39;s upper \nneck or throat, &nb=\r\nsp;it&#39;s there to stop the horse from what&#39;s calling cribbing, \nlol&nbsp; &n=\r\nbsp;called a throat strap.&nbsp; Here is some info. on what i&#39;m \ntalking ab=\r\nout, JC would never have a sick horse either.&nbsp; Having horse&#39;s \nmyself =\r\nI know all about this stuff, none of my horse&#39;s are cribbers.&nbsp; Got \nho=\r\nld of this article for you guys to read up, then take a look at the \nguys&n=\r\nbsp;poor horse, who even looks discussed with him too.&nbsp; \n&nbsp;sf&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3D&quot;post_box top&quot; id=3Dpost-2&gt;\n&lt;DIV cla=\r\nss=3Dheadline_area&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;&quot;What Is Horse Cribbing&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dfor=\r\nmat_text&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&quot;What is Horse Cribbing? &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;=E2=80=9CCribbing=E2=80=9D, a=\r\nlso known as =E2=80=9C&lt;A   href=3D&quot;http://www.horsecribbing.com/wind-suckin=\r\ng/&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#2361a1&gt;wind \nsucking&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;=E2=80=9D, is the act of =\r\na horse gripping an edge such as a wooden \nfence, grain bin, metal round pe=\r\nn, stable door, etc., with his front teeth, \narching his neck and swallowin=\r\ng air. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;This act of swallowing air creates a grunting or belching no=\r\nise.
