The Box has hit the fan!
Current mood: distressed

&quot;I have recently
been made aware that there are several replica versions of this
device being sold. I have also been told of another device that can
be purchased for very little from any electronics merchant and
altered by hand, producing what some consider to be results. As I
expected, the samples that people have sent me are *nothing more
than timed radio scans that have no validity.* [emphasis mine]

&quot;These new &quot;radio scanners&quot; are not only *a waste of money* for
people looking to do research with them in hopes of having
effective communication with the other side, but may in fact be *very
dangerous*. Should demonic and other negative entities learn to use
these false
 devices, *the results could be devastating.*

 &quot;...The Catholic Church ... predicted the widespread sale of
*false communication devices* as far back as last year. *I have recently
begun to receive requests from individuals asking for help to close
negative doorways and portals that they believe they opened using
their purchased Telephone to the Dead replica*. Others are claiming
&gt; that I am a fraud because their purchased device doesn&#x27;t produce
the positive results I have been fortunate enough to have.&quot;

So let&#x27;s go throug this again:

*nothing more than timed radio scans that have no validity.*

*a waste of money*

*very dangerous*

*the results could be devastating.*

*false communication devices*

*I have recently begun to receive requests from individuals asking for
help to close negative doorways and portals that they believe they
opened using their purchased Telephone to the Dead replica.*

As you see, there are two statements that Chris is making--so much for
he&#x27;s always consistant, which I believe was an earlier statement that
you made.

1. The new boxes create accidental timed radio scans only.

2. The new boxes are very dangerous because they draw negative results.

I&#x27;m not sure how the two statements can stand together, but in either
case, his opinion is clearly not complimentary toward the rest of the
box users besides the four of the 30 he says, in the same post, &quot;have
been identified.&quot;

Rather cheeky and insulting and wrong, HMO. But if he just goes on
doing sessions like the one APSR recorded, I will continue to laud them.
