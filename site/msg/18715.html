<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It would be tough to add the amp to a hack radio, I added it to the tuner
after it was unmanufactured. You have to pull the tuner, add some turns of
wire around the antena rod, bring some leads out of the case and make a
little add on box outside the radio. Might be easier, but more expensive to
get an external antenna, like C-Crane&#x27;s twin coil ferrite antenna, or RS&#x27;s
amplfied AM antenna. You should be able to get AM skipo at night.

&gt; Wish i had me one of those, this RS 12-150 works well on the FM but, very
&gt; little comes in on AM, not enough stations around here I guess, I put an
&gt; ante on it too.  The Peanut gallery are still crossing into the light to be
&gt; with (You know who) one at a time, and they are saying the line going is
&gt; still huge. sf

&gt;  Trying to get improvement for weak signal areas. I added a simple single
&gt; stage FET antenna amplifier to the AM rod antenna by adding and extra loop
&gt; on the end of the rod. It&#x27;s specially designed to reject all MP3 signals at
&gt; the antenna :-0

I would be ough o add he amp o a hack adio, I added i o he une a e i was unmanu ac u ed.

Migh be easie , bu mo e expensi e o ge an ex e nal an enna, like C-C ane&#x27;s win coil e i e an enna, o RS&#x27;s ampl ied AM an enna. You should be able o ge AM skipo a nigh .
