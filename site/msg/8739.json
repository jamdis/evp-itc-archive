I work with\n&gt; lasers and light mostly as a transmission source. I think you are on\n&gt; to something with using parts of speech for a sound source. I got\n&gt; distracted for a little while playing with these hacks and boxes as\n&gt; they like to call them. They are effective but limited in my use of\n&gt; them.\n\nYes, there&#39;s yet a lot to research and to improve. What are you doing\nwith lasers/light?\n\nStefan"}
