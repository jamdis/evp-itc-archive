The researcher is always part of the equation. The spirit is not talking to=
 the recorder! I record EVP and DRV everyday, with great results. I have be=
en recording with a ITC group since March which seems to have "boosted" the=
 clarity of the messages we get. Resonance is the key!

If you look at peop=
le who get consistent results everytime you will find that they are connect=
ed to something greater than themselves. They are usually even tempered wit=
h very little extreme emotions. Their interests do not lie in the mechanism=
 of communication so much or gathering evidence to prove or disprove a theo=
ry. They are interested in the message and the connection we have with the =
spirits we all have around us. Its how our own spirit (who we really are) c=
onnects with the ones we are speaking with. 
Everyone has heard the term, "=
like attracts like". This is a crude basis for resonance! Your spiritual pr=
ogress or rate of vibration determines what kind of etherial crowd you will=
 attract and hang out with. A lot of the viewpoints of investigators comes =
from the belief that we are primarily physical beings. This is an automatic=
 belief because of the conditioning and programming we have received by our=
 societies all our lives. What the spirits have been telling us for thousan=
ds of years in scriptures, spiritual teachings, inspired philosophy and so =
on is that we are primarily spiritual beings. We are the "ghost in the mach=
ine", not the machine.

Now, I know many of you who actually take the time =
to read all this will try to write these words off as some kind of personal=
 belief of mine or a unsupported philosophy. In fact everything I have just=
 stated is supported by 30 years of messages received from the 70's to the =
present through ITC contacts all over the world.

So to validate your belie=
f Bill, yes it very much depends on the person who is recording the EVP! ;)=

Frank R.

            One of the reasons I believe the researche=
r is often part of the

process is because some investigators seem to be ab=
le to consistently

obtain evp's while others are not, despite many attempt=
s over years of

investigating. Sometimes the teams in CA refer to those wh=
o often get

decent results as "evp magnets". 



I think the individuals w=
ho can easily obtain good results (no matter

where they are) may be able t=
o channel their psychic abilities into PK

energy and record the results as=
 an evp. I'm not suggesting this is

what happens every time but it may be =
what's happening in some of the

cases.
