<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think it&#x27;s actually an interesting idea. If we can synthesize the 
allophone tones to read the text, we might get some results. It may 
be possible.

&gt; I did not realize that it had to recognize a voice. I just thought 
that it would print what was recorded. Oh well...

&gt; a very smart idea. I just wanted to run it, to see if it would even 
&gt; work. An issue that I noticed while doing this is that there is a 
lag 
&gt; time. When the program does recognize the allophones, it will show 
&gt; what it thinks was said and will wait for a &quot;sentence&quot; to finish. 
The 
&gt; problem with that is when doing that, Naturally speaking would 
erase 
&gt; some of what it thought was said if the allophones kept going. When 
I 
&gt; was listening, I think I recognized some things that the program 
&gt; didn&#x27;t type down. I&#x27;ll try to run a few more experiments later 
&gt; tonight when I get home from work.
&gt; 
&gt; LK: The session was probably maybe 10 minutes or so. The program 
&gt; didn&#x27;t type down everything, so I will try to tweak it some more, 
&gt; maybe by slowing down EVPMaker. I believe it became clear longer, 
&gt; because I slowed it down to 80% or so during the session. I will 
&gt; definately trying to adjust it some more and share the results 
again.
&gt; 
&gt; Stefan/Ron L.: That definately does sound like a good idea. I will 
&gt; see if I can try that. Maybe when I get home, I will see if I can 
&gt; copy and paste the text that is supposed to be read to the group. 
If 
&gt; I can, anybody that can help in synthesizing the allophones to read 
&gt; the text, that would be a great help. To do that you have to have 
&gt; Adobe Audition correct? Or is there anything else you can use/build?
