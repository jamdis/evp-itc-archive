Experiment 2

On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on top of =
my computer monitor, right in front of me, and will leave it there until no=
on Denver time on Monday, 7/19/2010. This experiment asks for participants =
to determine what that object is. Vague or partial answers won't be counted=
 (for example, just giving a color, shape, size, what it's made of, etc): w=
e're looking for what it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Monday won't=
 count. Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other=
 means they chose. At the end of the experiment, I will reveal the object, =
and a tally of the number of correct and/or incorrect answers.

In order to=
 keep me honest, I have taken a picture of the object at the start of the e=
xperiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group. The=
 idea with this file is that you can download it now and 'keep it safe' on =
your computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I will post the password =
so you can reveal the contents of the file. That way, you were in control o=
f the original image during the entire test, not me. If you can follow the =
link, it is here:

Windows users: http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP=
-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ20100716. win.zip

Mac users: http://tech. groups.yahoo. c=
om/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ20100716. mac.zip

And if you do not care to =
download the zip file now, I will post the final image there at the end of =
the experiment anyway.

My monitor is one of the older box-like SONY CRTs, =
and says "Trinitron" and "Multiscan 200sf" on the upper front. I have a cou=
ple monitors stacked in my closet too: they are not the monitors used in th=
is experiment (and have nothing else on them anyway), and I have several la=
ptops around: they are also not the monitors in this experiment. The monito=
r in this experiment is the only SONY monitor I have, says "SONY in various=
 places on it, can be seen in the following link from the first experiment,=
 when the correct answer would have been "radio":

http://tech. groups.yaho=
o. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710. 1.JPG

Please post all answers=
 to the group thread: that way, there will be a public record and I won't g=
et accused of losing any answers. 

And best of luck to all the participant=
s!
