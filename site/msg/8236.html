Hi all, I just wanted to introduce myself. As you can see from my addy, my=
 name is Pat and from CT (and sometimes Maine) ...My youngest son committed=
 suicide 10 yrs ago. He was one of many young men in my family to pass on y=
oung (he was 24, I was 43) and our birthdays were only a week apart. His bi=
rthday would have been Easter Sunday.I was introduced to Frank's Box via Pa=
ranormal State and it spiked my interest. I do have an avid interest with t=
he paranormal, howevere, I do believe that if I ever had anything happen to=
 me personally, I would probably panic.I am interested in the price of some=
one making a box for me, and, of course, instructions on how to do this and=
 stay safe. Like many others, my interest is contact with family members wh=
o have passed on, most especially, my son Brian. He was a believer in these=
 things too. Unfortunately, he was diagnosed with a mental illness, and ins=
tead of giving meds a try, he felt his life would never be "normal" again, =
and chose to go back home to God and his beloved "Gramps". I cry just think=
ing of all this, as my father was most Beloved to me too.If any of you are =
able to ask the question if Brian or Tom (grandson and grandfather) are pre=
sent, and if they can get any messages to me, I would appreciate it. The te=
ars are streaming down my eyes just thinking of all this, as I lost Brian a=
nd my Dad within about 18 mos of each other.Have to run, I hear my sis comi=
ng home. Thanks for any help any of you could offer.Pat
