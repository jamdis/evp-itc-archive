You can go smaller, but not larger.\n\nWhen you enlarge a digital ph=\r\noto, the photo gets stretched, but the same amount of pixels have to now fi=\r\nll in, so they get larger, which magnifies the pixelation. You end up with =\r\na blocky &quot;lo-res&quot; image. You can choose to have it &quot;resample&quot;, but then you=\r\n get what RJ described, where the program looks at the existing pixels and =\r\nadd pixels that are an average of the surrounding pixels. So you still end =\r\nup what a grainy, digital looking picture.\n\nWhen saving a photo to a compre=\r\nssed format, such as jpeg, you actually loose data, or pixels. The program =\r\ndecides which data to drop to make the file smaller. Each time you open and=\r\n resave, you loose more data.The resolution gets worse and worse.\n\nThis is =\r\nthe same thing that happens with audio files, you loose data each time you =\r\nsave it to a compressed format.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Rj=\r\n \n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, May 10, 2009 10:54 AM\n  Su=\r\nbject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Pixelization doesn&#39;=\r\nt clean-up the data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a picture of a field o=\r\nf flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixelization to the picture.  Soo=\r\nn, you would not be able to tell there were flowers there at all.  You woul=\r\nd see a lot of colored blocks.\n\n        Or in the other direction, imagine =\r\nyou are looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on your screen: a c=\r\nomplete screen of truely random static snow.  Pixelizing this, after a whil=\r\ne, you would again start to see colored blocks.\n\n        What&#39;s happening i=\r\ns that it is processing an area of the image, taking (for instance) the ave=\r\nrage value of that entire area, and replacing all the blocks in that area w=\r\nith the average.  In video processing, this would result in a field of mult=\r\ni-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish blo=\r\nck, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise example, it maybe replace=\r\n all the random pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.  If you did n=\r\not know beforehand what the original picture was, you couldn&#39;t tell whether=\r\n your pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, the sky with =\r\nclouds, or a random bunch of pixels.\n\n        It works the same with the so=\r\nund files.  Taking something as complex as speech, and replacing frequencie=\r\ns with their averages, loses the speech the farther you go, until you head =\r\nstrange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the same to random static will eve=\r\nntually produce the same thing.  And random fluctuating square waves can so=\r\nund a bit like speech - or at least, you could have fun sharing with each o=\r\nther what you thing they &#39;sound like&#39;.\n\n\n\n\n\n        --- On Sun, 5/10/09, Mi=\r\nsty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulle=\r\ntbabea@...&gt;\n          Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n   =\r\n       To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n          Date: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 9:=\r\n29 AM\n\n\n                I always save the whole file in wav format then do =\r\nmy clips as mp3.

While some formats (like wav) can store the audio very =\r\nclose to the way it was recorded, formats like mp3 compress the file, and i=\r\nn so doing lose some of the sonic details.  This may not be a big deal in m=\r\nusic, where the audio is fairly clear to begin with.  But with sound source=\r\ns with a lot of noise (like evps), this can not only obscure any real sound=\r\ns, but pixelize non-sounds (like white noise) and make them start to sound =\r\nlike speech.\n\n                        So mp3 might be good for sharing the =\r\ndata, once you&#39;ve already formed an opinion based on an analysis of the wav=\r\n file.
