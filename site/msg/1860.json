Craig is excellent \n&gt;on the tech end of things.? We got a lot of white noise sound on 22, but it \n&gt;may be lack of signals in that area, as 22 seems to scan OK elsewhere.? The \n&gt;group is recording every week, so maybe we can get some progressive \n&gt;communication going.\n&gt;\n&gt;Rosemary\n&gt;\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;AOL now offers free email to everyone.
