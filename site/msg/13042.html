Mike how do you plan to do the experiment?
=A0
I have some thoughts on this=
.

You said you have some items.
=A0
Find a location out in the middle o=
f nowhere, and just bring your recording equipment. Try for 15 minutes to s=
ee if you can get any spirits.
=A0
Then go to that same location, lets say =
the next day and bring the items you have, and then try and record again fo=
r about 15 minutes.
=A0
It will be interesting if you then pick up a spirit=
 by just having the items with you.
=A0
With my radio I can not hear realti=
me, but if you have a device where you can hear real time, on the day you g=
o back to that remote location but with the items, if you do get spirits, t=

Hi Jeremy,

Thanks... I'll ch=
eck it out.

As an afterthought, to share this information I decided to pro=
bably put
together a video production of this entire event.

From UFO Geek =
Paradoc Productions. .. the paranormal documentary, "Final
communication fr=
om a fatal flight", or something like that. I decided
to start this during =
my vacation break later this month.
I'll even travel to the plane crash sit=
e point of impact, as well as
performing sessions with the debris in my lab=
.

I've heard that wires sometime retain imprinted information or
communica=
tion (like those old wire recorders).
Some of the wire bundle I have may ha=
ve contained communication or
electrical pulses just before the crash.

Thi=
s video will be the perfect time to test some of the paranormal
prototypes,=
 as well as a new one I designed, but haven't shared yet.
It's an ITC Syste=
m design that uses bright light, mirrors, lenses, along
with an optical cou=
pler and a few other surprises.

I have enough researched information and i=
tems to work with to put
together an hour long or more documentary.
I'll ha=
ve to see if Youtube will let me put more than 10 minutes at a
time on thei=
r servers, otherwise I'll have to break it up into parts.

This will all be=
 new to me, but it's worth the attempt.
