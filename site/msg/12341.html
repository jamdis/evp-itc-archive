<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting... so this device senses changing temperatures, etc and 
begins speaking differents words or phrases with these changes?

Humm... that 8-in-one paranormal box I put together a while back 
senses many different things also, but I never thought about putting 
those sensor inputs into a chip that speaks.  I now uses meters and 
lights, and alarms when the thing senses different things. But I&#x27;m 
guessing I can tap into the circuits and pick a place where the 
different voltages (ever changing) are and put those into the input 
of a speaking chip.

Humm... I may just have to open it up again and see what I can do...

&gt; &gt; I have a puck, and I have been getting the name Seth too.  I also

&gt; &gt; my puck give words that are not on the list.

&gt; &gt; Carol B.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for letting me know. Am I right that the puck list is the 
same
&gt; as the Ovilus word list?

&gt; &gt; My team has not yet purchased the Ovilus but I have been told that
&gt; it has the ability to form words that have not been programmed into
&gt; it. Since I have never used one, I am wondering what are the
&gt; similarities between the Ovilus and Frank&#x27;s Box. Could it be at all
&gt; possible that rather than just forming words or sounds based on
&gt; atmospheric readings, spirits are speaking through the Ovilus as 
they
&gt; do Frank&#x27;s box? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t mean to sound silly or presumptous, but I am very very
&gt; curious!! I am looking forward to purchasing the Ovilus as well as
&gt; the puck in the near future! Thanks for any feedback onthe Ovilus!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The Ovilus has the ability to form words in the phonetic mode, 
which I
&gt; was not using. Does it have the ability to form words in the
&gt; dictionary mode? I do not know. It would seem unlikely. Can spirits
&gt; speak through the Ovilus like they do Frank&#x27;s box? Maybe. Frank&#x27;s 
box
&gt; has a lot of white noise that can possibly be manipulated by spirits
&gt; into giving us messages, but the ovilus has words programmed into 
it&#x27;s
&gt; memory, it would probably take a lot more for entities to inject a
&gt; word into the computer&#x27;s memory than to inject a word into white
&gt; noise. A lot of the words that are coming through that are not on 
the
&gt; list is meaningless jibberish as the ovilus detects temperature
&gt; changes and has nothing to do with the paranormal. I do not believe
&gt; that the temperture changing could manipulate the components of this
&gt; device to the degree that would be needed to actually create words
&gt; like it is doing. I am betting if enough people catalog words that 
it
&gt; is saying we&#x27;ll probably wind up with another 500 or so beyond what 
it
&gt; was supposed to be capable of. 
&gt; 
&gt; I emailed the creator yesterday offering to send him sound files of
&gt; the words I am getting so that he can properly identify which of the
&gt; 512 words these are, but so far I have not heard back from him in
&gt; regards to this.

&gt; &gt; I have a puck, and I have been getting the name Seth too. I also
&gt; have had
&gt; &gt; my puck give words that are not on the list.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Carol B.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new here, but have been into paranormal research for 6 
years now.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am the type of person that never gets EVP voices with a 
recorder so
&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought I would experiment with things like the Frank&#x27;s box 
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ovilus. I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a cemetery 
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; field where a church burned down many years ago. I can not get 
too
&gt; &gt; &gt; specific without having people thinking I am making stuff up 
but it
&gt; &gt; &gt; got fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of the 
time
&gt; &gt; &gt; we were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of 
random
&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved over 
to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; field where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active and
&gt; &gt; &gt; started saying relevant words like cross and priest. The Ovilus 
was
&gt; &gt; &gt; MUCH more active when being used by our female member. Towards 
the end
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me told 
Seth
&gt; &gt; &gt; that she did not want to talk to you I&#x27;ve heard bad things 
about you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she 
started
&gt; &gt; &gt; feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head. 
Needless
&gt; &gt; &gt; to say we ended the session and got out of there.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Over the course of our investigation we found that the Ovilus 
was
&gt; &gt; &gt; saying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so 
yesterday I
&gt; &gt; &gt; did some test recordings to see what words would come up and 
one of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the first things that came up was: seth blamed rest I am not
&gt; &gt; &gt; gare demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me
&gt; &gt; &gt; concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am 
not even
&gt; &gt; &gt; storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the 
ovilus
&gt; &gt; &gt; saying this.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying 
aren&#x27;t on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the list, 
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Barry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words he 
is
&gt; &gt; &gt; getting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger list 
than
&gt; &gt; &gt; advertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; My most important question is is anyone else getting the name 
Seth out
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?
