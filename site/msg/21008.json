New group member Doug here, saying howdy from Oregon.\n\nHave any of you done anything with strain gauges or magnetic switches/relays as components of &quot;entity sensors&quot; for your ITC designs? I am prototyping a couple such devices, and would love to hear from anyone who may have gone down this path before.  I&#39;ve not been able to find anything on this approach to paranormal gear with my various Google hunts or digging through my modest library of paranormal technology books and schematics.\n\nAlso, I&#39;d like to hear your opinions on the potential value of a computer interface output from such a device.  My current prototypes have visible light LED outputs.  I record the output by simply videoing it with an extra camera on my 8-channel DVR that is used on client investigations.  But I&#39;d like something more elegant.  I could, with effort, produce encoded IR LED, RS232, USB, Wireless TCP/IP, or even BlueTooth output and direct it to a nearby computer.  Any comments on a preferred transmission means?  I am leaning toward the IR LED approach as a first digital interface solution because it&#39;s cheaper to implement.  But I am guessing that with an Arduino or STAMP, I could probably take it to the next level with a more elegant data exchange mechanism without too much difficulty.  \n\nAll suggestions welcome.\n\n- Doug Helbling"}
