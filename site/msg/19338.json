Most audio editors can reverse speech at a click these days, maybe I\n&gt; should try another one because I did not get anything playing a recording of\n&gt; my voice backwards.  I agree with you wholly that there is a distinction\n&gt; between mind and brain, most people overlook this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Nov 30, 2010 at 11:48 PM, Frank Sumption &lt;\n&gt; purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  I was doing reverse speech before EVP, and it works. Not only that,\n&gt;&gt; spirits and other entities talk backward too.  I had a reversing deck, but\n&gt;&gt; it broke in our move. You can record yourself, and reverse it, use it for\n&gt;&gt; psycho analysis. We&#39;re dealing with mind, not brain, so this stuff is\n&gt;&gt; universal.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; F-S\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Tue, Nov 30, 2010 at 4:05 PM, Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@gmail.com&gt;wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t know if you have heard of this guy, but John Oates has made a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; living claiming that reverse speech messages are the one way the unconscious\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cannot lie.  He also claims that reverse speech messages are almost always\n&gt;&gt;&gt; linked to the forward speech message.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Some of his examples are quite intriguing, but I don&#39;t buy it fully yet.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  I have recorded my own voice and played it backwards and got zilch.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; But, if there is some truth to it, maybe we should all be reversing some\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of our files from time to time just in case.  Wouldn&#39;t it be a startling\n&gt;&gt;&gt; find to have this be true not only of the living, but also in those who\n&gt;&gt;&gt; communicate through the box a well.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.reversespeech.com/Simple_Examples.htm\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;http://www.reversespeech.com/Simple_Examples.htm&gt;Tim\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Tue, Nov 30, 2010 at 5:46 PM, Frank Sumption &lt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  [Attachment(s)&lt;https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&view=js&name=main,tlist&ver=b1_WpQkzs8s.en.&am=!10dEyMHDV0SxhZ5ijtQ2BJKmLyOdKCgMTqG0rdjvFN8dECfogY-iKw&fri#12c9f0896c824766_12c9ef77032341cf_TopText&gt;from Frank Sumption included below]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just about yelling it now.
