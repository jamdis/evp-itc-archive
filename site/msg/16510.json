For instance, my father I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certain would&#39;ve told me to move the trees I&#39;d planted over the septic\n&gt; &gt; tank,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but would&#39;ve never said &quot;I love you.&quot; Maybe once he&#39;s dead, everything\n&gt; &gt; looks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different to him?

Why? Do last names cease to exist on the\n&gt; &gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; side?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or is there some unwritten rule that says verifiable information\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; passed along? If so, who makes and enforces these rules?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if they can so easily say a name four times in a row\n&gt; &gt; (yesterday\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was my friend&#39;s grandfather&#39;s name Donald), why can&#39;t they say one\n&gt; &gt; word\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me that would mean something? Or to my friend Heather? We both\n&gt; &gt; asked,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got nothing, at least not that we could discern. It would seem a\n&gt; &gt; simple\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing to say the word plumber (that was my dad&#39;s secret word) or\n&gt; &gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; single-syllable word.
