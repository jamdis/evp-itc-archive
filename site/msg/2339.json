It can be reached from a point of total relaxation or a type of trance st=\r\nate.\n\nPlease let me know if you can find those articles, I really am intere=\r\nsted in reading them.\n\nRegards,\n\nFrank R.\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom=\r\n: psi_research &lt;vilhellm@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: F=\r\nriday, September 28, 2007 12:11:51 PM\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] Re: A new gadget?\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n            We&#39;ve been using the K II for about a year a=\r\nnd a half and they&#39;re ok as a low cost emf \n\ndetector.

I have had \n\nthe meter &quot;pennied do=\r\nwn&quot; sitting on a table top, and have a toy in another room respond \n\nto me =\r\nwithout any activity on the meter.  I feel it is the spirit&#39;s choice and in=\r\n which manner \n\nit feels more comfortable in communicating with you.  I hav=\r\ne had lights turn off and back \n\non again in succession in response to ques=\r\ntions and no activity on the meter, and then I \n\nhave had no other response=\r\ns except the meter, so once again it is entirely up to the entity \n\nand how=\r\n it wishes to respond.  In regards to the new apartment building, check the=\r\n history \n\nof the land that it sits on.  In a few of my occasions it has be=\r\nen the energy tied to the land \n\nor former land owners that has caused the =\r\nactivity.  I have done an investigation in a &quot;new \n\nconstruction&quot; home site=\r\n that the family had not moved into yet and the activity was on the \n\nincre=\r\nase, the new owners bought this piece of property as a wooded lot with\n\n&gt;  =\r\nno prior establishment being on site, to anyones knowledge that is.  To all=\r\n of our \n\nsurprise, land records had nothing available for that property ot=\r\nher than the location and \n\nthe pertinent info, however further research an=\r\nd many phone calls later it was discovered \n\nthat the property sat on the e=\r\ndge of a local Indian tribal settlement from the 1700&#39;s \n\n(thanks to the De=\r\npt. of the Interior and the Bureau of Native American (Indian) Affairs.
