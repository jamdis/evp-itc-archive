&gt; Hi D&#x27;Ana welcome to the group. Depending on the size of the file 
you can attach them to email posts to the board or in files section 
or on esnips.com if it is a larger file. Gotta love those unexpected 
eye opening moments!

&gt;           Newbie here! my name is D`Ana, and i live in south texas. 
I recently 
&gt; got interested in e.v.p. due to the fact I have received it, 
without 
&gt; reason? Let me make sense of that! I was just video tapping my 
husband 
&gt; with my phone cam, and realize the video looks distorted, so i 
wasnt 
&gt; goin to use it, i thought a moving picture would be more real for 
&gt; others to see. Being friends far the past i had come into connact 
to 
&gt; because of the great ole myspace were wondering why I didnt have a 
&gt; picture of him up. keep in mind the t.v. wasnt on, except for the 
one 
&gt; he was playing a racing game on, and he turns the volume off of it, 
&gt; because it aint worth listening to if i am trying to watch my show, 
&gt; well i turned my t.v. off and went to video record him, and 
afterwards 
&gt; goin over it, i heard a very distinctive e.v.p. saying i love you.. 
&gt; nobody is talking, not even me, and you can hear it real well.. let 
me 
&gt; know how to send it and i will let the group see for themselves
