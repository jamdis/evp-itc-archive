I&#39;m Ray from Yorkshire England, \nI&#39;ve been doing research into EVP for a while now and always on the \nlookout for improved techniques and better results.  Just uploaded my \nfirst file under Ray&#39;s File&#39;s.  I obtained this EVP while exploring a \ndisused Lead Mine here in Yorkshire I was alone and armed with a torch \nand Olympus VN-120pc digital voice recorder.  If you loop the file you \ncan hear the noise of dripping water from the roof of the Mine and a \ndistinct voice saying &quot;help Me&quot;\n\nThanks\nRay"}
