We were just too well shielded for the boxes to\nscan properly.  I had on hand my Frank’s Ghost Box 22, Ron Ricketts’\nvery first Mini-Box to come out of production, the Radio Shack Hack,\nand a Craig’s Box, a modified Daewoo car stereo done by Craig Telesha.\n In addition, I had a gold-beryllium alloy antenna made by Marcus Leader.\n\nThere’s no doubt about it, the box technologies and spirit\ncommunication are hot topics, and will continue to be in the\nspotlight, especially as more people are able to obtain a device. \nHopefully, this will lay to rest the nonsense about a “circle of 30”\nor any such ridiculous claims of monopoly on who can and should use\nboxes.  Box technology is already democratic.  As more people obtain\nand work with them, many possibilities for coordinated research and\nexperiments will unfold.\n\nAs an interdimensional interface, the boxes are neutral.  They are not\ndark, demonic, negative, etc., as some fearful people worry.  Negative\nexperiences are always possible, just as in any work in the\nparanormal.  People who don’t know what they are doing, who are in it\nfor a lark, and who harbor fears and anxieties about the paranormal\nare not well-suited to any kind of paranormal exploration, whether\nit’s with a box, in automatic writing, or with a deck of Tarot cards.\n\nRick Moran, the executive director of the Association for the study of\nUnexplained Phenomena, the sponsors of the research for the Mini-Box,\nshared some observations with me after the show that illuminate the\ntopic.  Here are his comments:\n\nThere is a connection between every one of the designers/technicians\nwho have worked on the box from its inception by Spiricom. Every one\nof them was a licensed Ham Radio Operator, including Frank, Ron and\nMyself.\n\nSomeone asked about different antennas… because of the Ham connection,\nthat has been done already. The original Spiricom was an enormous\ndevice and operated on the ham bands because it was the only part of\nthe spectrum that could offer a clear channel. They tried both\nvertical and horizontal antennas. We did the same in our early\ndevices, both Ron and I have “antenna farms” as do many of the ASUP\ninvestigators, who are also hams.\n\nSpiricom sounded very robotic, due in part to the equipment being\nused… tubes and crystals to set the frequency. This was common\npractice through the 1980s.  I recently heard someone spouting a\ntheory that because the Spiricom used a crystal system, it was somehow\nmystical in nature. Crystals were used in all ham radios, all military\nradios and a lot of commercial applications… nothing mystical at all.\n \nI think Frank dropped the crystal frequency generation due to cost in\nfavor of a plain old radio tuner he pulled from an old receiver. Most\nof his designs were admittedly adaptations of junk radios, which is\nwhat separates his from ours. We spared no expense in designing\ncircuits that were critical to a clean signal.\n\nIn your discussion last night, George did not even mention the EARTH\nSOUNDS project at NASA on the Ultra Low Frequency Bands. Down there\nNASA has been hearing “voices” for years, which they admit, they can’t\nexplain. As you might have already guessed, that is one of our\nupcoming projects. The great problem there is the length of the\nantenna, to do it right an ULF antenna would be buried and would be\nabout 11 MILES long.  In the production model of the MiniBox, Ron hand\ntuned the antennas, winding row upon row of fine wire to match the\nnecessary length of the frequencies being scanned, another difference\nthat helped to eliminate noise and upgrade the voice quality.\n____\nThanks, Rick.  And thanks to Frank, Ron, Craig, Marcus and all the\nother researchers in the ITC field.\n\nRosemary"}
