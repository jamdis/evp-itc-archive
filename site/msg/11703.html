Chad,
My team uses 35 mm camera's as well as digital.
35mm's are a pain in =
the butt, ( but) they do work.
Even with the delay you can still get really=
 good pictures.
Keep using it . You will be surprised at what you can captu=
re.
Just wait until you go on an investigation, you will see.
Harold is sur=
rounded by the paranormal ALL THE TIME, so 
definately take lots of picture=
s around him.

I use a digital SL=
R (Cannon Digital Rebel xti) with a big flash
mounted on it either directed=
 up at the ceiling or with a diffuser
attached to avoid dust orbs. Occasion=
ally I also will set it for a
long exposure to capture some cool architectu=
re or something, but I
won't use any of those photos as evidence just becau=
se there are so
many normal things that can happen during a long exposure t=
o make
something odd show up in the pic. 
In most situations with the right=
 lens (I love my Canon 50mm f1.8) you
can adjust the iso and f-stop to take=
 a good picture in low light with
a fast shutter speed without needing the =
flash. If you don't
understand how all the settings (f-stop, iso speed, shu=
tter speed)
work together I'd suggest getting yourself a basic photography =
book or
taking a class at your local camera shop. You'd be amazed how many
=
"ghost pictures" will start just looking like camera operator error to
you =
after a while. haha
