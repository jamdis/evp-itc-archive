I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a cemetery and\nfield where a church burned down many years ago. I can not get too\nspecific without having people thinking I am making stuff up but it\ngot fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of the time\nwe were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of random\nstuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved over to the\nfield where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active and\nstarted saying relevant words like cross and priest. The Ovilus was\nMUCH more active when being used by our female member. Towards the end\nthe Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me told Seth\nthat she did not want to talk to you I&#39;ve heard bad things about you.\nAfter that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she started\nfeeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head. Needless\nto say we ended the session and got out of there.\n\nOver the course of our investigation we found that the Ovilus was\nsaying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so yesterday I\ndid some test recordings to see what words would come up and one of\nthe first things that came up was: seth  blamed  rest   I am   not \ngare   demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me\nconcerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am not even\nstoring this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the ovilus\nsaying this. \n\nAlso from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying aren&#39;t on\nthe list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the list, and\nBarry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words he is\ngetting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger list than\nadvertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.\n\nMy most important question is is anyone else getting the name Seth out\nof the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?"}
