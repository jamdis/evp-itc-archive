&gt; The
&gt; new 470 is all black and can&#x27;t be modified as of yet

Based on your comments about the 12-469, I&#x27;m going to pick up a 12-470  
later today. I called our local Radio Shack and the guy insisted that  
the new 12-470 is exactly the same as the old one, just the case is a  
different color (grey &amp; black). I specifically asked if the  
electronics were set up the same way and he said yes, they&#x27;re exactly  
the same. Do you suppose he&#x27;s right about that? Or just doesn&#x27;t know  
the product that well?

&gt; There is no pulsing on the older style 12-470, just clear
&gt; communication. My 12-469 is sitting in the corner and i&#x27;ll probably
&gt; never touch it again because that constant pulse noise is very
&gt; distracting to get past to hear any audible messages. That&#x27;s just my
&gt; personal opinion anyway for what it&#x27;s worth. If you listen to my
&gt; radio shack files from today you will hear the difference between the
&gt; two boxes. The sweep between the two are both linear, but one has
&gt; the pulse sound and one is just a clean sweep without the pulse. Ask
&gt; your local radio shack if they have any 12-470 older style models,
&gt; they are gray with a white top and also has a built in speaker. The
&gt; new 470 is all black and can&#x27;t be modified as of yet but i think Mike
&gt; C. could figure it out if he didn&#x27;t have 500 other projects going at
&gt; the same time....lol Any questions just shoot me an e-mail and i
&gt; will help the best i can.

&gt; &gt; Steve, hope your holidays were wonderful. We haven&#x27;t had the chance
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; speak in a few weeks.
&gt; &gt; What are the difference in the 469 and the 470 besides 2 channel vs.
&gt; &gt; 4? You are still choosing one channel and it is still a linear sweep
&gt; &gt; right? Technically, what would be the difference in choosing AM on
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; 469 and AM on the 470? The pulsing sound is absolutely annoying.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Had a pretty good session today, i&#x27;ve been pretty blocked with
&gt; other
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes yet i seem to always get great results with the RS 12-470.
&gt; Some
&gt; &gt; &gt; really good responses to my questions. Hey babs, i think you
&gt; should
&gt; &gt; &gt; give the RS box a little time and maybe you will start to get
&gt; stuff.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Although i have a 12-469 also and it really sux compared to the
&gt; 12-
&gt; &gt; &gt; 470. The constant pulsing noise in the 469 model just drives me
&gt; crazy
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough to not concentrate. Try looking for an older style model
&gt; of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; 12-470, that&#x27;s probably the best radio i own hands down. Instant
&gt; &gt; &gt; results always and consistently. All my boxes work, but they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; finicky sometimes. No need to comment to my posted files guys,
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; &gt; listen and see if i&#x27;m on some sort of a right track with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; communication.
