I can also see Bruce's side, to where the rest of us here has seen the Newbies same post and questions a thousand times, and then the other senior members have to weed through them.  I can see both aspects of the situation

          Hi Bruce. Just a thought.... It's really sweet of you to make yourself so available to people, 
but if you have members take inquiries of this nature off the boards by having them 
contact your privately, you are limiting the amount of learning that can take place. There 
are likely "lurkers" here, who will never join or come forward, but could really benefit from 
Lyn's questions and the answers she receives from the group. 

Taking communication privately also eliminates the possibility for her to receive multiple 
opinions. (not to imply there isn't a time for privacy!) ;0)

Like I said, just a thought.
