Radio staions are converted \nfrom whatever frequency they are on to the 455khz IF freq. for better \namplification, ans selectivity. When you adjust those you&#39;re screwig \nwith the IF pass band, which usually is not a good thing. You&#39;ll \nprobably notice other parts of the band no longer receive, or stations \nover lap. \nSo Now you need a 455khz oscillator, tune a staiton, and adjust the \ntransformer for strongest beat signal. \n\n The red core is the local oscillator, the white and black the IF \ntransformers. So you&#39;ll also need a freq counter to get the thing back \nin tune. \n\n Tehre is a sot onthe board where a wire can be added that helps the AM \nreception a little, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d recommend screwing with it.\n\n I think get a book on basic radio fundamentals. \n\n Frank-S\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Aaron &lt;a.cronk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I found an old 12-469 from RadioShack and compared to the newer one, \nthe\n&gt; reception is real bad. I opened it up and noticed red, white, and \nblack like\n&gt; screws. I decided to play around with them and noticed that it changed\n&gt; reception and how loud the stations come through. Has anyone else \nplayed\n&gt; with these? I&#39;m trying to adjust them to get better reception, but \ncan&#39;t\n&gt; quite get the reception the way I want it. Is there a way I can add a \ncopper\n&gt; coil or anything to boost the reception? I attached some images for \neveryone\n&gt; to see. Any suggestions would be great.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Aaron\n&gt;"}
