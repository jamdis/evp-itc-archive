I have formed an opinion that he is inclined  \n&gt; to control the message by reading his own words and hearing his own  \n&gt; words on the radio and on tapes of his sessions, and I cannot  \n&gt; logically interpret them in any other way. Since you don&#39;t agree, If  \n&gt; you would like to directly quote him to prove otherwise, then I am  \n&gt; always ready to modify my opinions. Truly. But I am not going to  \n&gt; change my mind without evidence.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t pull my opinions out of a void. I have seen what are, at this  \n&gt; point, *generations* of paranormal researchers try to control the  \n&gt; message and the process by saying that only the Special get to be  \n&gt; part of the circle or the gang or the team or the bridge, or  \n&gt; whatever. I have seen every single one of these units explode or  \n&gt; implode or turn into a nascent religion over the control issues of a  \n&gt; dominant person. I do not like this messianic behavior because it has  \n&gt; ruined what was otherwise a potentially profitable avenue of  \n&gt; research. Because I don&#39;t talk about my own history or abilities  \n&gt; often, and because I don&#39;t yet have a box, that does not mean that I  \n&gt; am not a hoary old raven with a hell of a lot of perspective on this.  \n&gt; I&#39;ve watched it happen again and again and again--thank goodness,  \n&gt; mostly from a distance.\n&gt; \n&gt; /HMO\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 30, 2007, at 6:30 AM, babiarz3 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; What you hear and the actual words being used are two different\n&gt; &gt; things.
