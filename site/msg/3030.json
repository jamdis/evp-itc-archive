But right now we don&#39;t even \nknow if their boxes work.\n\nAs a radio amateur, I have the philosophy that all the designs I do as a \nradio amateur and all the computer/microcontroller programs I write should \nbe given freely by me to others.  I&#39;ve even run off some pc boards and \ngiven them away free. I would tend to do that in this area (ITC) too as \nlong as it doesn&#39;t break me.\n\nSo I see your point. I guess they&#39;re just not altruistic like Frank S. is.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Fri, 16 Nov 2007, Frank Ratka wrote:\n\n&gt; How can it advance the technology if he doesn&#39;t share the design?\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank R.\n&gt;"}
