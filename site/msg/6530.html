<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, i didn&#x27;t mean to offend anyone with the suggestion of using 
Mp3&#x27;s.  I record in Mp3 format, so no conversion is necessary for 
me.  So, i&#x27;m not familiar with the loss of audio content in the 
conversion process from wav to mp3&#x27;s.  If you record in mp3 format to 
start with is it still losing audio?  I&#x27;m really not sure how it 
works with wav files and mp3&#x27;s other than the space is a lot more.  I 
think most recorders have an option with what file type to record 
with, i&#x27;m going to do a recording later and see if i hear the 
difference between the wav and mp3 for personal knowledge.  I may 
have been missing audio all along.


Thanx,
-Steve H.

&gt; Yep I agree with a few files there is some loss in conversion. 
Thats 
&gt; why I sent out that program because it has next to no loss in the 
&gt; conversion. But again I will say I would rather post 1 meg of files 
&gt; than take up the entire groups space by posting 15 megs of files. 
&gt; When I want to share more complete audio I just use my esnips.com 
&gt; account to do that. It is just as easy for people to click on my 
&gt; esnips hotlink in a notification post as it is to click on the 
files 
&gt; link to the left.
&gt; 
&gt; You are right we just have to manage ourselves better.

&gt; &gt; I post in wav. format I believe when you convert the file from 
wav 
&gt; to mp3.
&gt; &gt; certain aspects of the file are lost. If an mp3. file is a tenth 
of 
&gt; the size of
&gt; &gt; a wav. file where does the other 9/10&#x27;s go.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; If it is compressed then it definitely loses quality. 
&gt; &gt; I think every nuance in a box file is crucial for the 
&gt; &gt; correct interpretation of the file, sometimes the a word created 
by 
&gt; the entity is not only
&gt; &gt; comprised of radio fragment but also static noise mixed with the 
&gt; fragments of radio vocal
&gt; &gt; to form the message the entity wishes to leave. I don&#x27;t know the 
&gt; technical aspects of the file 
&gt; &gt; change but I think it&#x27;s common sense that when you try to pour a 
&gt; gallon of water into a shot glass
&gt; &gt; all you wind up with is a shot glass full of water the rest is 
&gt; spilled and lost.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; I keep my files posted for 5 or less days, just long enough for 
&gt; anyone that wants to listen can.
&gt; &gt; If your going to leave your files posted indefinitely and keep 
&gt; adding to the folder then of course it will
&gt; &gt; put pressure on the storage space.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; As far as posting a notice for every file, some of us may wish to 
&gt; listen from their e-mail or not 
&gt; &gt; have to go to the file section to listen, That&#x27;s probably why 
that 
&gt; option is given.
&gt; &gt; If I didn&#x27;t like the notices cluttering up my e-mail in box you 
can 
&gt; change that feature in the group
&gt; &gt; membership options. So if anyone does not want that feature they 
&gt; can turn it off and only read posts on the group.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s not the lack of space is the mismanagement of it by all of 
us. 
&gt; &gt; when I change my files from wav. to mp3 I hear a distinct 
&gt; difference, do it in an audio editor and you can visually see the 
&gt; difference.

&gt; &gt; That&#x27;s a great idea Steve and it was mentioned before but either 
no 
&gt; one noticed Misty&#x27;s post or it was ignored. It would be a shame 
&gt; though if people start loosing files because they are not paying 
&gt; attention to the owners instructions.Regards,Frank R.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Misty,I have and idea. One solution is to post Mp3 files instead 
of 
&gt; Wav. files or any other format. It seems like the Mp3&#x27;s sound the 
&gt; same and are only 1/10th of the size. I think that would probably 
&gt; clear up 90 percent of the board right there. If i actually have 
more 
&gt; than a couple files from here on out, i will be attaching them to 
an 
&gt; e-mail and not the board to save space here. And also, if people do 
&gt; post files maybe we can all just have one post that says we have 
&gt; uploaded files to our folder instead of 30 audio announcements in a 
&gt; row that just seems to waste a lot of e-mail space in the 
individual 
&gt; e-mails. And it also pushes the current topic on the board to 
another 
&gt; page and is lost for those who wanted to share. Just my thoughts on 
&gt; helping the subject. I know we are all excited, but misty is right. 
I 
&gt; went to add a file the other day and the group was at 93 percent 
&gt; capacity, so it won&#x27;t be long before we run out of space.-Steve H.--

Just 
&gt; a little friendly reminder that you all need to organize your &gt; 
files 
&gt; better in the files area. Space is limited here and you are all &gt; 
&gt; nearing the 100% mark so try to keep your section under 5 megs. If 
&gt; 
&gt; you need more space use www.esnips.com and you can store 50 gigs to 
&gt; 
&gt; share with the group or public.&gt; &gt; I think it is great you guys 
have 
&gt; so much to share I just wish that &gt; our yahoo group wasnt so 
limited 
&gt; on space (and that I wasnt so &gt; limited on time). But I have found 
a 
&gt; way around it. If just a few &gt; people signed up and shared using 
&gt; esnips they can invite others to &gt; visit thier files and once they 
do 
&gt; they also get 50 gigs of free &gt; space for audio pictures or video 
or 
&gt; whatever you want to post.&gt; &gt; I was considering setting up 
&gt; one &quot;group&quot; account to start with and &gt; inviting all members who 
post 
&gt; files to join it and be able to post to &gt; the account. It will 
&gt; automatically notify everyone thats a member &gt; when a file is added 
&gt; to it just like the yahoo group does. It also &gt; allows you to share 
&gt; with the public or privately if you so choose. &gt; You can even allow 
&gt; your friends to post to your account if you wish.&gt; &gt; This group has 
&gt; grown and expanded and we just need to make a few &gt; changes to how 
we 
&gt; do things to keep it running more smoothly for the &gt; future. I am 
&gt; hoping that you all will help me in this endeavor. I &gt; know many of 
&gt; you have already adapted the idea to help us organize &gt; and 
maintain 
&gt; the group.&gt; &gt; I want you to keep sharing and to be able to share 
&gt; more! &gt; &gt; So please organize and not post stray files that are 
&gt; targets for &gt; deletion once the que is 100% full. And for your own 
&gt; sake, if no one &gt; elses, be respectful to each other.&gt; &gt; MD&gt;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! 
Mobile. 
&gt; Try it now.
