The loud portion or\npossible fragment is just over three times longer than any other\nportion of the clip.  This means it is either very very broad band or\na very powerful transmission.  It is way to long in duration to be\nbroadband.  The FCC would never let a signal this wide be broadcast. \nAnd if its that powerful to saturate the front end of the receiver it\nwould 1, be very close to you and 2, be heard all the time!  I think\nthe fact that the time period of the signal is so much longer than\nthat of the scan rate proves this is something else.\nI use this method on my minibox and it seems to be holding up.\nRob.\nDeadscience.com\n-- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  This is kinda light blasted by the sunlight, but it&#39;s direct mode,\nno sound chamber, and using the lool antenna.
