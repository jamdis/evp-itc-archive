I have to admit though, I can certainly relate to the \nself butt-kicking ... been there, done that!!  ;-)  The BEST part is, you were there \nwitnessing the communication and it had a profound impact on you.  That&#39;s sacred, even if \nthere is no recording.  I&#39;m happy for you that you were able to have this experience (and I \nshare in your disappointment about the recording - because I can imagine how I would \nfeel in your shoes).

Bummer that happened. :0( \nMost of us computer users know the golden rule \n&gt; (besides BACKUP) is to save your session immediately so that if anything strange \nhappens, \n&gt; it will have been stored on the hard drive. LOL - I should talk! - I&#39;ve lost more than a \nfew \n&gt; sessions by ignoring this sage advice in the past, but nothing so spectacular as you \n&gt; describe. I record into my laptop too, with Audacity. \n&gt; \n&gt; I hope you have success tonight, and if you do, take two seconds to &#39;save&#39; your file the \n&gt; moment the session ends. Keep us posted!\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m guessing nobody believes me! O well I would like to tell you that it really is true, \nand \n&gt; I know in my heart, because I was there. Not sure why them cpu went off, but maybe I \n&gt; had too much infomation then they wanted me too.( I record write on to my laptop, and \nI \n&gt; don&#39;t use any type of digital or analog recorder). I will prove it again. Tonight I am going \n&gt; to do everything the same to see if I can get it to happen again.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rees\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; reesclarke_69 &lt;reesclarke_69@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hey guys\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I had the most amazing session last night. Me and my fiance \n&gt; &gt; did a session, and this is how it went. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We usally do 10 min. of audio, and during the session we first \n&gt; &gt; contacted a guy named Virgil, and we got him to say both of our \n&gt; &gt; names. He said &quot;William&quot; for me, and &quot;Leigh&quot; for Ashley. We all \n&gt; &gt; communicated for the 10 min. He didn&#39;t answer every question, but \n&gt; &gt; he answered 75% of all answerslast night. We told him that we \n&gt; &gt; wanted to prove that they exsisted on the other side. Life after \n&gt; &gt; death. He answer &quot;we are over here&quot;, very plainly. After the 10 \n&gt; &gt; min. We ask for confirmation so we could shut off the radio, and we \n&gt; &gt; got this answer &quot;that would be a bad idea&quot;. Which freaked Ashley \n&gt; &gt; out. So we kept the radio on and we had a conversation with this \n&gt; &gt; preacher, then while the band was still sweeping the preacher came \n&gt; &gt; through and he talked to us (while sweeping the band), and started \n&gt; &gt; to preach to us about our side, and how messed up it is.(the band \n&gt; &gt; was sweeping the whole time, I never stop the band from sweeping) \n&gt; &gt; He said that we needed to pray for our enemies as well as our \n&gt; &gt; friends and families. He talked to us for 6 to eight minutes. \n&gt; &gt; Then we finished the session (Ask for confirmation)when he didn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; come through any more. We shut down. Then of course I get up and \n&gt; &gt; put everything back the way it is supposed to be. Leaving the \n&gt; &gt; session that we just did on the laptop. Then I went to take a \n&gt; &gt; shower, and I come back. The laptop was turned off and I lost all \n&gt; &gt; of the session. Sometimes the computer will log itself off, then \n&gt; &gt; when you get back it is exactly the was it was when you left it. \n&gt; &gt; But this wasn&#39;t the case, some reason the laptop shut itself off, \n&gt; &gt; and we lost all of the evidence that we had. Didn&#39;t have nothing, \n&gt; &gt; and I couldn&#39;t believe that we lost everything. So thats why I am \n&gt; &gt; sitting here typing away about what happen last night. Instead of \n&gt; &gt; me posting files about what happen last night. I wish so bad that \n&gt; &gt; y&#39;all would have been able to hear the communication. It was a life \n&gt; &gt; changing experience. It made me think a whole lot different about \n&gt; &gt; box research. I still can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t save it before the \n&gt; &gt; computer turned itself off. That is what happen to me last night, \n&gt; &gt; and change box research for me for the rest of my life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; William Rees Clarke III\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Tired of spam?
