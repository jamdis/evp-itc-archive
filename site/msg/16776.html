<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all.  I am wondering, has anyone here ever gotten an entity through the box who mentions &quot;rules&quot; for speaking to the living, and if so, what were those rules?  I seem to vaguely recall mention of this somewhere, but can&#x27;t recall where.  Wondering if the rules are laws of physics, or laws enforceable by (insert deity name here).  

Frank, stop reading, because the next part assumes a belief in ghosts.

Reason I ask is, I was watching one of the better ghost shows on TV, and it got me to thinking about how paranormal activity often happens in the next room, almost never directly (unless it&#x27;s a deceased loved one, or a residual haunting).  Could this be because of those &quot;rules&quot;?  Could the reason entities lie so much have to do with the &quot;rules&quot;?

Thinking out loud here, so just ignore if I&#x27;m not making any sense.</pre>
