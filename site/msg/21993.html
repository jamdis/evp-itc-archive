Thanks Jamie, I am going to redo Part 1 and ask David if he could say the  =

Lord's Prayer for me and seal it, so it doesn't change.  These spirit's ca=
n  
sometimes change the words around to suit them you know, he talks mostl=
y 
via a  program he originally got from the Cross over talk system, we don=
't use 
that  much any more because he can fix what we have copied, and reu=
se the 
files if he  wants to.  He is becoming more understandable, maybe I=
 shouldn't 
say this  because he is very busy over there, it's like non sto=
p people 
coming in from  lower plains, (hundreds of thousands), that's one=
 reason they 
are not as  noisy as they used to be, because, before we all =
came along, they 
were running  away from the light of God, and he, JC had =
to seek them out, 
but now they  are seeking Him out, and are getting into =
that line over 
there.  I know, it  all sounds weird to me too, but that's =
what they say, at 
least there are no  "hell fires" over there, only darkne=
ss, it's like the inside 
of a warehouse with  levels, cement like ramps go=
ing through there, once 
they get in the light,  everything changes, it's l=
ike going home.  And yes, we 
do all keep our  identity.  David wanted me t=
o write this, and believe it 
or not they are  his words, and not my own:
 =

In fact no one would be happy in Heaven knowing  there are people "burning=
 
in hell" and if they were happy knowing this it would  be sinful right 
t=
here, think about it, to burn sinners is not God's way, God  does not sin. =
God 
is love, He loved us enough to die for His people. He  does not put si=
nners 
into "hell fires" to be in a place of darkness without the  light of=
 God is 
what the lower plains are all about.
 
"If I be lifted up I will d=
raw All mankind unto  me" Jesus does not give 
up, He does not put people i=
nto fires, there is NO fire  in the lower plains, 
only darkness, it's pitc=
h black, God is not cruel, if? God  did not love His 
creatures, He would s=
imply turn His head and we would all be  gone. Fire is 
expression of the H=
oly Spirit who is kind, God does not "burn"  creation in 
hell fires, they =
are people that do not believe, but God still  brings them 
into the fold o=
ne at a time, they must repent.
 
Heaven is not on one planet, "Heaven? is =
 everywhere, we just can't see it 
with our physical eyes." What you call "=
hell"  is only a place of darkness, 
and Jesus continues to draw those in d=
arkness into  the Light even now, 
there is no fire in "hell"  only darknes=
s. The "lake of  fire" you refer to were 
the fires in Gehenna, it was plac=
e where they burned  garbage in Old 
Jerusalem.  David The Tech.
