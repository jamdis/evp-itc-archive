But, they did use the itc video \nlooping\n&gt; method live as well as with the session on the radio.\n&gt; Thats all I could gather.\n&gt; They seem to have archived footage as well at the site after you\n&gt; register. \n&gt; I hope that helps. Let me know what the files give I sent ya.\n&gt; TC and thanks for being kind. \n&gt; \n&gt; LK\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; LK: Hi!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a question for you: Who was doing the session, btw, and \nwhat \n&gt; &gt; box did they use? :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hope you get better!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, LauraKimberley1@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi LC,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes I recorded the session in part about 1 hrs worth.
