Another way to look at audible scrying-

The random audio is like a fortune=
 teller's crystal ball.

That's is what they are doing when they read their=
 crystal balls-scrying.

  Yes-perfect ex=
ample of audible scrying.

  What's happening is that the random audio is j=
ust a background used for you to scry into. Infact, if this is what is happ=
ening, I bet if you could get the "Your mom is calling" message out of your=
 head and listen to that same track on another occasion, you may hear a com=
pletely different message.

  This could also be why Frank has reported tha=
t his messages change from what he first heard.

  In essence, it isn't the=
 physical recording sounds giving you the message, it is your subconscious =
mind.

    Okay I have another one =
for you to think about.. I tape a session and review it later..  even a day=
 later.  Upon review the message that comes over is about something that 'j=
ust happened' while I was reviewing or happened after taping?  Is it possib=
le that spirit can manipulate the recording AFTER recording has stopped or =
even manipulate the audio while reviewing?


    An give you an example of =
this I was recording one day and I reviewed the audio the next day.  While =
reviewing - about half way through - the message "Your mother is calling" w=
as found.  I saved it and moved on and within two seconds my mom called.  Y=
ou say it is a coincidence except that I hadn't spoken to my mother in over=
 a year.  During this same conversation with her - we sorta made amends and=
 I told her the story of the 'secret' I had found out about a family member=
 having a child out of wedlock in the late 1920s.  Quick backstory.. I foun=
d out about this out-of-wedlock birth through my genealogy research and con=
tacted spirit through the box and I was promptly told to keep it secret and=
 which I promised to do.


    Well in this conversation with my mom after =
not speaking for a year I told her what I had found out.  When the telephon=
e conversation ended with my mom. I was amazed that the recording had told =
me she would call right be fore she did - even though the audio was recorde=
d the previous day.  I proceeded to go back to reviewing the audio and the =
very first thing I heard was:  THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SECRET - YOU LIED.=



    Maybe they can manipulate 'real-time' literally????

    2 different things happening-that's why. When you get EVP that every=
one understands, it is outward, in the environment. Not a communication thr=
ough subconscious means.


    EVP that people swear they hear, but noone e=
lse can make sense, may be a message to them via subconscious means. That i=
sn't to say that ALL EVP's like this are true messages, I am sure alot are =
just matrixing.


    But then that is how the art of scrying starts-matrix=
ing. Like the Rorschach tests. The images you matrix with those gives the p=
sychologist an insight into your mind.


    By gazing into a dark, reflect=
ive surface, you start to see cloudy images. At first, you will just be mat=
rixing faces in the clouds and not getting much substance. Try it, you will=
 see what I am saying. With practice, you start to see clear, concise image=
s.


    I think that is what happening with audio as well.


    We alread=
y know for a fact pareidolia can occur in audio as well as visual stimulus.=
