Maybe you're not, but most EVP's you hear are just matrixng, which is why m=
ostly no one hears what the person recorded it thinks that they hear.

But =
your proof here is subjective. How do you  know for sure that it is your da=
d's friend?

I'm not trying to be argumentative-you may be right.

    Well, I would disagree with the idea I'm hearing w=
hat I want to hear. The first time I got my dad's friend Gordy, I didn't ev=
en hear his name; I thought he was saying "Forty, forty, forty." It was onl=
y in a later session that he identified himself again using his full proper=
 name. Then I realized that he is now dead (last I saw him he was very much=
 alive), and that he'd been saying Gordy all along (confirmed by playing ba=
ck the old tape). I certainly didn't expect to hear him come through, and y=
et he did, so I can't see how I could've expected to hear his name.
