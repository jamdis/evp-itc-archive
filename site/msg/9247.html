&gt;       Hello Margaret,
&gt;    
&gt;   Thanks so much for the replies.  (You replied to my previous email and I forgot to 
thank you. )
&gt;    
&gt;   The first EVP that I received was a fellow saying &quot;Peace&quot;. Before I do an EVP session I 
always say a prayer and use the quote used in Mark Macy&#x27;s book which basically says that 
I would like to communicate with others who would like to see others move closer to God 
in thought, word, and deed. I always add that I would like to communicate with those that 
come in Light, Love and Peace. He has said &quot;Peace&quot; twice now. LOL.
&gt;    
&gt;   I have my sweet wife listen to all of them also. The second EVP that I got was when I 
asked if there were any Spirits present. A woman, who sounded like she was in the living 
room said &quot;No, no Spirits.&quot; Then you could hear her walking on our hardwood floors with 
hard soled shoes. I figured maybe she didn&#x27;t know she was a Spirit. 
&gt;    
&gt;   The laugh wasn&#x27;t sinister. It just caught me off of guard. I have a Jack Russell Terrier, 
Molly, and I was playing with her, so it&#x27;s possible that the young girl was giggling at Molly 
or as you said maybe because she was on the tape. During this EVP Molly was just a 
staring at the right of us. I am sure she saw them. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Thanks for the input. I deeply appreciate it. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Many Blessings All,
&gt;    
&gt;   Jeremy

&gt;     Hi Jeremy. Congrats on such great EVP&#x27;s!! It hasn&#x27;t happened often, but I have heard 
&gt; laughing on both my own recordings, and that of others, but nothing there was nothing 
&gt; sinister sounding. And one time, I heard what sound like a kiss.
&gt; 
&gt; If the giggle sound was that of a young girl, maybe she was just tickled to be talking on 
&gt; the recorder? If you think about it, it&#x27;s very common for children to laugh and be silly 
&gt; while in the physical. Makes sense they would do that in spirit as well. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Again, congrats on getting clear messages so quickly. At some point, you&#x27;ll want to 
make 
&gt; sure others can hear some of them too. It&#x27;s not uncommon for something to be heard 
&gt; absolutely clearly by the person doing the recording but not heard clearly (or even heard 
&gt; at all) by others. I never really know how clear what I have might be until I get feedback 
&gt; from others. It&#x27;s my opinion that doing EVP work can definitely increase one&#x27;s 
&gt; clairaudience.

&gt; &gt; Hello Everyone,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am relatively new to this group. I have been studying about ITC
&gt; &gt; research and EVP&#x27;s for some time. I started doing EVP&#x27;s with my Sony
&gt; &gt; tape recorder about three weeks ago. So far, I have gotten many Class
&gt; &gt; A EVP&#x27;s.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; On Sunday, I did my recording from my bedroom. I am disabled and was
&gt; &gt; in quite a bit of pain that evening. I just listened to the tape a few
&gt; &gt; minutes ago and was astounded. I can hear a good friend of mine, Jean,
&gt; &gt; that passed in 1991, calling my name as clear as a bell. Then someone
&gt; &gt; else, whispers my name loudly into the tape recorder. After that you
&gt; &gt; can hear a young girl giggle. I think it was her that whispered into
&gt; &gt; the tape recorder. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I had tears of joy realizing that my good friend is trying to contact me. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Has anyone else had Spirits laugh or giggle on an EVP. That part kind
&gt; &gt; of made me nervous.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks everyone,
&gt; &gt;
