Dangers which Mankind faces if SPIRICOM is not used wisely\n&gt; \n&gt; Since his beginnings, Man has been faced with the fact that\n&gt; individually and collectively he has the power to act for good or\n&gt; evil. As his knowledge of the energetic nature of the cosmos has\n&gt; expanded, Man has found that every energy so far identified -- from\n&gt; sexual energy to atomic energy -- can be used for his benefit or for\n&gt; his downfall. He will find that the energies involved in SPIRICOM are\n&gt; also of a nature that can be used to help him grow mentally and\n&gt; spiritually and become more God-like (that is more like the beings on\n&gt; the higher planes) or they can be focused on trivia which will make it\n&gt; even harder for him to grow out of the present deplorable mess in\n&gt; which Western civilization&#39; s social, economic and political actions\n&gt; are tending toward disintegration.\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------ ----\n&gt; \n&gt; * For the spiritually oriented, we report some advice given by\n&gt; high level spirit communicators: If SPIRICOM researchers adhere to the\n&gt; following procedure they will not suffer possession by negative\n&gt; forces.
