Anyone that knows me, knows I have  \n&gt; given away my fair share of boxes\n&gt; to further the cause and help others get started in this wonderful  \n&gt; research.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have given and not even asked for the postage to be paid.\n&gt; But I payed a considerable ammount for the minibox as anyone that  \n&gt; owns one has.\n&gt; And I am still taking a loss, my only motivation here is that  \n&gt; someone get the box that will give it the\n&gt; attention that it deserves. But I would like to recoupe some of  \n&gt; what I paid.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think that is wrong, and do not see why I or any of my  \n&gt; friends should have to defend it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; From: lisby@...\n&gt; Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2008 13:20:37 -0400\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] My Ebay Price For The Mini-Box\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh, and I want to jump in here and say that if anyone thinks that  \n&gt; Bruce shouldn&#39;t try to get his investment in his mini back on ebay  \n&gt; or any other sales venue, I suggest practicing such charity oneself.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;\n&gt; On Apr 17, 2008, at 11:59 AM, Wiliam Clarke wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On the site of paranormal systems it give you an email that is Ron  \n&gt; Ricketts email.

They do however allow you to add and amending  \n&gt; statement.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Which I have done In Big Bold Red Letters, the price listing was a\n&gt; &gt; mistake. I am certainly not trying to misrepresent the item or  \n&gt; make a\n&gt; &gt; profit on it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have also lowered the reserve price on it as a result of the\n&gt; &gt; mistake.\n&gt; &gt; Believe me I will be taking a loss on the box.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have already sent my apologies to Rick Moran from Paranormal\n&gt; &gt; systems.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And now extend my apologies for the mistake to anyone that was\n&gt; &gt; interested in it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The reason for selling the MB was not the money, it was the guilt of\n&gt; &gt; having this excellent piece of equipment go without the attention it\n&gt; &gt; deserves. And the hopes that someone or some group can utilize it\n&gt; &gt; more than myself.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But I could not as much as I would have liked to, give it away.\n&gt; &gt; My intention was to get back at least a decent amount of my\n&gt; &gt; investment.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I hope no one gets the wrong idea and thinks ill of me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
