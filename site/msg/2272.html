This is the other women as she fades out as the tuning starts going beyind the channel she was on, if there was a channel.  There's multple images, but it's not blured to look like more faces like the other woman.

      Yeah, could be. In my old age, I have one good ear, and now the right eye has a spot, kinda ill equiped for this work. Can ya get motion blurs in video?

      Frank, I'm pretty sure that is not an additional person. It looks like motion blur of the same woman.
