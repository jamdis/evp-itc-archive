I can hear most of that. I hear a couple different words here and there but overall message is the same. For instance I dont hear I am the one. I hear "5 to 1" which reminds me of something they said before about 5 to one people dont hear perfect. I hear more around "gino" too. Good session.

File : /LC's RS 12-469 Recordings/questions_responses_yes_iam_gino.wav 
Uploaded by : lcdupla <lcdupla@...> 
Description : After I ask, "Would you please come forth and speak through the box?" I hear the female "Yes," and the male "Yes." I then say, "Yes?" Then you hear the male voice say, "Right." I then say, "Who's there?" and I hear a muffled "I am." I say, "Come again - over- can you repeat that?" Then I hear the male voice say, "I am. I'm the one." I then say, "You are? What's your name?" Then I hear the male voice say, "Gino."
