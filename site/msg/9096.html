<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Either that, or anyone willing to make them for $25 + shipping with 
no profit?  You could then list them just like the ones that are

&gt; I was thinking if someone would list a FREE DOWNLOAD of 
instructions for the various hacks 
&gt; on the Radio Shack units, it could put an end to the business for 
sellers that are taking 
&gt; advantage of people who are unaware that they could probably hack 
the units for 
&gt; themselves.  
&gt; 
&gt; I have seen &quot;downloads&quot; of various things listed before.  Why not 
this?
