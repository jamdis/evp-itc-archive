<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>So, if someone sick in the head ends up in a dark place, what happens to someone who has Alzheimer&#x27;s before they die?  (This is a serious question, btw, I&#x27;m curious if that would have any effect on where they end up...)  Anyone know?

&gt; seriously because David the Tech, says that this fella is &quot;sick in the head&quot;  when 
&gt; he was a little boy women had rapped him and he was later murdered as a  
&gt; teen.  He grew up over there, however he is mental, and needs prayer he  
&gt; doesn&#x27;t seem to have anyone to move him on.  David asked me to have you  folks 
&gt; all say a little prayer for Calib that he may get better over there, so he  
&gt; may move on, he is stuck in a partial dark plane because he has mind damage.
