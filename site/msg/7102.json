You cannot imagine (well, \nmaybe you can) what&#39;s involved in building stuff for frequencies above 47 \nGHz.\n:-)\n\nAll the recordings are fascinating and I don&#39;t post very often but I do \nlisten to them!\n\nZack\n\nOn Mon, 11 Feb 2008, Frank Sumption wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi All;\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering why some many that do this &quot;reseach&quot; go mash potatoes in the head, developing what seems to be that messiah complex. Box user after box user seems to go down this road. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just human ego, or they get possessed, or what. Maybe it&#39;s blinded by dollar signs!? Maybe it&#39;s like the Brookings Report, people just can not handle the truth on a psychological/ego level. I think that report applies to all encounters with  the vastness of the universe.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can&#39;t provide boxes for anyone else until I figure this stuff out. It&#39;s not ethical to give people something that has the potential of fucking them up, to be blunt. I wanted to give these boxes out to see how it worked for others, to see if they got something like I did, and so far it&#39;s very disappointing. It&#39;s almost like an experiment on people, except most were pretty much begging for, and demanding the things. Even if it&#39;s not the boxes per se`, that&#39;s even more reason to avoid the situation.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S"}
