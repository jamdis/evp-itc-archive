<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am heading to Radio shack after I get off work. I am taking the 
micro cassette recorder with me. The mic hole in the recorder is way 
smaller then the one that goes into the pc. The recorder is a Radio 
Shack recorder so hopefully they will have one.

&gt; Hi Rees.  This is a common item at Radio Shack.  I think you are 
looking for 1/8&quot; male 
&gt; connectors on both ends.  It runs about $5.  Do you have a store 
you can walk into?  Here&#x27;s 
&gt; one on eBay:

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve looked for a patch cord for a couple of months

the patch cord I 
&gt; described in my previous response ... connect it from the 
&gt; &gt; headphone jack on the recorder to the mic jack on your computer. 
Open Audacity (or 
&gt; &gt; whatever), hit the record button, then hit the play button on 
the recorder to play the 
&gt; &gt; session into the computer. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; When you&#x27;re done, press the stop button on the recording 
software, the stop button on 
&gt; &gt; the recorder itself, and then save your session. From there, you 
can begin to work with 
&gt; it, 
&gt; &gt; without worry of losing any data. Just be sure when you close 
the file DON&#x27;T SAVE 
&gt; &gt; CHANGES on the original, so you always have the raw version to 
refer back to.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can do this same thing with any recorder that has an 
earphone jack. Just go with the 
&gt; &gt; one you are drawn to. There are a bunch of them on eBay. If you 
are doing sweep, you 
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t even need a digital recorder, just plug in a mic into your 
computer and record on 
&gt; it. 
&gt; &gt; This saves you all the time and hassle of moving the file from 
the recorder into your 
&gt; &gt; computer. That&#x27;s what I do. You really only need a digital 
recorder for traditional work 
&gt; or 
&gt; &gt; portability (unless you have a laptop, which is pretty easy to 
take with you.) :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Can anyone tell what would be the best way to transfer a 
session I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; recorded on an older microcassette recorder to my computer? 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I did my first recorded session last night. All went great 
except for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the lousy reception. I didn&#x27;t realize just how much you miss 
during a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; real time session when you play back what you recorded. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I got two different Steve&#x27;s one sounded Australian and a Mike. 
I also 
&gt; &gt; &gt; got the number &quot;Seven&quot; I am sure there is lots more there but 
my 
&gt; &gt; &gt; reception was so bad I can&#x27;t hear everything.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also what would be a good digital recorder (relatively cheap) 
to get 
&gt; &gt; &gt; that you can easily transfer to your computer?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any help would be appreciated.
