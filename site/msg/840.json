Science \nis \n&gt; not our enemy, nor indeed is scepticism.\n&gt; \n&gt; Method\n&gt; What we want to find out is if there is any relationship between \n&gt; what the experimenter says and the type of EVP responses that we \nget.\n&gt; \n&gt; We are looking for signs of intelligence.\n&gt; \n&gt; We want to do that in a measurable way - for that is the way of \n&gt; science. And this is the way that has been approved by a major \n&gt; European pharmaceutical company for funding.\n&gt; \n&gt; We have six questions. These questions are decided on in advance. \n&gt; \n&gt; During the experiment the experimenter asks each of the questions, \n&gt; in turn, with a 30-second gap after each question to allow any \n&gt; responses to be recorded. \n&gt; \n&gt; So (for example) what you would get is,\n&gt; \n&gt; Question &#39;What is the time?&#39; \n&gt; [30 seconds delay]; \n&gt; Question &#39;What is your name?&#39; \n&gt; [30 seconds delay], \n&gt; Question &#39;What do you like best?&#39;\n&gt; [30 second delay]\n&gt; and so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now if an utterance is heard within the 30-second period and if \nthe \n&gt; utterance sounds as though it could be a response to the question, \n&gt; then it is treated as an actual response. For example if we hear \n&gt; the utterance &#39;John Smith&#39; seven seconds after the question &#39;What \nis \n&gt; your name?&#39; is asked, then that looks like a response to that \n&gt; question.\n&gt; \n&gt; The experimenter carries out the session, asking each of the \n&gt; questions in turn; and then the recording of the session is turned \n&gt; over to a speech analyst.\n&gt; \n&gt; The analyst picks out from the general background noise all the \n&gt; utterances he can find in the recording. He refines his search \n&gt; still further by selecting out the 16 utterances of the best \n&gt; quality. (sometimes it will be less than 16), and &quot;shuffles&quot; these \n&gt; so that you will not know which came first, which came second and \nso \n&gt; on.\n&gt; \n&gt; The final 16 utterances, their order shuffled, are sent out to you.\n&gt; \n&gt; What you are asked to do is decide if any of the utterances could \nbe \n&gt; a response to any of the questions, and to fill in a table like \nthat \n&gt; shown in the example below.\n&gt; \n&gt; Track No. Could be a response to Question Number�..\n&gt; BR01 4\n&gt; BR02 0\n&gt; BR03 0\n&gt; BRO4 3\n&gt; BR05 1\n&gt; BR06 2\n&gt; BR07 3\n&gt; BRO8 3\n&gt; BR09 6\n&gt; BR10 0\n&gt; BR11 0\n&gt; BR12 0\n&gt; BR13 6\n&gt; BR14 5\n&gt; BR15 0\n&gt; BR16 0\n&gt; \n&gt; As you can see some utterances are not considered to be a response \n&gt; to any of the questions, and so a &#39;0&#39; is inserted at that point. \n&gt; This is not an easy test, that is why you are being asked to help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please send your results to XXX@... and then they will get put \n&gt; into our database - and in time we will be told the results.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, however, preliminary results look quite promising and \n&gt; your assistance on this vital project is very much appreciated!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n&gt; Guy\n&gt;\n\n\n\n         \n\n  \n---------------------------------\nLooking for earth-friendly autos? \n Browse Top Cars by &quot;Green Rating&quot; at Yahoo!
