There will \nNOT be an increase after the first of the year.\n\nI want it to be affordable for those who can&#39;t build their own. \nDuring a recent session I asked the box what it should be sold for. \nIt replied. &quot;always 399&quot;. \n\nSo it will remain at $399.\n\nMerry Christmas to all,\nRon\n\nparanormalsystems.com\n\n\n \n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Leslie,\n&gt; \n&gt; To get you started...\n&gt; \n&gt; Mini Box - (about $400 - $500)\n&gt; http://www.paranormalsystems.com/The_MiniBox.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank&#39;s Box - (Not for sale, he offers them to people every once-\nin-\n&gt; awhile)\n&gt; http://www.franks-boxes.com\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many other websites that offer information on Franks \nBox, \n&gt; too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Joe&#39;s Box - (Price ???)\n&gt; http://www.keyportparanormal.com"}
