In reality, I believe most who conduct GBC can/could communicate witho=\r\nut such devices. It becomes a matter of training, experience and preference=\r\n. Working with the GB has allowed my own intuitive, clairvoyant, clairaudie=\r\nnt and clairsentient gifts to become more fully developed and that&#39;s not to=\r\n mention=C2=A0the immense joy I and others have=C2=A0gained through this wo=\r\nrk and it=C2=A0is, in a very large way,=C2=A0because of YOU my friend. \n=C2=\r\n=A0\nI&#39;ve been feeling more and more lately that GBC does indeed happen, for=\r\n the most part, in the user&#39;s brain. I believe that our unconscious self an=\r\nd subconscious mind has things it wishes to communicate to us at a consciou=\r\ns level. \n=C2=A0\nWith the box we get a never-ending supply of raw audio tha=\r\nt our minds can use to &quot;realize&quot; (perceive) things that only makes sense to=\r\n us, the individual operating the device and GB sessions. I think that what=\r\n we find, hear and become receptive to during our sessions...all that we &quot;p=\r\nick out&quot; of a recording are things the unconscious self wishes to make know=\r\nn to the conscious self. \n=C2=A0\nThe audio matrixing principle, phonologica=\r\nl ambiguities and auditory un-clarities resulting doesn&#39;t take anything awa=\r\ny from the information and messages which come through. We hear the parts, =\r\npieces and patterns that we&#39;re supposed to. The voices, messages and inform=\r\nation that each of us is drawn to is, in some way, exactly what the subcons=\r\ncious mind wishes to communicate to us and we hear it just as we&#39;re suppose=\r\nd to. \n=C2=A0\nSome people might perceive these messages=C2=A0as originating=\r\n=C2=A0from spirit or ET&#39;s or &quot;The Great Field&quot;...whatever it is and by whic=\r\nhever name seems to &quot;fit&quot; and make the most sense to the individual. \n=C2=\r\n=A0\nI think in many ways that we are ALL right!\n=C2=A0\nIf all there is IS &quot;=\r\nmind&quot;, thought, consciousness, light, energy and endless fields of pure inf=\r\normation...if everything is connected by one quantum field, one Source of e=\r\nnergy and one point of origin (The Big Bang, Intelligent Design, Divine Hap=\r\npenstance, a total fluke=C2=A0or whatever the case may be!) then I&#39;m far le=\r\nd to believe that our minds are connected to ALL of it and will continue to=\r\n use whatever methods, mediums and forms are at our disposal to assist with=\r\n that communication. \n=C2=A0\nWhat you&#39;ve said here doesn&#39;t invalidate anyth=\r\ning for me, personally.
