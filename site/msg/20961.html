<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well , I think you didnt understand me . My question was , What must be conected to pins 4 and 11 ? What voltage ? ... I didnt know if , for example , pin 11 must be conected to 0v (ground level), or to
 -12v , That was the question . (I know perfectly read a datasheet )

&gt; Rule #1 of being an EE: Always get the data sheet. Most manufacturers
&gt; have the data sheets available free for download as pdf files these
&gt; days. Back in the old days we had to request them and wait for several
&gt; weeks until they arrived in the mail.
&gt; 
&gt; You can do a Google search for a part number and it will usually come
&gt; up with a link for the data sheet unless it&#x27;s a really old, obscure
&gt; part by a manufacturer that isn&#x27;t around anymore.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Hi , i have an important question , is about linear sweep circuit , whith
&gt; &gt;&gt; opamp tl074 , the squematic dont say where must be conected the pins 4 and
&gt; &gt;&gt; 11 , 11 is - amd 4 + .  How is the conection ? ... 11 to -12v or 0 . 4 to
&gt; &gt;&gt; +12 ? .... I tried , and conecting 11 to 0 v , i got a triangular wave ,
&gt; &gt;&gt; but , i couldnt get a apropiate dc level , the minimum level i got was
&gt; &gt;&gt; almost 14v , when i tried more low dc level , the wave lose the form , and
&gt; &gt;&gt; the offset pot didnt go ok , it didnt have any effect in triangular wave .
