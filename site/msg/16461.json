I thought she was\n&gt; someone off the group and has an interest in EVP and the boxes. She did\n&gt; mention she was a skeptic, but I didn&#39;t think debunker, or a professional\n&gt; skeptic--wonder who pays these twits?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  These skeptics don&#39;t allow themselves to hear anything, yet will proclaim\n&gt; that as proof the boxes and EVP don&#39;t work, as if their hearing is somehow\n&gt; better than the average persons ear. If a person doesn&#39;t want to hear it,\n&gt; they won&#39;t, and because they can&#39;&#39;t hear EVP that means no one else an\n&gt; either.
