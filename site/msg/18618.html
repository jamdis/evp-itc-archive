<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Many people here don&#x27;t seem to understand anyone else. I&#x27;m beginning to
wonder since people can&#x27;t even understand things sent by other living people
by e-mail, how can they understand anything spirits are trying to
communicate?

This is scary.

&gt;  I think groups pretty much useless. Everyone has a damn opinion that is
&gt; gospel truth. Then the freaking skeptics- that no one can question when they
&gt; say this all imagination, and when we question them we are attacking. Figure
&gt; that crap out! Arrogant idiots. I&#x27;ve reached my saturation point, y&#x27;all can
&gt; have this shit.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; attacked ?? Wow , how dramatic... It&#x27;s just a fact that you will make
&gt;&gt; Frank mad again.
&gt;&gt; For instance: IT is very obvious that when Frank gets something from the
&gt;&gt; box about
&gt;&gt; stuff that says what is going to happen, YOU have to say I will add that
&gt;&gt; to your predictions.
&gt;&gt; Those are not Frank&#x27;s predictions, he is just posting the messages, and it
&gt;&gt; is very clear
&gt;&gt; that he does not like you saying or posting that those are his
&gt;&gt; predictions.....
&gt;&gt; Maybe you should pick your words a little better in the future, or better
&gt;&gt; yet, maybe you should just
&gt;&gt; not say anything, and just put the info in your little files to save, and
&gt;&gt; no one would be
&gt;&gt; the wiser..
&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m tired of giving you so much time in this group, so I hope I don&#x27;t have
&gt;&gt; to ATTACK you anymore LOL

&gt;&gt;   BTW, if anyone is wondering what I am talking about, this was a good
&gt;&gt; example.
&gt;&gt; I offer a suggestion on getting things back on track with less hostility,
&gt;&gt; and I am immediately attacked for making the suggestion.

&gt;&gt; that would be fine, if you didn&#x27;t piss Frank off....... But you do.....
&gt;&gt; AND THAT IS NOT OKAY.....
&gt;&gt; The same thing will happen when you do it again....
&gt;&gt; So what&#x27;s the point in you being here.

&gt;&gt; I expect none of us like all the recent attacks, insults, accusations,
&gt;&gt; threats, hurting of feelings, and attempts to piss people off.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can I suggest we stick to the purpose of the group: &quot;the discussion,
&gt;&gt; promotion, and developemnt of Electronic Voice Phenomenon, and Instrumental
&gt;&gt; Transcommunication methods and technologies as used in the communication
&gt;&gt; with spirit, and other entities.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And that we go with Frank&#x27;s philosophy &quot;just take the approach, try
&gt;&gt; different methods, see what works.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; No more threats. No name calling, insults, or accusations. Just try to
&gt;&gt; keep a positive group attitude, be open that not everyone believes what
&gt;&gt; everyone else does, and that&#x27;s ok?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;

Many people he e don&#x27;  seem o unde s and anyone else. I&#x27;m beginning o wonde since people can&#x27; e en unde s and hings sen by o he li ing people by e-mail, how can hey unde s and any hing spi i s a e ying o communica e?
