Yeah it was quite an evening at the \nStanley. It was like the history of Frank&#39;s Box with v15 through v25 \nalong with the MiniBox all in the same place. \n\nRegarding the Mini, even though it looked pro built in person it&#39;s \nall about the communication recieved through a Box that is most \nimportant. I didn&#39;t get to spend a lot of time with it or hear a \nmessage from it while I was there but it&#39;s interesting that April \nmentioned the Mini had called her name already and yours. That \ntendency to identify people seems consistant with all of them so \nmaybe the Mini will work out fine. The ones Steve H. builds also seem \nto work ok. -B\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@...m, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks! I had a good time as well. Still don&#39;t believe in hauntings \nthough. I got home about 4am. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Share life as it happens with the new Windows Live.Download today \nit&#39;s FREE!\n&gt; http://www.windowslive.com/share.html?\nocid=TXT_TAGLM_Wave2_sharelife_112007\n&gt;"}
