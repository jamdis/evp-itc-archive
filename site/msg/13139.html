Hello everyone

My name is Brian and I just joined the group to better understand how the box works. I know it's a subject that has been in the paranormal community for some time now. They are a lot that don't believe in the box and think that it's a lot of hogwash. All I can say is that people thought, that the Wright Brothers where crazy to think they could fly,  and where are we today! So I look at the box as a possibility and would like to better understand how this box may work.

One of my first questions is, what does ITC stand for?

I know what EVP stands for (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). 

I am not a paranormal researcher nor do I belong to any ghost hunting/research group but, I do have a strong interest in it. My wife and I will go out at times to graveyards and/or place looking for paranormal activity. We did get some EVPs at once with a digital recorder.

Thank you,
~Brian
