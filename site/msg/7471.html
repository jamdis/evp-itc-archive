Michael,

Your not nuts or dumb, those terms for the most part (excluding the minibox) originated on this board. The minibox is a creation of Ron Rickets, an electrical engineer out of Arlington, TX. The Shack Hack as it has become known is a modified digital radio from Radio Shack. Both of these devices work similar to Frank's box with some advantages and some disadvantages. 

The Minibox can be found at paranormalsystems.com

The instruction on how to hack the radio shack  radios, models: RS 12-469 and RS 12-470 (older version) are located at: http://www.ufogeek.com/ look under the subtitle (to the left) of Ghost Box.

Regards,

Frank R.

Boy do I feel dumb reading about the terminology of Hacked Shacked and mini boxes.
   
  Are these just personal names for a Franks Box device, or do they exist? I have searched in Google for these, and find nothing.
   
  Id like to try what all of you are doing, but do not have a box/device.
   
  Does radio shack sell one?
   
  I have two old am/fm dial radios from the 1960's that work quite well. One is a WW radio that has AM/FM stations in addition to SW.  Can I use these, and can someone give me some pointers to help get me started?

always starting a question and stopping because they're suddenly
coming through so loudly. Of course, when I stop, so do they... :(
