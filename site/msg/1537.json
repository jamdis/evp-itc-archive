I still \nstill need to rework the White Noise amp, but it&#39;s harder to get to being on \nthe underside of the board. This one is battery powered.\n\nThere&#39;s enough people wanting boxes that who to give them to without dissing \nanyone is a problem. These are the same as all the others I&#39;ve given away. \nThey were made as proto types to test ideas, mostly different ways of \nconstruction, after they are built, I always want to move on tho other \nideas.\n\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nLocal listings, incredible imagery, and driving directions - all in one \nplace! http://maps.live.com/?wip=69&FORM=MGAC01\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_37f1_70b5_2193\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;12-Front.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;12-Front.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_37f1_70b5_2193\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;12-TunerReplaced.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;12-TunerReplaced.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_37f1_70b5_2193\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;External-EchoBox.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;External-EchoBox.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_37f1_70b5_2193--"}
