He has some pretty interestingdiscussion on the Cosmic Code, life after death, UFOs, and many other topics. \n&gt; \n&gt; PTN is also accepting submissions by others in the paranormal to share your evidence, broadcast your own shows, and share with your paranormal community. Whether you are into ghost hunting, ufo&#39;s, cryptozoology, mediumship, astrology, or anything else in the paranormal realm they are willing to cover it all.\n&gt; \n&gt; John Zaffis, Jeff Belanger, Rosemary Guiley, Bonnie Vent, CC Carole (The Huntress) as well as many others are now hosting shows there. Scared Tv, Paranormal Quests, Haunted Earth, Seekers of the Paranormal, the list keeps growing. It&#39;s an amazing site to be able to watch paranormal shows 24/7 as well as partake in some of the live events. Some of our own group members are adding to the mix over there. There is much more coming!! I find it exciting watching how fast they have grown in such a short time.\n&gt; \n&gt; They are looking for people interested in covering the EVP-ITC aspect as well so if you are a researcher who is interested then you can submit your video/show ideas to them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope to see ya there!\n&gt; Misty\n&gt;"}
