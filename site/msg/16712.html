<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No, we currently do not have a box.   I was looking into a tube of some sorts.  Somebody on here mentioned it to me, so I think for a quick fix it would work.  I will look into a hacked radio shack radio.  I looked into them once and thought it seemed almost too simple.  LOL.   I will grab and hack it if I can find one locally.   My investigation is this Wednesday so I have to get it quick.  I will let you all know for sure what happens.

&gt; So you currently have no box?  If you can purchase one of the little boxes at Radio Shack and modify it, these work really well, and it only takes five minutes to hack.  See Steve&#x27;s website (if you haven&#x27;t already):

&gt; &gt; I love this discussion group.   There is so much information here it is hard to process all of it.  Currently, I am working on building a Frank&#x27;s box for my paranormal group, however, I am looking for some other home made type equipment to have for our investigation this next week.   We currently have IR cameras, EMF detectors, tons of audio recorders and many different cameras.  Is there anything else we should have or be using that anyone can think of??
