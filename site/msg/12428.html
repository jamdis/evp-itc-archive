<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, I&#x27;m game for organizing one in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area for
anyone that&#x27;s interested.  

If enough people from the group are interested in their locations, we
can start putting a meetup list together for the files area.

&gt; Great idea. Every Saturday...my house...Campeche, Mexico. All are
invited...No fee. I am serious and the invite is openfor any
willing travelers. We can conduct a session at one of the Mayan
Pyramids near my home. ron

&gt; Maybe we can set up specific locations and dates across the US (and in
&gt; other countries for people here from outside the US) for general
&gt; meet-ups. Call it &quot;boxapalooza on tour&quot;, or whatever you want. Have
&gt; a meet-up on the west coast, the Midwest, the east coast, etc. Ego&#x27;s
&gt; and &quot;names&quot; checked at the door, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; There&#x27;s also the option of regular city specific monthly meetings as
&gt; well. Similar to how the hacker/tech magazine 2600 has user
&gt; groups/meetups -

&gt; &gt; This distance issue has been a bummer for all long time researchers. 
&gt; &gt; The only answer I can see is to simply meet up. I&#x27;d suggest doing so 
&gt; &gt; minus those known to proclaim themselves &quot;experts&quot; or &quot;certified&quot; as 
&gt; &gt; such claims are ridiculous.
