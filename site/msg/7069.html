<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think sometimes our own minds, or psychic ability used the sound 
as kind of a psychic prop. I have what you describe happen often, as 
well as voices that seem perfectly clear, yet no one else can hear 
them. it&#x27;s confusing!

&gt; Now that I&#x27;ve been at this for a week, I&#x27;ve got a ton of questions 
&gt; (well, OK, maybe 5 or 6).  I&#x27;ll try to check the archives to make 
sure 
&gt; these haven&#x27;t already been discussed to death before I ask.  Also, 
is 
&gt; there a FAQ I could look at?  OTOH, it may be helpful to have basic 
&gt; questions revisited from time to time in case anyone has come up 
with 
&gt; new ideas about them.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, first question -  I&#x27;ve had a couple of instances where I 
heard a 
&gt; response loud and clear at the time, but on playback, the words are 
&gt; actually quite faint.  Is there a technological reason for that?  I 
have 
&gt; a decent degree of psychic ability and am working with a spirit 
whom 
&gt; I&#x27;ve been communicating with telepathically for over a year.  Is is 
more 
&gt; likely that I am picking up on the answer psychically as well, 
which 
&gt; amps up how I perceive it at the time?  And would his communicating 
with 
&gt; me psychically divert some of his energy from the ghost box 
&gt; communication, which would also explain why it came through fainter 
on that?
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t want to exhaust you with a bunch of questions all at once, 
so 
&gt; I&#x27;ll save the rest for later.  You&#x27;d start to feel like you&#x27;re 
dealing 
&gt; wit a 5 year old - &quot;Why, why, why, why, why?!!!&quot;  =)
