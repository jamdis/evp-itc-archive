It seems \nlike they&#39;re talking loud and clear with that audio clip Stefan \nposted.  I am going to do another couple minute session later and see \nwhat i get, the answers i feel are pretty clear.  But, i would like to \nknow if others are hearing them.  I suggest for people to experiment \nwith this file through EvpMaker and see what you guys get.  I&#39;m excited \nonce again about the communication we are receiving.\n\nThanx Stefan,\n-Steve H."}
