<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, I just had to answer this one!
First an foremost, Because of a persons nationality....does not make
them susceptible to the swine flu or other diseases!!
I am in Mexico, and folks, this country is poor and just like the USA,
go take a drive under your bridges and look at the homeless
shelters.....they are probably full....they refuse to work!! at least we
have people willing to do what it takes to survive!! Some monies is
absolutely better than nothing!! So, I am sure the food is still
fine.....it&#x27;s bought pre-made from the distributors, they just heat and
cook......good grief...relax......we will all be fine.

&gt; &quot;Q: How do I know if I should see a doctor? Maybe my symptoms are from
something else  like pollen?
&gt;
&gt; A: Health authorities say if you live in places where swine flu cases
have been confirmed, or you recently traveled to Mexico, and you have
flulike symptoms, ask your doctor if you need treatment or to be tested.
Allergies won&#x27;t cause a fever. And run-of-the-mill stomach bugs won&#x27;t be
accompanied by respiratory symptoms, notes Dr. Wayne Reynolds of Newport
News, Va., spokesman for the American Academy of Family Physicians.&quot;

&gt; The US has not reported any swine flu fatalities yet.  That doesn&#x27;t
mean there won&#x27;t be any.  But the reason that so far that flu has been
less serious in the US is speculated to be due to better treatment and
earlier prevention.

&gt;  Curiously--- it seems like it&#x27;s only fatal to Mexicans---hmmmm, could
old Unlce Sam be trying an imigration solution. Don&#x27;t get me wrong--I
don&#x27;t care who comes into this country-if they are being hired--what
would any of us do in the same situation?   Point is, that almost has to
be an engineered virus.   BTW, I&#x27;ve had an itchty throat sine Saturday.

&gt; Yup...seems to be a type of new flu that is a combination of avian
(bird) flu plus swine.   There are already people affected in NYC,
California, and Kansas...lowly state, and TX. There are a bunch who have
died in Mexico from the illness.
&gt; Scary part is that the folks in Mexico were healthy, happy, living
their lives and then WHAM! They had a headache and ached and later
death.
