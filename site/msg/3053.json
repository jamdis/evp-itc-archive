Katrina is still claiming her bounty here,  too,  not only in deaths,  but  with sanity, also.  I,  for instance, am on a steady diet of three psychological medications,  have been for the two years since.  I am not alone in this,  not by a long shot.   And my doctors do not give me much hope of improvement.
