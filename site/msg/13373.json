So for my own sake, I&#39;d like to know&lt;br&gt;the real story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have a link to where you got your information from his&lt;br&gt;assistants and staff, I would really like to read it. Please make&lt;br&gt;sure it is as close to the source material as possible, and not&lt;br&gt;someone quoting someone quoting an article. For example, here is a&lt;br&gt;link to the actual New York times article on Edison discussing his&lt;br&gt;views of life after death: &lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;\n href=&quot;http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9903EEDC1F39E333A25751C0A9669D946196D6CF&quot;&gt;http://query. nytimes.com/ mem/archive- free/pdf? _r=1&amp;res= 9903EEDC1F39E333 A25751C0A9669D94 6196D6CF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is the kind of link I&#39;d be hoping for regarding your statements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for any info.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rj&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;threadsintyme@ ...&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;Threadsintyme@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; When Moon starts to walk on water, change water to whine, heals the&lt;br&gt;sick and and lame and balances our national budget is when I will&lt;br&gt;believe this type of hype!! &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;John is joined in his mission by Chris Moon, an expert in all&lt;br&gt;things paranormal and possessor of Thomas Edison&#39;s mysterious&lt;br&gt;`telephone to the dead&#39;&quot; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The only problem with this hype is that there is no and probably was&lt;br&gt;never a telephone to the dead.
