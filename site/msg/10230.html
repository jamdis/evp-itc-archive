<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello all. It&#x27;s that time again for me to remind you that the group 
is low on space (96% used) and actions will be taken. For now rather 
than delete everyones files I am asking that you convert your wav 
format into mp3 or smaller format before you post them to the files 
area.

One member using 10+ megs out of our groups 100 total megs just isnt 
going to fly anymore. So starting in May all files that are not 
within size limits and arent in smallest formats will have to start 
to get deleted.

For those who cant convert your files I have programs that are free 
to help you do that. For those that dont want to convert your files, 
you can use esnips to post your larger files and share them with the 
group as links in posts. For those that ignore my posts and do what 
you want to anyway, your stuff will be deleted and your option to 
upload and share here in group will be disabled.

As I said we have 100 (one hundred) megs total in file section for 
sharing, please do not abuse your share of that space. As you can see 
there are others who like to share too. Eventually we may just clean 
it out of everyones files but for now lets try and stick to 
compacting the things we upload and make use of places like esnips 
for sharing.
