Everyone to a cer=\r\ntain extend is &quot;sensitive&quot; at varying degrees. &quot;No one is born spiritually =\r\nequal!&quot; All you have to do to record EVP&#39;s is to accept the possibility tha=\r\nt EVP is possible. That alone puts you in the mindset to receive.\n\nAs for t=\r\nhe technical aspects concerning EM and other measured anomalies, I have ext=\r\nensive experience in this field. Before I became a &quot;true believer&quot;, I was v=\r\nery much a tech head. Nothing was possible without a scientific theory or l=\r\naw backing it up. A very narrow way of thinking, let me tell you. It took a=\r\n couple of physicists (Dr. H. E. Puthoff and Dr. Michael Ibison) to teach m=\r\ne that science knows nothing beyond the ground is hard and water is wet. Ev=\r\nerything in science is a &quot;best guess&quot; or assumption based on a few well doc=\r\numented tests. \n\nIf you wanna know more about how EVP and audible speech is=\r\n formed in the physical atmosphere, look into the work of Dr. Orhan Berktay=\r\n and more recently Dr. Joseph Pompeii. Both are highly respected in both so=\r\nnar acoustics, heterodyning and ultrasonics. Dr. Pompeii (formerly of Bose,=\r\n graduate of MIT) describes and demonstrates the production of a highly dir=\r\nectional, audible sound in three dimensional space. He can make musicor voi=\r\nces play in a two foot bubble, five feet off the ground where only you can =\r\nhear it and a person three feet away will not. He does this by embedding an=\r\n audible signal within an ultrasonic carrier wave. Instead of allowing the =\r\nair (actually water vapor) to demodulate the carrier wave naturally, he dem=\r\nodulates it himself through technology at set distances determined by his p=\r\nrogrammed settings. His invention is called the &quot;audio spotlight&quot;and is bas=\r\ned on the work of Dr. Orhan Berktay&#39;s equation for underwater sonar in reve=\r\nrse.\n\nWhile reading his research you will notice several uncanny similariti=\r\nes between the anomalies produced by the &quot;audio spotlight&quot; and EVP.\n\nRegard=\r\ns,\n\nFrank R.\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: delchay2005 &lt;azredant@aol.c=\r\nom&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thursday, September 20, 2007 12:56:07=\r\n AM\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] Re: EVP Experiment planned in October.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n=\r\n\n    \n            --- \n\nThat could be a possibility for some, but not for m=\r\ne.
