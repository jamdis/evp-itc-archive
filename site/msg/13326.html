<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Greetings diazwoman,

The &quot;split cord to do both&quot; you asked about is a Y-Cable Adapter.  
Radio Shack has them.  The part number is 42-2496.  I use them all 
the time.  You can then plug in a recorder and speaker or ear buds at 
the same time.

Enjoy... and welcome!

&gt; Greetings all! I recently joined the group after becoming very 
interested in EVP and basically 
&gt; the whole idea of after death communication. Thus far I have only 
used a digital recorder to 
&gt; record at random times during trips to cemeteries etc. without 
success.Now I would like to 
&gt; try some more controlled efforts as far as set times, set questions 
and have purchased a 
&gt; hacked radioshack 12-469? 
&gt; 
&gt; My questions if anyone can help
&gt; 
&gt; my hacked radio has no external speaker only a place for earbuds, 
is there some kind of a 
&gt; cord or connecter I can get that will hook it to a external 
speaker? how about some kind of 
&gt; cord to hook it to a digital reorder..or a spit cord to do both?? I 
am very, very electroncially 
&gt; challenged so do these exists?? what are they called? and where can 
I buy them?
&gt; 
&gt; my next question has to do with attempting to record EVP , anything 
you have noted which 
&gt; seems to encourage success?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks in advance!
