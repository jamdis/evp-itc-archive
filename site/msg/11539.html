Hi All,

I am Andrea Carr who is a 41 year old wife and mom of 1 daughter. =
I am sorry I have not written before but I have a terrible year and haven't=
 had the time to concentrate on EVP like I had prior. I won't get into the =
details but it has left me in the midst of OK just trying to pull through a=
ll of this BS & I will get back to it when I can.

Unfortunatley I am leavi=
ng for the weekend tomorrow morning and won't see my e-mails until Monday m=
orning. 

I have a question for any one here. I believe in aliens, spirit a=
nd ghost communications via evp but tonight I had an experience I never had=
 before.

I woke up at exactly 2:22 by my stove's clock and went and cleane=
d my sink of dishes while I heated up some cream chipped beef (albiet not t=
oo exciting) but while I sat there after in the dark with my family sleepin=
g my hallway ilummating a light clored blue several times. Anyone else ever=
 seen this?

I look forward to any responses.

Thanks!
Andrea
