Thats intriguing Frank.=C2=A0 This sets up several other interesting opport=
unities:

1) Since the input source can be repeated, you can develop repeat=
able tests.=C2=A0 So if you have a 30 minute tape, you can arrange to ask a=
 set group of questions.=C2=A0 You can then repeat this test multiple times=
.=C2=A0 Theoretically, if the selections coming through are being influence=
d by the same entity, the results should be statistically similar over seve=
ral runs.=C2=A0 If there is no statistical similarity, that would suggest t=
he selections are random, and not being influenced by any entities.=C2=A0 T=
his would be a great addition to the test space for these technologies,

2)=
 Using this method, perhaps more testing and experiments can now be done in=
side a controlled environment,=C2=A0 like a Faraday cage.=C2=A0 This would =
allow the creation of controlled, repeatable tests, without going out into =
the sticks.

3) On the downside, this also sets up a potential for abuse, w=
herein a person could seed a tape with the names of people, dates, and othe=
r words thought to be relevant to a given the location of an evp session.=
=C2=A0 The more often these words occur on the tape, even using random sele=
ction, the more likely they will be played in response to questions.=C2=A0 =
Even a person who does not intend for this to happen, could still create so=
me stastical issues unless the tape is very carefully controlled to be rand=
om.

In fact, if you find that this tape approach seems to have utility, th=
e whole idea of selection from radio broadcasts could be replaced by using =
several standardized tapes, and a new focus of the evp community would be o=
n this standardization.
