&gt; New Box from Rob showed up today, the Speakjet #4. 
&gt; I was planning on 
&gt; taking the day off from this, but i got sucked right
&gt; back in again.  
&gt; The files are a bit rough sounding, i was moving
&gt; around a lot but got 
&gt; some good files.  I&#x27;m only 2 minutes into a 8 minute
&gt; session, but i 
&gt; need to eat and sleep.  I posted what i got so far,
&gt; i didn&#x27;t want to 
&gt; let Rob down by getting it and not posting files
&gt; from it the same day.  
&gt; That&#x27;s not my style, i appreciate him doing that for
&gt; me and hope to get 
&gt; much more from it as i experiment.  Remember
&gt; deadscience.com is where 
&gt; to go for more info on the speakjet boxes.
