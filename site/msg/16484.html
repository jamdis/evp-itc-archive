Thanks FrankR, yeah, I don't know why some people are so driven to support=
 their claims, and so against any rational thinking or testing of them.=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 Living up to some image they've obtained, fear, could all be reas=
ons I suppose, both for the blind debunker, and the blind believer.=C2=A0 B=
ut I also consider positive reasons, if I can all them that: the believer w=
ho wants a happier life, or to help others with their knowledge. And the sk=
eptic who wants to keep people from wasting their time or money, and so als=
o acquire a happier life.

I don't know Karen's "true" goal or plans, but a=
s I find out more, I will let you know.=C2=A0 And if there's opportunity to=
 keep the test honest or add as much good process to it as possible, I hope=
 everyone participates.

I li=

eir is evidence. Scientific method is used to determine what is most probab=
le because there are no tests where all variables can be accounted for and =
used. A good test uses many independent variables. Also, a hypothesis is de=
signed to be disproven, not proven as most people think.

This woman =

=C2=A0
In social psycho=

I don't think "Objective" means what you think it m=
eans.

But the point of the test it to find a method that will allow the ev=
idence to speak for itself, and that is not subject to, well, subjective in=
terpretation.=C2=A0 I'm sure if you were involved in the testing design, th=
at could be achieved, to keep the results from being biased, and to keep ev=
eryone 'honest, as you put it.

You also said below " If a person doesn't w=
ant to hear it, they won't".=C2=A0 Yes, this could be a problem with the te=
st, unless a good test is developed, to remove that subjectivity.=C2=A0 It =
also works the other way of course:=C2=A0=C2=A0 If a person wants to hear i=
t, they will, which is just as subjectively bad, and can confound the resea=
rcher with all kinds of nonsensical results, strange messages, failed predi=
ctions, and so on.=C2=A0 Testing can be a way to better determine how to te=
ll which methods and messages are the most valid and
 promising.

I certain=
ly understand that some beliefs are essentially religious faith: people sta=
te it is true, and don't want anyone to question it.=C2=A0 And I don't want=
 to question anyone's religion (they get really mad and insulting when you =
do).

Maybe some people feel that way about EVPs.=C2=A0 I feel that this te=
chnology is instead perfectly applicable to good testing.=C2=A0 There are m=
any theories and approaches to EVP and ITC, and I think testing is the best=
 way to determine which works the best, which equipment people should spend=
 their money on, which theories they should spend most time with.=C2=A0 I'm=
 not sure why anyone would not want to determine these kinds of things.

Bu=
t I am now in contact with the testers and with Karen, and will be happy to=
 keep everyone informed of how this all goes.=C2=A0
