That is the icing  \n&gt; on the cake.\n&gt;\n&gt; What would bother me terribly is if any of us researchers received  \n&gt; a message from a spirit in which we could actually make contact  \n&gt; with their loved one to send the tape, and then to try and charge  \n&gt; the contactee for the recording.\n&gt;\n&gt; In my opinion if any of us receive such a message with that  \n&gt; clarity, we should send/give it to the contactee free of charge as  \n&gt; doing so is in a sense a spiritual gift from the spirit to the  \n&gt; contactee, and we are just the messenger.  I have been researching  \n&gt; this concept, and I myself hope to one day be able to receive clear  \n&gt; and concise messages which would enable me to contact the spirit&#39;s  \n&gt; loved one to give them that message should they wish to receive it.  \n&gt; And I gurantee you it will be free of charge.\n&gt;\n&gt; Have any of you received on any occasion enough info from the  \n&gt; spirits to be able to contact the loved one and give them the  \n&gt; recording?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Early Cuyler &lt;ecuyler@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; How true it is.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: Steve Hultay &lt;urkel23@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, April 6, 2008 7:53:35 AM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: boxes on ebay\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeremy,\n&gt;\n&gt; There will always be a market for less educated people and some to\n&gt; take advantage of that.

I&#39;m just saying\n&gt; there are those who take advantage and should have no business in\n&gt; doing so. One example I can give is Chris Moon. He charges people\n&gt; to do box sessions. I can&#39;t remember the exact fee, but it&#39;s\n&gt; outrageous that he&#39;s doing this, not to mention, he does so with a\n&gt; Frank&#39;s box. He is a self proclaimed medium and I&#39;ve heard from many\n&gt; sources that he is nothing but a fake.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So I attribute my frustration with people of this type, but again I\n&gt; say, as long as there are people dumb enough to pay for this, then\n&gt; there will always be those who take advantage.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Personally, I feel anyone who is gifted with mediumship or other\n&gt; advanced intuitive abilities should use it as a gift to help others,\n&gt; not for monetary gain.. I&#39;m not being judgmental here, that&#39;s just\n&gt; how I feel. I have a friend who is also a legitimate medium and I\n&gt; don&#39;t agree that she should use her abilities for gain, but it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean I like her any less. My not liking it won&#39;t change the\n&gt; fact that it happens, it&#39;s just the way things go.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do I think that Ron is taking advantage of people? No I don&#39;t.\n&gt; Ron says he uses the best parts available and that the cost of the\n&gt; Minibox is very close to what it costs to manufacture it. How close,\n&gt; I have no idea. On the other hand, I don&#39;t own one as I think $399\n&gt; or $449 for the &quot;crystal enhanced version,&quot; is a lot to pay for a\n&gt; device that, from what I&#39;ve heard, produces the same results as a\n&gt; Radio Shack radio for $25-$40.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jeremy\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; &gt; From: itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@ ...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, April 5, 2008 1:32:28 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: boxes on ebay\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Jeremy. If everyone knew about these support\n&gt; boards and that other resources are\n&gt; &gt; available to them, that would be one thing. Obviously everyone\n&gt; here is aware of that. But\n&gt; &gt; not everyone knows this place exists.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And even if they do know about the boards here, how many would have\n&gt; the nerve to ask\n&gt; &gt; for help from strangers? As Bruce recently shared, he gives people\n&gt; invitations to contact\n&gt; &gt; him privately in case they are too shy just ask a question\n&gt; publicly. Which means, by the\n&gt; &gt; way, to some degree they have overcome some of that shyness in\n&gt; order to post whatever it\n&gt; &gt; was to begin with, which inspired him to make this offer. What if\n&gt; they don&#39;t even have the\n&gt; &gt; gumption to be anything more than be a look-i-loo?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m guessing many people are just surfing the net, checking out\n&gt; paranormal stuff, and run\n&gt; &gt; across the hacked boxes for sale.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Again, I ask people who are taking the position you and Bruce are\n&gt; regarding profits ... do\n&gt; &gt; you have this same harsh sentiment toward Ron Ricketts, who makes\n&gt; and sells the\n&gt; &gt; MiniBoxes? I realize he is passionate about this research and\n&gt; helping others. Does that\n&gt; &gt; give him amnesty for making a profit?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Personally I think we need to not be so judgmental. At what point\n&gt; does &quot;profitable gain in\n&gt; &gt; the paranormal field&quot; become &quot;sickening?&quot; I have a friend who is a\n&gt; medium. I mean THE\n&gt; &gt; REAL DEAL. He charges for his services. The fee is reasonable\n&gt; compared to many in his\n&gt; &gt; field. Does he do this because he&#39;s a terrible person looking to\n&gt; take advantage of people?\n&gt; &gt; NO, he does so because he has been given a gift that changes\n&gt; people&#39;s lives for the better.\n&gt; &gt; But he has to make a living.... has to support himself in some way.\n&gt; And because he has\n&gt; &gt; chosen to provide this service full time (and is not a trust fund\n&gt; baby), he makes a profit.\n&gt; &gt; This allows him to help far more people than he could if working\n&gt; some other kind of job\n&gt; &gt; and providing his services at no cost on the side.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I realize this is not exactly the same thing as gouging people on\n&gt; the price for a\n&gt; &gt; commercially available product, but making such blanket statements\n&gt; about profitability in\n&gt; &gt; the paranormal field being sickening is rather short-sighted, in my\n&gt; opinion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a southern friend who likes to say, &quot;It&#39;s a mighty thin\n&gt; plank that ain&#39;t got two sides.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; I just don&#39;t think we have the right to claim that simply because\n&gt; someone is offering a\n&gt; &gt; good and or service for profit to consumers in the paranormal\n&gt; market, that this\n&gt; &gt; automatically means they are taking advantage of other&#39;s\n&gt; vulnerabilities.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For Pete&#39;s sake, no one is twisting the people&#39;s arms to buy those\n&gt; units on eBay. They are\n&gt; &gt; perfectly free to buy from whatever source they choose. Since the\n&gt; units do work as\n&gt; &gt; claimed, we can argue that people have overpaid, shopped unwisely,\n&gt; or whatever. I assure\n&gt; &gt; you this happens every single day throughout the retail market\n&gt; place with all types of\n&gt; &gt; products and services.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I will say I have a fairly heathy dose of distain for\n&gt; charlatans/scam artists (of any flavor in\n&gt; &gt; any field) but that is not what we are talking about here. We are\n&gt; talking about people who\n&gt; &gt; are offering legitimate products to consumers. I&#39;d rather see\n&gt; people doing this for profit,\n&gt; &gt; even when obscene, than running scams that damage people&#39;s\n&gt; physical, mental, and/or\n&gt; &gt; financial well-being.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Early Cuyler &lt;ecuyler@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Very well put, Bruce. Profitable gain in the paranormal field is\n&gt; sickening.. Unfortunately,\n&gt; &gt; there are those who continue to support the ones profiting, so it\n&gt; will continue. It makes\n&gt; &gt; me sick that people take advantage of others vulnerabilities,\n&gt; especially when it comes to\n&gt; &gt; spiritual matters, but that&#39;s a rant for another time and place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If someone is afraid to try hacking a radio or lacks the proper\n&gt; tools, they are more than\n&gt; &gt; welcome to send them to me and I&#39;ll do it for them and ship it\n&gt; back.
