<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello,

I don&#x27;t know what to do, is the second time that a spirit gets in my 
cell, just to insult me, then &quot;she&quot; gets away, then others come to 
bring wonderful messages, are some spirits envious of us ? I think its 
the same spirit that have insulted me, its a woman, don&#x27;t know who she 
was or is, but she had handled to get in to insult me. Do I have to 
tell her to go away and leave me alone ? or do I have to insult her 
back ?

any ideas ?

Thanks
Neli</pre>
