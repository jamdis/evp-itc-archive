<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I took the radio apart to take some pictures to show the hack and i&#x27;m 
not really sure why some had problems.  I think maybe some may have 
messed with the bottom board.  You only need to access the top board 
with the LCD display and there is nothing that will fall off except the 
2 buttoms that control the light and SW band selector, both can easily 
be put on after the hack in a matter of seconds.  I posted some 
pictures and a detailed description on my site, so you can see the 
procedure.  It took 5 minutes the first time, but after looking at it 
again it could probably be done faster but take your time with it.

The details are at www.keyportparanormal.com and look for the folder on 
the left that says &quot;Simple Ghost Box Hack&quot;

Hope this helps.
