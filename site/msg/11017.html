Mick,
   
  Yes, many pf us have had evps or communications that tell us nasty things... I have a guy named Dave who we at this group refer to as "potty mouth'and  many others have been called bad names too...... Im sure they will tell you in thier own words tho- but this is not uncommon...
  I actually read a study once, where they said on average, 12% of evp communications are mean, or threatening in nature. ( i do not know the validity of this study tho)

possible? Has anyone encountered language like this with their evp's?

Thanks,

Mick,
