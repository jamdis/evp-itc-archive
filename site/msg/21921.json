I explained that I wasn&#39;t trying to steal his\nmembers.\nI asked them (and him) if they would like to join on an investigation, not\njoin the group and I told him that this 16 year old doesn&#39;t exist.\nHe replied apologizing. He agreed he forgot to have me sign the forms.  He\ntalked to the girls mother again and found that she&#39;s changed her story a\nfew times. I&#39;m just glad it&#39;s not going to be an ongoing drama.\n\nOn Thu, Aug 18, 2011 at 9:32 AM, Vicky Cox &lt;vickyw222@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I have a legal question that I cannot seem to find an answer to. I recently\n&gt; went on an investigation to a public place with a  paranormal group. While\n&gt; my experience is much less than theirs, I found them to be too disorganized.\n&gt; Three people came from the group. One had no equipment and the second used\n&gt; his cell phone. I never even saw a pencil. So, I started a small group,\n&gt; specifically for amateur investigators staying in local public places so we\n&gt; don&#39;t get in over our heads. We aren&#39;t trying to get any resident\n&gt; investigations and are non competitive. On our site I put photos and evps I\n&gt; had gotten while on the investigation and put at the bottom that some\n&gt; evidence was obtained while on investigations with other groups. I didn&#39;t\n&gt; use any of their names. As with any of my photos, I blocked out any faces,\n&gt; and it was all on my equipment. I signed nothing and agreed to nothing.\n&gt; Yesterday he sent me an email saying he wants it taken down. It&#39;s\n&gt; technically and legally his ( technically and legally?). If I wanted to\n&gt; start my own group all I had to do was ask. He has said that I invited a 16\n&gt; year old to join the group (Definitely didn&#39;t). And that he thought I would\n&gt; join their group.\n&gt; -I don&#39;t believe he&#39;s right on the legal issue. Ethically, I would have\n&gt; accredited the group if he was more diplomatic and maybe even taken it down.\n&gt;\n&gt; - wouldn&#39;t making false accusations make him guilty of liable?\n&gt; - I don&#39;t need to ask him to do ****. I&#39;ve met him twice.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anybody know of any place where I can find something written on the\n&gt; law about those photos and media being mine.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Vicky\n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nVicky\n\nI w o e him back wi h his o iginal message a ached and copied i o he membe s o his g oup ha claimed I was ying o s eal hem.
