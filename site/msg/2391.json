I \ntook the box back to the work bench, and it works fine!  Our dingbat \ndaughter in-law gave us a &#39;rescue&#39; poodle a couple weeks ago, which \nwas fine, and a cute little dog. Last ngith she fell off the bed and \nbroke leg! The segment talks about that, from #24. I left it long \ncuz there&#39;s some other voices in it, like Bob Houston, a guide I \nthink as he frequently comes through. It&#39;s interesting to doa google \non &#39;Bob Houston&#39;.
