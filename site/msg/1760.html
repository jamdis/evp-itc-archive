<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thats very interesting the second one takes a few listens to 
understand it but its very interesting indeed. Great capture. Im 
going to create a folder here sometime in the next week, as I capture 
more. I didnt want to put old captures up. Anyway great work. Keep 
them coming, I love listening to others&#x27; results. Regards,
                                                      T.L.

&gt; hey guy&#x27;s
&gt; I did another fm sweep this morning and was going over it and got 
this 
&gt; really long message. pertaining to a spirit that I captured an evp 
from 
&gt; on a cemetery investigation in Staten island NY, it mentions the 
spirit 
&gt; by name and it&#x27;s funny because it was the voice of a little girl 
and I 
&gt; said a prayer for her spirit guide to find her and help her cross 
over. 
&gt; This was about a month and a half ago. and today I get this message 
on 
&gt; the FM sweep recording. I have posted only the two messages in the 
file 
&gt; section under bhali sweep and sound file folder. they are the only 
two 
&gt; files in there I deleted the rest so as not to use up to much space.
&gt; The first is it&#x27;s me Mandy and the second is named long file and I 
&gt; believe it says &quot;awaiting something_ a man named Saul _he&#x27;ll be 
asking 
&gt; for Mandy_ he&#x27;s from our side_ he&#x27;s a rabbi&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; please let me know what you think. There are quite a few more and 
I&#x27;m 
&gt; only part way through the recording.
