<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>FS: Oh, boy...I&#x27;ll stick with &quot;no fear.&quot;  :)

The following is not directed at anyone:

We could say this very same thing about anything that becomes 
obsessive, thus blaming it on negative entities.  Ex: I recently 
heard about a 40 year old man becoming so obsessive with playing a 
video game that he lost his job, his wife and kids, and had to move 
in with his parents!  Was it the devil?  No, he was just a dumb-ss!  

I would rather suggest it possible that focusing all of one&#x27;s time 
and attention to this (or anything) will bring negative behavior of 
some sort...hell, watching too much TV, or living on the computer is 
not healthy, I would suspect.

If people want protection, they should first seek having a healthy 
perspective on life in general, and attempt to have a balanced 
lifestyle.  I for one think that would solve most all issues for many 
of us.  

I therefore wonder if the &quot;demons&quot; people fear are really creations 
from our own selfish, mis-thinking, obsessive-compulsive lifestyles - 
all self-created for personal gain and self-satisfaction.  ;)

&gt;  Hi All; We have been warned by others from time to time about 
unbridled box use, as it supposedly brings in negativity. I don&#x27;t 
want to believe that, but there are a few cases of people using boxes 
made by me, as well as the hack radios, and going whacko big time. 
Its&#x27; either all ego--I&#x27;m the onlyest one that can use this, or like 
the more recent example. I don&#x27;t know if these people were like this 
to start, or if it&#x27;s an external influance, but it&#x27;s discouraging. 
There seems to be a similar reaction with systems not made by me--so 
I&#x27;ve been told.
&gt;  
&gt;  Soooo, maybe burn some white candles, and maybe get a Rosary. My 
guys talk about the Catholics, and the Purple Princess has a Catholic 
connection on the etheric levels, although the church imposes too 
many limits on her. I wouldn&#x27;t want to go into a state of fear, but a 
little protection stuff couldn&#x27;t hurt. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Not only do I not have the time to mass produce boxes, I&#x27;m 
beginning to think it&#x27;s not a good idea anyway.
