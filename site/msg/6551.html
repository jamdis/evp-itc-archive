No offense taken. He just meant that sometimes in some programs conversion is too intense and bits of audio are changed a bit. I finally found one that didnt hurt them during the adjustment. They usually sound exactly the same. But programs like audacity etc when I save them as mp3 sometimes the audio doesnt quite sound like the original, certain syllables sound muffled, or volume is lost, or just different. When that happens I save it as a wav and use the other program to convert it if needed.
   
  When you save it you still hear it the same on playback then youve lost nothing in the transfer.

Yeah, i didn't mean to offend anyone with the suggestion of using 
Mp3's. I record in Mp3 format, so no conversion is necessary for 
me. So, i'm not familiar with the loss of audio content in the 
conversion process from wav to mp3's. If you record in mp3 format to 
start with is it still losing audio? I'm really not sure how it 
works with wav files and mp3's other than the space is a lot more. I 
think most recorders have an option with what file type to record 
with, i'm going to do a recording later and see if i hear the 
difference between the wav and mp3 for personal knowledge. I may 
have been missing audio all along.

Thanx,
