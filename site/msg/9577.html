Honey as soon as you turn audition on, it should have asked   you.  If not try going into your file section and you should be able to   recover it as the last session and/or file done.

Audition can recover an unsaved session in case the       program (or
computer) should crash.

But perhaps it was intention       that the session was not saved - who
knows... paranormal phenomena are       often elusive by their nature.
