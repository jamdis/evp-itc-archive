<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think 10 seconds is about right, IMHO, but any shorter and you&#x27;ll 
find yourself speaking over replies sometimes (even at 10 seconds).  

Formerly being a stickler against editing, I now do edit some.  For 
example, if I have a 5 second clip and there are some scrub noises 
between words that interfere with the message, I now cut it from the 
clip.  This makes it easier for first timers to be able to identify 
and comprehend the &quot;manipulation&quot; and how it sounds...allowing them 
to hear what to listen for in responses.

If you are going to cut/edit, just keep the raw audio as 
backup...proof for those who question, if you will.

&gt; &gt; I agree with you totally, Juli.  I admit that I used to give 
&gt; upwards of 25 seconds between questions.  I&#x27;ve learned that if I&#x27;m 
&gt; going to get an answer, it usually comes a lot sooner than that, if 
&gt; not, then I&#x27;m not getting an answer at that time.  But that had to 
&gt; come with learning.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For those of you who are paranormal investigators alike, you know 
&gt; the first rule of thumb is NEVER edit your clips!  If you want to 
be 
&gt; taken serious in this field and not under a microscope with the 
&gt; question of whether or not you in fact did actually get a voice 
&gt; and/or response and that clip is edited, don&#x27;t bother putting it up 
&gt; for public display.  You can amplify it, take out the hiss, but you 
&gt; better not splice it in any way, cause your just asking for 
trouble.  
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; I had this very debate with Bruce long ago.  I know first hand 
that 
&gt; if in fact its edited many question your motives behind why you in 
&gt; fact would bother removing the dead airtime between.  The very 
first 
&gt; thing that came into question when editing EVP from Frank&#x27;s Box 
many 
&gt; moons ago (pun intended) that a certain person was in fact splicing 
&gt; his audio by putting the questions and response right after.  Many 
&gt; now consider him to be a fraud and this was just one of the reason 
&gt; built upon others as a direct result.  You are altering the clip, 
no 
&gt; ifs and or butts about.  It can therefore hurt your creditability 
as 
&gt; a researcher in the paranormal field.  Regardless with you save 
your 
&gt; original clips.  Everything you do comes into question.  You can 
&gt; clearly tell by the skip in rhythm as you play the audio vs the 
free 
&gt; flowing of the dial when it has been altered.  Real Time is real 
time 
&gt; people, not 15 seconds after the fact.  If you have to questions 
what 
&gt; you
&gt; &gt;  got....&quot;If in Doubt, throw It Out&quot;.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; People, there is one thing that you have to remember.  The word 
of 
&gt; box research is spreading, and there are those who are implementing 
&gt; it as an additional tool on investigations.  This is not just some 
&gt; who are going to give up their current status as a ghost hunter to 
&gt; now slowly be a box researcher ( for that was never a thought for 
&gt; me).  I was hoping that through my research I could in fact 
&gt; incorporate it on my investigations.  Because of the radio 
fragments 
&gt; itself, there are many that do not support this research and 
believe 
&gt; we are reaching and grasping at nothing, and literally laugh when 
the 
&gt; subject of box research comes up.  Do you really want to give them 
an 
&gt; extra ammunition as splicing your clips?  I know myself that there 
is 
&gt; more that meets the eye in this line for communication, and I do 
&gt; stand proud and true of pursuing real time communication, myself, 
but 
&gt; cutting out the dead air is not just because you don&#x27;t want to 
listen 
&gt; to it, or you can&#x27;t
&gt; &gt;  fit it all is a lame excuse.  Use a different program!
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; I personally have questioned many on their clips and have to tell 
&gt; you that if you truly want to be considered as a professional 
&gt; paranormal investigator/ researcher that if you intend to use this 
&gt; protocol for you evp/box research clips, you stand to loose your 
&gt; creditability and the word fraud may just come into question.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; However, if you have nothing to loose as far as your reputation 
and 
&gt; or not in it to prove anything to anyone, be my guest.  There are 
&gt; many here that are not involved in the paranormal field and a 
prefer 
&gt; evp-itc researcher vs. other areas of the super natural.  If they 
are 
&gt; not putting themselves out there for God and Country to see, and 
are 
&gt; only doing it for your personal results and curiosity, and can 
could 
&gt; careless with others thing, then clip away to your hearts content!  
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Just remember, if someone who is currently studying evp and not 
box 
&gt; research sees and hears your clips, don&#x27;t be surprised, if they 
start 
&gt; questioning your motives and box research all together!
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Just adding my 2 cents!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I do remove the &quot;garbage&quot; from my files.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; At this point in my research, the message is more important to 
me 
&gt; &gt; than the proof of it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think most of us here will agree that we are receiving some 
&gt; sort 
&gt; &gt; of paranormal communication.
&gt; &gt; &gt; but it definitely exists. now we need to concentrate on the 
&gt; &gt; messages they need us to hear and the answers to the questions
&gt; &gt; &gt; we ask and in turn our answers to their questions. Anyone that 
&gt; &gt; cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the 
file
&gt; &gt; &gt; that has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously 
&gt; &gt; garbage like the &quot;EH O EH AH O EH UR&quot; in between words.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; For example &quot;Is there anyone here that wishes to 
&gt; &gt; communicate_ YES_AH ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return 
to 
&gt; a 
&gt; &gt; file that I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold 
some
&gt; &gt; &gt; relivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly 
&gt; &gt; listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; At this stage in real time communication the messages are the 
top 
&gt; &gt; priority.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I do however agree that the untouched version should be 
retained 
&gt; &gt; and made available to individuals that make a request 
&gt; &gt; &gt; for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that 
may 
&gt; &gt; be made, and god knows there are always fanatical 
&gt; &gt; &gt; sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to 
attack 
&gt; &gt; an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; our research files should be made available on request by every 
&gt; &gt; tom dick and harry that is unknown to us and may potentially
&gt; &gt; &gt; doctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the 
&gt; &gt; researcher that receives the request for raw research data should 
&gt; &gt; &gt; scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment 
&gt; &gt; before handing out any research data.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, 
I 
&gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a 
&gt; whole, 
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You 
can 
&gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip 
&gt; &gt; (including
&gt; &gt; &gt; the experimenter&#x27; s voice), filter or denoise it to make it 
&gt; &gt; clearer, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an 
EVP 
&gt; &gt; match
&gt; &gt; &gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should 
&gt; &gt; always
&gt; &gt; &gt; be provided along with the edited version.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; But that&#x27;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to 
&gt; &gt; express, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical 
&gt; &gt; public.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Stefan
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; -- 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these 
&gt; &gt; files.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow 
that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the 
&gt; &gt; message 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise 
&gt; &gt; that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#x27;t belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can&#x27;t piece 
&gt; &gt; these 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; files together to make something it&#x27;s not, so i keep them in 
&gt; &gt; true 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; form pretty much to the original.
