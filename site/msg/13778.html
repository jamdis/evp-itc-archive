Hi John,

I do appreciate what you are saying here. But I think it would be=
 far easier to come at it from a different direction-via testing the info r=
eceived for validity of spirit communication. At this point, it does not ma=
tter If I know what "spirit communicators" are, or if there is even a diffe=
rence between entities I can talk to through the board, and your common gho=
st.

If I am the only one using the board, and I have only one other person=
 present to serve as witness, and I receive verifiable info consistently, i=
nfo that either of us have no prior knowledge of, I could be reasonably cer=
tain that we are not the one's responsible, at least on a conscious level.
=

To test further for "psychic" influence from one of us, if we would verify=
 that the info that came from the supposed spirit, such as its name, birthd=
ate, death date, other details, has no connection to either of us (such as =
a dead relative). At that point, we can be reasonably certain the info is c=
oming from an external source, and not a living being.

With all due respec=
t, I think there are just too many unknown, unproven,  and uncontrollable f=
actors doing it employing the methods you have proposed. We need to "K.I.S.=
S." (Keep It Simple Stupid), as much as humanly possible.

But again, I do =
appreciate the info, as it helps to look at the equation from all angles.

 An alternative to the usual ghost hunter stuff.






  This is an interes=
ting topic thread. I have a few suggestions that might be of interest.



 =
 First let's think about what it is you propose. You want to know if moveme=
nt on a Ouija board is evidence of spirit communication or something else, =
presumably your own abilities. In order to determine if a spirit is involve=
d, you will need a test for a spirit communicator. This implies you know wh=
at spirit communicators do. And therein lies the problem. We don't know thi=
s unfortunately.  Now, we might frame the question differently: can we demo=
nstrate if the acitivity is likely the result of motor response and if so h=
ow? This won't make it possible to say that the results come from spirits, =
but it might be possible at least to rule out most known methods that are a=
ttributable to living persons, which would be a start.



  We'll begin by =
putting aside mechanical explanations. To do this we need to be sure ideomo=
tor response cannot be a possibility. Since ideomotor requires opposing for=
ces in order to work, this means only one operator with a single finger of =
one hand on the planchette. 

  What we would really like to see is planche=
tte motion with no contact. This would remove any normal physical explanati=
on of the planchette movement. Now we are down to one of two possibilities =
aside from kinetic energy, which can be disestablished by simply waiting. 
=



  First, the planchette is being moved by some unknown psychic force by =
an individual present in the room, perhaps the operator. Second, the planch=
ette is being moved by some unseen thing (which could include a "spirit") t=
hat may or may not be using a person in the room or elsewhere as an interme=
diary. We seek to establish which of these two is more probable. We do that=
 by seeing if there is any indication that a physical person in the room is=
 producing anything unexpected.



  Here is where things become a bit dice=
y and for some, problematic. There has been reputable research in the field=
 of Parapscyhology that indicates that there are focal people who participa=
te in psychokinesis (PK), the apparent heart of what is called 'poltergeist=
' activity. There is every reason to believe that, if any anomalous planche=
tte movement is occuring, that it too is most likely caused by PK. These fo=
cal people have several characteristics, one of which is a history of psych=
ophysiological disorders. Unfortunately not everyone who has these disorder=
s is aware of it. Many also have a belief system that in some way allows th=
em to experience PK activity. Lastly they appear most often to be successfu=
l in environments where strong magnetic fields exist.



  This would sugge=
st that the best way to detect a potentil living PK agent as the cause of t=
his activity would be to monitor two types of magnetic fields. In the envir=
onment it would make sense to test for strong geomagnetic fields with porta=
ble geomagnetometers. These are not inexpensive; the type required cost abo=
ut $800 U.S. You can monitor body fields reasonably well using a Trifield N=
atural EM meter. Psychophysiologists have used these relatively inexpensive=
 meters to find high biofields in humans, often those who appear to be PK f=
ocal people. The key is that a DC meter must be used. Levels have been obse=
rved in the 1 to 3 Gauss range. Yes, if you know much about human physiolog=
y you will know that should be impossible. The physiologists who have relia=
bly made these measurements are as stumped as anyone as to why they would b=
e that high and cannot explain them either. They simply know that these are=
 replicable and stable readings over decades of measurements.



  If you f=
ind this type of environment and you find a moving planchette with no one p=
resent touching it, you can infer at least beyond a wild guess, that there =
may be some evidence for participation by a local individual as opposed to =
an external entity. You cannot say with complete certainty that no external=
 entity is involved, but you can say there is a strong indication that some=
one locally is probably involved and likely responsible. To test this, remo=
ve individuals from the area and see if the activity stops. Clearly this sh=
ould be replicated if possible. While replication provides more certainty o=
f the assumption it will never provide 100% proof, unfortunately.



  I ho=
pe readers find this information useful. I monitor the digests occasionally=
 and will try to answer any inquiries you may have here.
