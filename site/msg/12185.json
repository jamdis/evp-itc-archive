I was just speaking with  \n&gt; another researcher, and there are a few in the EVP/ITC research field  \n&gt; who insist on what I refer to as &quot;egotizing&quot; spirits. It&#39;s remarkably  \n&gt; important to these individuals, usually of a certain gender (reason  \n&gt; unknown to me), to demonize spirits and insist on there being intense  \n&gt; evil spirits and holding onto the idea of fear. Perhaps the excitement  \n&gt; and adrenaline or are they  simply a host to their egos? I don&#39;t know.\n&gt; \n&gt; This isn&#39;t a judgment, but something I, and others, have observed over  \n&gt; the years. I&#39;m not saying this is you Andy as of course, I don&#39;t know  \n&gt; you. But it&#39;s an interesting phenomenon. I have to wonder if it isn&#39;t  \n&gt; due to religious ideas conceived by these same types of fear mongering  \n&gt; individuals who came up with the ideas of a &quot;hell&quot; and a vengeful mean  \n&gt; God, etc... which don&#39;t exist in my mind. All interesting to ponder!\n&gt; \n&gt; It never occurred to me to be afraid. The idea never entered my mind  \n&gt; until you now mention it, and I guess it&#39;s a matter of perception. You  \n&gt; could choose to see me as being a host to light bearing elementals,  \n&gt; devas, and angels or a slave to controlling self serving beings. It&#39;s  \n&gt; all your choice!\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess the real test of my being a host (as I like to perceive it  \n&gt; that way) to the elementals, will be next year! lol! Bonzai are like  \n&gt; babies... so much attention.\n&gt; \n&gt; w\n&gt; ‡•ê\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sep 18, 2008, at 10:17 AM, ourobouros2k2 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Very cool, but on this flip side, very frightening.
