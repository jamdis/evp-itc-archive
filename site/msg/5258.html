I had same problem when I tried to click on some of the files you uploaded last night. Says files not there yet I see it is there. The ones you attach to email posts I didnt have that problem with they play fine. Not sure what the deal is but maybe its filename being changed during upload by yahoo or something silly.

get some other software to play these.
