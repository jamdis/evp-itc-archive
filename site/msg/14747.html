<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, there&#x27;s something to be said for it, especially when fooling around
with things like this. I&#x27;m an RF/microwave engineer and a ham radio operator
as well. Been a licensed ham for 42 years now.

&gt; I am a ham radio operator and I remember one receiver that I had that was a
&gt; &quot;black box&quot; and completely software controlled. It was a Ten-Tec RX-320
&gt; receiver, and it received LW/MW/SW in AM/CW/SSB. It was a fun little radio,
&gt; but using the software to control it, there were so many other options
&gt; available. Nice bandscope with point-and-click tuning. Selectable user
&gt; defined filters, you name it. Another neat feature was the fact there there
&gt; were virtually dozens of third-party software releases for operating it,
&gt; usually catering to the ham/swl crowd.
&gt;
&gt; My thoughts are that perhaps a similar computer-controlled ghost box could
&gt; be made. You could use the software to define sweep style, and it would be
&gt; endless possibilities. You could have an RNG controlling the random sweep,
&gt; and linear sweeps could be programmed to emulate triangle, sawtooth, ramp,
&gt; etc...
&gt;
&gt; In addition, you could have on-the-fly recording options, and you could
&gt; apply various filters to clean it up. Visual waveform indicators, and file
&gt; reverse option for reversing the file. Heck, you could even introduce your
&gt; preference of noise source (white, pink, brown) into the signal. Perhaps an
&gt; optional echo chamber with built in mic for output. All of these things
&gt; could be software controlled, and I am not to sure they couldn&#x27;t be
&gt; implemented via software package for existing radios out there such as the
&gt; ICOM PCR-1000 or the TEN-TEC Rx 320 or Pegasus. Really all of these things
&gt; are a result of the software interface, so it is completely possible, but it
&gt; would have to be someone with a lot more tech experience than me to make it
&gt; a reality. Any takers?
&gt;
&gt; thanks
