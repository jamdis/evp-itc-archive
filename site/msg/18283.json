Like giggling like school girls while attacking a person that neither of them know.  And, my favorite in the show:\n\nDr Rorke calling me a douce bag at around 20 minutes in.  This is who is representing the field of scientific research.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  That&#39;s the rub, a cure for cancer would put many thousands out of\n&gt; work--there will be no cure, too much $$$ in research and toxic treatments\n&gt; that kill more than the desease. Science in this county is a joke! You can\n&gt; fund a study to verify whatever results you are willing to pay for.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-s\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, Jul 25, 2010 at 8:37 PM, &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Been thinking and decided that we are not wrong in our beliefs.

I&#39;m talking about a $30 radio that may help and\n&gt; &gt; has.  Seems like we have the upper hand in the matter.
