Sounds good.=A0 Count me in on the test.=A0 By the way, some here might be =

Reading the posts from the last week as I do every sat =
morning it is my 
opinion that some of them have a very polite condescendin=

them.This group and the people in it have always been very helpf=

a joy to do research with I hope it stays that way I would hate to =
see 
it become one of "those" boards if you know what I mean (my 1 cent had=
 
to do it). so anyway
One productive idea that I saw from one of this week=
s posts was to send 
the same file privitly to a few people and see what th=
ey hear in it. 
Unpromtide by file names or other posts about it. I have a =
couple files 
that I feel are pretty clear. So if you would like to volunte=
er just 
send me an email with your email adress and I will send you a file=
 not 
too long but it will be unedited and in its original form.
I will not=
 amplify it or edit or change it in anyway from its original. 
Those who re=
cive the files do the same NO editing untill you render 
your opinion to me=
 about it after that you can do what u like with it.
Remember after listeni=
ng email me DO NOT post what you hear on the 
board I will do that later wh=
en I have everyones opinion.
