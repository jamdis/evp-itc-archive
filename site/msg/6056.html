<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>After a good nights sleep and quite a few e-mails, I have decided to 
stick with the group on a limited basis so that I can offer advice 
from my experience to new people coming into the research.

I apologise for using this forum for my personal feelings but do not 
apologise for my reaction, I think it was an appropriate response to 
being called a fraud and a fake and lier.

Be that as it may, water under the bridge please forgive my inherent 
defense mechanism.

I will be here to help in any way I can and strive to ignore negative 
influence where ever it may come from.

I was also urged by mike and Lisa in a very definitive session today 
to return for the sake of harmony and good will. So I will try to 
live up to their ideal.

thanks for putting up with my outbursts.

Bruce</pre>
