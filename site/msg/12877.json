In the video demo at about 4:31 into the video it sounds like &quot;look Mike hello&quot; said twice. And it sounded like something about light in there too but wasnt clear enough for me to be sure.\n\nA couple others here were using diodes to record with instead of microphones but theres sounded alot different. Not sure how they set those up. You know me I always go for the easy to do stuff hehehe but I believe Frank Ratka tried using diodes and hmm maybe retro Dave did once? You&#39;d have to ask them. \n\nMisty\n\n\n--- On Fri, 11/21/08, M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Another prototype diode device for EVP capture\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, November 21, 2008, 5:36 PM\n&gt; Greetings fellow researchers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Well... I&#39;ve completed another prototype diode device\n&gt; for EVP capture.  \n&gt; This one I put in a clear case so you can see the circuit. \n&gt; It is \n&gt; similar to the first one I designed (Device #1) and built,\n&gt; except this \n&gt; one (Device #2) uses a slightly different coil with ferrite\n&gt; core and \n&gt; different diodes. Their breakdown voltage is less than the\n&gt; first I used.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can see pictures of it here:\n&gt; http://www.ufogeek.com/mikes_diode_evp_device.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s on the webpage, below Device #1.\n&gt; \n&gt; The audio from my first test is here:\n&gt; http://www.ufogeek.com/sessions/diodeplasma2.WMA\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; - Mike C.
