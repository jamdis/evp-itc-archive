OK, I believe it to be correct too.  Ron L

This is , I guess you could call it a theory but I think we throw 
that word around without it really applying to what we are saying or 
the subject matter.

So here are my thoughts on the subject of quality of communication. 
This is basically for the new researchers that have not had a chance 
to experience my long boring posts on my ideas of why what is what. I 
believe that the communication that is sent from the spirit world to 
us,
whether it be one word or a ten word sentence. Is always given the 
same amount of effort on the part of the sender or tech/guide that 
sends it.

When I say the same amount of effort I do not mean that they will 
use the same amount of communicative properties no matter how complex 
the message or what the conditions are at the moment they send it. 
What I mean is I believe that our friends always give 110% effort in 
any attempt at communication.

Let me explain why I felt it necessary to write this post on this 
subject. I received a response to the files I posted yesterday by 
Robin Searcy Henson and in the response she said and I quote

"Either your recordings are getting better by the moment or my 
hearing is improving"

Well it happens to be a little of both but not necessarily at the 
same time.
Let me explain, the first part of the statement was correct in that 
the recordings or messages if you will, where getting better by the 
moment.

"The Moment" being the key in that part of the statement. See it is 
my belief that it has nothing to do with the effort our spirit 
friends are exerting to send us the messages but the quality of 
conditions that are being produced at the particular "Moment" the 
communication is being sent.

The conditions concerning the reception of spirit messages are very 
diverse and need to be in a certain synchronization with each other 
to be affective in the sending and receiving of messages.

All conditions such as strength of radio signal, strength of our 
box reception, weather conditions even possibly astronomical 
conditions play a part in the successful sending and receiving of an 
individual message at any given "Moment" these factors are ever 
changing from millisecond to millisecond. Can you imagine the effort 
exerted by our spirit colleagues to catch the right sequence of 
conditions to be able to send even the most rudimentary of words such 
as a "yes" or "no".

It must be like trying to write your name on a bullet as it flies 
past you after being shot from a gun. I think that takes a very 
strong effort on the part of our spirit communicators.

On to the later part of robin's statement, "Or my hearing is 
improving" I don't think Robin realised how important a statement 
that was. It is my belief that the individual box researcher has to 
develop for lack of a better word an ear for listening to live and or 
box communication. I do not believe it is just a matter of anyone 
turning on a box and immediately being able to discern the 
communication coming from the box. For the simple reason, we where 
not trained from birth to listen to the type of sound or voice that 
emanates from an EVP box.

Even before we are born, in the womb we begin to hear the muffled 
sound of our mothers voice and to hear ambient sound that is being 
distributed in the immediate vicinity of our mothers body.
This is set up by years of evolution so that when we are born we can 
recognise the specific tone of our mothers voice and are imprinted to 
her so if we are ever reported as young we can utilise this effect to 
insure that the mother we go with is our own.

It was an instinct we developed in a time gone by when we did not 
have a nurse in a hospital to send us home with the correct parent 
and today we enjoy the luxury of not having to be separated from our 
mothers for a long time after our birth.
My point being is that our audio sensory perception develops over any 
given period of time when listening to a constant type of sound to 
more and more easily recognise that sound without having to have it 
explained to us.

Take for instance a guitar player, after a certain period of time 
playing the instrument he learns instinctively what each note should 
ideally sound like and is able to tune his guitar and every guitar 
player will tell you that each guitar plays the same basic notes but 
also has it's own unique sound.

Such is true for our instruments only they happen to be EVP boxes.
But like musical instruments some of them must be tuned and the user 
or researcher must develop an ear to listen for the right type of 
communication and become used to picking it out of the rest of the 
noise and chatter associated with a box signal and identify it as 
spirit communication. 

That is why if you have ever taken a box to the field or done a 
demonstration with someone that has never heard the box work or had a 
prolonged exposure to the box they will ultimately say that they 
heard a yes or no but for the most part did not hear anything but 
noise when as the session is in play the researcher is repeating 
words, names and phrases. that the uneducated person simply is not 
capable of hearing therefore they walk away from the experience 
thinking that the researcher is delirious or should be seeking 
professional help.

In any event these two subjects I felt needed to try and be 
explained so that new researchers understand why these circumstances 
may affect the quality of a box file or the way an individual is 
hearing it.

Again this all is a theory of mi8ne and of course I believe it to 
be correct, but please any researchers new or experienced form your 
own opinions the way I have formed this one through research, 
experimentation and experience.

Thanks
Bruce Halliday
