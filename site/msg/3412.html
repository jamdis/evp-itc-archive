Yeah I get names of people in the field too usually before I know them or about them. I also get some of you guys names now and then which I post or send via emails. I found thier interest in Frank S years ago and its never wavered. We connected a long time ago and it was never about the box. Tho it does make for interesting conversation!
   
  It's also nice to watch how you've grown Bruce ..not quite the same guy I first met  I enjoy the dedication that surrounds us at the moment. 
   
  Nice to see you all working together in a positive fashion. MORE GETS DONE THAT WAY!!!
   
  hehehe
   
  Keep up the good work everyone!

          Misty,
 
Thanks for taking the time to post those files. I seem to get a few names of persons that are doing box research
But I mostly get my name Steve's name and especially Frank sumptions name. I believe it is to let us know it is not radio fragment
and also to perk up our listening.

        Hiya Buce
   
  I hear almost all of those as labled. The help me file I hear different I hear "that you bruce?" 
   
  Mike had some good results on that one too. I heard your name mentioned on his video twice as well as his name. I clipped those out for you guys and posted to a previous email post. But I will restick them to this email for you. 
   
  Sorry I didnt clip it all for yall  just wanted to show him where I heard your names so he could maybe hear it too, which he does. 
   
  Thats one thing I like about any method I use they are always very direct with thier approach and use my name or others to get the point across better.

      HEY GUY'S 

OF COURSE I HAVE MY RS HACK AND GETTING RESULTS THE FIRST DAY.
MY INITIAL OPINION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS LITTLE GEM IS FROM TWO 
EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS ONE PERFORMED BY STEVE HULTAY AND MYSELF AND 
THE OTHER BY MYSELF ALONE. THE FILES I HAVE POSTED ARE GLEENED FROM 
ONLY THE FIRST MINUTE OR SO OF A TEN MINUTE RECORDING.PLEASE TAKE A 
MINUTE TO LISTEN AND POST YOUR FEEDBACK.

THE FILES ARE POSTED IN THE FILE SECTION UNDER: 

11-26-07_radio shack hack files_Bruce 

AFTER DOING ONLY ONE RECORDED SESSION AND TWO SESSIONS TOTAL. I AS A 
SERIOUS BOX RESEARCHER WITH EVRYDAY EXPERIMENTING ON FRANK'S,JOE'S 
AND NOW THE RADIO SHACK HACK BOX CAN PREMATURELY SAY THAT THIS RADIO 
MAY BE SMALL IN SIZE BUT IT PACKS A BIG PUNCH ! AND IT WAS UNDER OUR 
VERY NOSES ALL THE TIME. THANKS TO SUM DUC FOR HIS INSIGHT IN 
DISCOVERING IT.

AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING REDUNDENT I MUST REITERATE THIS RS BOX WILL 
HOLD IT'S OWN WITH THE BIG BOYS. THE RESULTS AND LEVEL OF 
COMMUNICATION BOTH IN REAL TIME DURING A SESSION AND WHAT IS MISSED 
BY OUR RUDIMENTARY HUMAN HEARING AND CAUGHT ON A RECORDING RIVALS OR 
MAY EVEN GIVEN ENOUGH TIME FOR FREQUENCY IMPRINTING BY OUR SPIRIT 
FRIENDS AND PROPER RESEARCH METHODS WILL SURPASS JOE'S BOX AND PULL A 
CLOSE SECOND TO FRANK'S BOX. 

AS A MATTER OF FACT MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE RS BOX WAS REMINICENT 
OF THE AM LINEAR MODE OF MY FRANKS BOX #12. LET'S FACE IT A FRANKS 
BOX IS A FRANKS BOX IN AS NO TWO ARE EXACTLY THE SAME THAT IS WHAT 
MAKES THEM SO UNIQUE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT I BELIEVE A SMALL PART OF 
FRANK HIMSELF TRANSFERS INTO EVERY BOX HE MAKES AND HE IS VERY WELL 
RESPECTED ON THE OTHER SIDE FROM WHAT MY GUIDES AND TECHS TELL ME.

I HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE RON RICKETS MINI BOX YET BUT I 
AM HEARING VERY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT'S PERFORMANCE ALSO AND CAN NOT 
WAIT TO EXPERIMENT WITH IT.

I THINK OUR FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE FINALY DECIDING TO PUSH 
FORWARD WITH THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS AND ALLOW IT TO BECOME 
ACCESABLE TO MANY MORE PEOPLE. WHAT THEY HAVE CONVEYED TO ME OVER 
NUMEROUS SESSIONS IS THE DESPERATE AND INTRIGAL NEED FOR COMBINED 
HARMONY AMONG RESEARCHERS AND COMMUNICATORS. THE MORE MINDS THAT ARE 
THINKING AND MOVING TOGETHER FOR THIS COMMON GOAL THE STRONGER THE 
SPIRITS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE AND THEY WILL HELP WITH DEVELOPE MENT 
OF THE TECHNOLOGY SO THINGS ARE LOOKING UP AND HEADING TO THE FUTURE. 

WHAT I HAVE GATHERED OVER MANY SESSIONS IS THEY DEFINATELY WANT THE 
WORD AND THE TECHNOLOGY SPREAD TO AS MANY AS ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT IT 
WITH AN OPEN MIND. I AM RATTLING ON AND HAVE DRIFTED FROM MY ORIGINAL 
POINT WHICH WAS, THIS RADIO SHACK BOX IS AND WILL BE A VERY IMPORTANT 
AND USEFULL TOOL IN FURTHERING OUR COMMUNICATION PROCESS.

THANKS FOR LISTENING.

BRUCE
