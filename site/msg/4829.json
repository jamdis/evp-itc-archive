Any help?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;DAna&quot; &lt;cute_blonde_n_corpus23@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now I am sure you arent aware of who I am being, noone else other \n&gt; &gt; than misty welcomed me to this group. Being I am not professional \nat \n&gt; &gt; e.v.p.s but yet have gone through listening to many of them from \n&gt; &gt; trustful resources, your e.v.p.s make me a bit leery. NOt trying \nto \n&gt; &gt; be rude, so dont go get all upset right off the bat. In your \ne.v.p.s, \n&gt; &gt; this one especially, alot of them sound like you, not the part \nwhere \n&gt; &gt; you asking questions, but where your dad is supposively answering \n&gt; &gt; you. NOw everyone has their own right to opinion so there is now \nneed \n&gt; &gt; to get defensive, if all is real there would be nothing to get \nmad \n&gt; &gt; about. I just cant help but notice how odd it is that your e.v.p. \n&gt; &gt; questions to your father, seems to answer right away when you ask \nthe \n&gt; &gt; question. Also, i notice that after you ask the question i hear \n&gt; &gt; something being turned on that has contains the answer to that \n&gt; &gt; question. Whether it be your dad or not. I feel its you that is \n&gt; &gt; answering, but let me tell you why i figure this.. and please you \n&gt; &gt; would like to defend you side of things that would be great, \nmaybe i \n&gt; &gt; would be able to change my opinion on the matter. But as of now, \n&gt; &gt; e.v.p.s are usually done on the same tape that the questions are \non, \n&gt; &gt; then in a rewind you can hear you and the e.v.p. but to me it \nsound \n&gt; &gt; like you put the e.v.p. response on another tape. i am not trying \nto \n&gt; &gt; start any kind of fight or be cruel, maybe i could learn \nsomething on \n&gt; &gt; behalf of how you do your work... thank you\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
