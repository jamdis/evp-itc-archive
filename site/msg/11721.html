Hi Debbie,
 
The puck is not the same thing as the Ovilus 1.  The puck has to be  attached 
to a computer to be used.  The Ovilus 1 is a handeld device  and needs an 
external speaker.  I found out today that it appeared on  paranormal States but 
this device has been out for a few months now.   Unfortunately I have to sell 
some of my toys so I can purchase a few  more toys that are a bit pricey.  
These are the boss's rules so I have to  abide by them.  I could put it out there 
on Ebay but I wanted to give  someone here a chance to purchase it for the 
price that I paid for it rather  than the price of a new one.
 
Jeff

Jeff,
Do you know what the paranormal puck is? Is it the same  thing?
How did you know about this Ovilus 1 before it was on  Paranormal State?
Do- you -know-someone? Or are you involved in the making  of this?
And what NEW TOYS are out there that we don't know  about?
I have alot of questions don't I ? Can't help  it........
You can sell it on ebay...... Why would you want to get  rid of it though, if 
it
works?

Hi Elabeth,
 
You have to remember much of what the Ovilus 1 said probably ended up on  the 
editing room floor.  But it does work.  I get great responses  from mine.  
The (7) different modes on it work very well.  But if  you know anyone who wants 
one please let me know.  I was informed I  have to sell some of my toys to 
afford to buy new toys...LOLOL  I would  sell it for $165.00 and it is in brand 
new condition and only used a few  times.

I thought it was pretty neat that it repeated the word "worry"  when
Ryan asked if it was worried they'd bring in a priest.
What are  the odds of that just based on environmental readings? If I
had an extra  $200 laying around I'd be buying myself one to play  with.
