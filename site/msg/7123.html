<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think your right sir:

I have found a way to make a box that everyone can use, and I may just
do it now!  I have a way to put a box on a telephone line and set it
up so it can be operated by the phones DTMF tones.  You can power it
on and off, control vol, scan rate, band, ect.  I could have it all
recorded and then emailed to the caller.  If I made it open to anybody
with a phone it might be &quot;less&quot; of an ego trip for the people involved
in this.  I would like to hear your thoughts on this idea.
Rob.

&gt; Hi All;
&gt;  I&#x27;m wondering why some many that do this &quot;reseach&quot; go mash potatoes
in the head, developing what seems to be that messiah complex. Box
user after box user seems to go down this road. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s
just human ego, or they get possessed, or what. Maybe it&#x27;s blinded by
dollar signs!? Maybe it&#x27;s like the Brookings Report, people just can
not handle the truth on a psychological/ego level. I think that report
applies to all encounters with  the vastness of the universe. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I can&#x27;t provide boxes for anyone else until I figure this stuff
out. It&#x27;s not ethical to give people something that has the potential
of fucking them up, to be blunt. I wanted to give these boxes out to
see how it worked for others, to see if they got something like I did,
and so far it&#x27;s very disappointing. It&#x27;s almost like an experiment on
people, except most were pretty much begging for, and demanding the
things. Even if it&#x27;s not the boxes per se`, that&#x27;s even more reason to
avoid the situation.
