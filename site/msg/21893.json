I\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; scare easily.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have tried for dozens, maybe hundreds of hours to get an EVP recording\n&gt;&gt; at\n&gt;&gt; my home with a regular digital voice recorder. I have never gotten a peep\n&gt;&gt; there that way. I have also tried in locations that would not be suspect\n&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; being haunted, like random open country roads and fields. I never got\n&gt;&gt; anything in those either.  I have gotten many EVP&#39;s in cemeteries and in\n&gt;&gt; some buildings that were supposedly haunted. This makes me think that this\n&gt;&gt; method does tap into something that is localized and exists only in small\n&gt;&gt; areas.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I guess my house isn&#39;t one of those locations.\n&gt;&gt; :-(\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have gotten names on EVP&#39;s a few times and in each case the name could\n&gt;&gt; be\n&gt;&gt; associated with the location from past records (newspapers, hospital\n&gt;&gt; records, etc.) These were names of real people long dead.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The radio scanning boxes may tap into a different kind of entity. I don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; know. But my experiences indicate that &quot;ghosts&quot; do only inhabit certain\n&gt;&gt; small areas and they do not go outside those areas.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Zack\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Mon, Aug 15, 2011 at 10:57 AM, purplespacefriend &lt;\n&gt;&gt; purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; **\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t mean paranormal activity, I mean--875 members and no one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; texting.
