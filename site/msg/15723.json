The predictions you were touting were for August 15,\n&gt; and included end-of-the-world warning..  Trying to say these were correct,\n&gt; but not REALLY for August 15, and not REALLY end-of-the-world stuff, seems\n&gt; like a way to save face, or keep hoping the messages are real, when in fact,\n&gt; this is another example that they are not.\n&gt;\n&gt; So from now on, you will no longer hear clear dates and predictions.  You\n&gt; may hear vague dates and vague predictions if you like, but you will not\n&gt; hear anything that can be confirmed.  Doing so would put you in a position\n&gt; of having to question the verity of the EVP data you collect.  And that\n&gt; might lead to abandoning this while area of study.  And we know you cannot\n&gt; do that.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Sun, 8/16/09, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Calm thyself-again and again and again.....\n&gt; To: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, August 16, 2009, 3:08 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Well, it seems the original prediction of the east coast getting clobbered\n&gt; is probably correct. Where I fell down was trying to ask questions and\n&gt; getting BS doomsville junk. I knew it&#39;s a mistake to ask questions, that\n&gt; like opens the door for the dark dorks. I&#39;m going back to just announcing\n&gt; I&#39;m doing an EVP recording, and just record. They know what I&#39;m thinking and\n&gt; what I need to know and who I would like to hear from. Asking questions, at\n&gt; least for me, has always lead to problems. I&#39;m not like others, presumming\n&gt; I&#39;m so smart and know what is talking, and if it&#39;s honest, like most of the\n&gt; box experts out there on the web. You know, the ones doing pod casts, radio\n&gt; shows and proclaiming this that and the other thing.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nJR...
