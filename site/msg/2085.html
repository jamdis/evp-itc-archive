James,
That is a really good question and worthy of some serious thought.
I believe it is entirely possible for our subconscious mind to 
generate the electrical energy impulses to form an evp, BUT most evp 
researchers if not all believe that a spirit or entity places the evp 
or message directly onto the recording medium and I believe that with 
franks box the spirit will use the different fragments of energy 
provided by the box to form words and phrases that are fed directly 
through the boxes circuitry and that allows us to hear the message in 
real time.

I do not believe an evp that is captured on location or in a 
controlled environment is placed on the recording medium by the 
researcher or investigator for the simple reason that the energy 
generated by our physical brain which while in the physical houses 
our spirit would have to consciously direct that energy in the form 
of words or use the power of the mind to harness the ambient energy 
in the room or location and place it onto or into the recorder. and I 
don&#x27;t think that is the case. are we capable of generating spiritual 
energy that could theoretically create an evp, yes do we have the 
capacity to create said evp and place it were we would need it to be 
unconsciously no I don&#x27;t believe we have that capability. Where as a 
spirit that is made up solely of spirit energy could intelligently
manipulate and place the energy to create the evp.

but that&#x27;s just one researchers opinion !
