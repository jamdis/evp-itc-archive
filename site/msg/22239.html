Came across this article today, and when I asked tech spirit, David about  
the guy, David says; "the guy died in a car accident back in early 80's, I 
think  in  83, and "he will never see the light, he doesn't even seem to know 
 that what he did to the kids was wrong, he is one that will stay in the  
darkness, and simply be destroyed at Judgement."
