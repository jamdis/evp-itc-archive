Margaret,
 
the enhancement that was done on the images was used for tryin=
g to bring the image forward out of the glare 
the suns reflection caused. =
The technique was developed out of necessity. The discovery of the imageing=
 process 
and the development of the enhancement process is mine.
 
I never=
 added or removed any features or detail from those images, the only enhanc=
ement was done to brightness, contrast
and levels. All of these control the=
 light and dark of the image they promote the toning down of the glare to e=
nhance and bring out
the details of the image. 
 
I have never denied that =
I enhanced them, I even posted before and after comparison pics on IAH so t=
hat everyone could see
what was acomplished with the enhancement process, a=
nd that the image could be seen in the original capture but the glare preve=
nted
seeing any detail. I had at times actually sat and watched as a spirit=
 face turned it's face and looked directly at me.

Hi Br=

 copied yours. All I remember thinking is, boy, that's a whole lot of steps=
 to go through to get to the final impressive images, and I wondered what m=
