Rhonda,
 
Everyone is misunderstanding my point.
my whole post was about s=
topping any furtherance of the negative
vibrations this issue was already c=
ausing and that would have been empowered by 
an attempt to sabotage this i=
diot on ebay.
 
I am the first to advocate putting out information on hacki=
ng your own box and educating people about our research
and to be aware of =
the snake oil salesman that are lurking in the shadows.
 
Most of the unedu=
cated people that are seeing a box or information about one, right now are =
doing so mainly because
of the publicity the box received on the tv show pa=
ranormal state. So I believe that when a new individual is begging a 
searc=
h for knowledge about what is being done with this method, they are not goi=
ng to go to ebay first for their initial source 
of information they may vi=
sit ebay after they derive their initial information and decide to get invo=
lved with our work.
But I think their first venue for knowledge would be a =
google search, I know that's what mine was.
 
All I was trying to say was t=
hat there are much more suitable places for these individuals to have acces=
s to the information you want to put on ebay, and lets face it, the initial=
 reaction to this whole thing was not the concern of the people getting the=
 boxes, 
it was to stop the asshole that was selling the boxes. Which actua=
lly "If you cut off the head of the snake" still in all the immediate 
emot=
ion was one of anger and subversion of this individual. That in itself brin=
gs negative vibration to the field, it's the ripple in the pond affect.
 
A=
lso I believe that people that have decide to start their hunt for a box an=
d wind up at ebay, already have the mindset to buy the box if they see it.
=
And if they see the actual box for sale and then see an advertisement that =
is just that and not the actual box, chances are they will concentrate on t=
he actual box
and ignore the advert.
 
If we feel as a group that something=
 needs to be done, we should try and reach these people before they get to =
ebay at all! If we can come up with an education campaign that
utilizes all=
 obvious venues of paranormal information which is the first spot anyone wi=
ll look, then count me in 100%
 
But as far as launching a campaign against=
 this one sad individual under the guise of helping people not get swindled=
, I know for myself and I am being completely truthful with you and myself
=
my first motivation would be to stick it to this guy and if I helped some p=
eople avoid a bad deal in doing that all the better. So that's what I meant=
 by negativity attached to the box.
 
Lets get the word out to the paranorm=
al community and they will steer the inquiries our way. That's when we real=
ly can help.

Hi Bruce. I don't see this so much as an assault on anyone, as =
it is simply bringing awareness into a forum (ebay) where it is desperately=
 needed. Was it not you who recently stated sellers who take advantage of o=
thers in this way are "no more than thieves without guns" and "should not b=
e patronized no matter the circumstances." You have characterized them as "=
wolves" and "demons" but now are saying "do nothing." Which, honestly, I co=
uld understand if my suggestion was coming from a place of vengeance. It is=
 not.THIS IS ABOUT EDUCATION FIRST AND FOREMOST, and standing up for those =
who are, unknowingly, being taken advantage of. The byproduct of providing =
this education will be allowing consumers to make an informed decision and =
if that hurts the sales of unscrupulous sellers, then so be it. Ann has jus=
t echoed some of my remarks in earlier posts in support of sellers rights t=
o take advantage of the market ... that some people may find it's worth it =
to pay more to someone to receive a previously hacked unit. I would venture=
 to guess, this educational information will A) help prevent those who are =
capable of doing the hack themselves from being duped, and B) force sellers=
 who do offer pre-hacked units to do so for a more 'reasonable' fee. This i=
s neither spiteful nor aggressive, and it's certainly not any kind of venge=
ance driven on my part. It's standing up for the uninformed, leveling the p=

doing 'box' research is not an exclusive club that only the rich can take p=
art in (and given the pricing on the bids for these units, people are under=
 the false assumption that you have a pay a high price to get your hands on=
 a limited resource, when that simply is not the case.)I can see nothing bu=

 sole searching and a lot of <BR>> communication interpretation from our=
 friends on the other side.<BR>> But I have come to learn that aggressiv=
e action in any form is <BR>> detrimental to the harmony and peace of th=
e whole involved.<BR>> <BR>> Guy's like this guy on ebay do not and c=
an not last in the face of <BR>> good and well intentioned people that a=
re here and willing and trying <BR>> to get the word of this miraculous =
research and spirit communication <BR>> out to as many people as are in =
need or want of it.<BR>> <BR>> That is how we can stop people like th=
is bottom feeder. By spreading <BR>> the knowledge of this research from=
 one person to the next. Our <BR>> friends have stated time and time aga=
in that any negative energy will <BR>> be detrimental to the communicati=
on and the research, and positive <BR>> harmony and vibration will serve=
 to strengthen the bridge between our <BR>> worlds.<BR>> <BR>> So =
even if you are not religious and do not believe in Jesus Christ <BR>> a=
s I do, these words ring true no matter what context they come from<BR>>=
 this wisdom was spoken by my lord two thousand years ago.<BR>> <BR>>=
 "do not check the splinter in your brothers eye, until you have <BR>> c=
hecked the plank in your own"<BR>> <BR>> Truthfully, anything we coul=
d do to sway this individuals sale of <BR>> these boxes would be minimal=
. Negativity and greed always find a <BR>> crack to seep through.<BR>>=
; <BR>> My suggestion is lets try a little harder to spread the word of =
the <BR>> research and educate individuals that are or may become intere=
sted, <BR>> through all the various outlets available to us on the web c=
oncerning <BR>> the paranormal research community. There are endless cha=
t boards, <BR>> groups and forums plus websites and word of mouth. <BR>&=
gt; Instead of trying to stop this idiot from defrauding innocent <BR>> =
unknowledgable people. Lets make sure the knowledge is out there for <BR>&g=
t; them and we are here to help them and guy's like Mr. ebay will <BR>> =
disappear on their own.<BR>> <BR>> And we will not have expended an o=
unce of negative energy in the <BR>> process.<BR>> That's how I feel,=
 but that's just me.<BR>> <BR>> Bruce<BR>><BR><BR><BR></DIV><SPAN =
