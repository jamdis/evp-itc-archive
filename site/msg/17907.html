Well, got no response out of the other list,  let's see if any of you folks 
on these lists can hear these at all. They may be  too fast, but I did try 
to slow them a bit,  I know, these  are very hard to hear, got them last 
night in response to Steve's letter about  all the "religious"  crap I've been 
sending,  such weird files I  sometimes send in lately.  I do not control 
what spirits say though, after  all they are just people too.  Got one on here 
that's really funny, I think  it has a little demon on it too, he seems 
very angry, and wants someone to "Let  me out!  Let me out!" is what he is 
saying, I think he is wanting to come  after some folks, because, even demon's 
believe in God.  He really  sounds mad at some people and wants ".....out," 
just going to let you hear it,  may need to play it several times to hear, 
but I think its kinda cute. I told  them what some on the lists were saying, 
and this was the  response.  btw  Is someone going to Florida ?  The last one 
says  something about FL Hope you all enjoy them.  sf
