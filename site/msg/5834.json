This may be a good opportunity to get help with my \ntechnical challange here in Mexico.  I have posted what I recorded \nfrom AM signals along the beach here on the Gulf with the recorder \npatched directly into the RS 12 469.  Most channels are Spanish \nlanguage although one or two channels skip across the Gulf \nfromTexas.  So you shouldn&#39;t hear many English words from the radio \nif any.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I am submitting this because, with the help of this group, I \nrecently learned that I have been missing all the messages on my \nrecordings.  That is...I couldn&#39;t hear anything where others with \nexperience hear plenty.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   My previous post was with EVP maker.  If somethng could be heard \non the RS recording patched directly into my recorder that would be \nanother amazing event for me.  I of course hear nothing from the \nother side.
