First one says, "guess who loves you" the  second one is my mom, saying, 
"Shawnie Poo, and then a man says, "bonnie, your  mother."  David told me the 
reason it's so hard to hear some of the spirits  is because they are on a 
higher level, and farther away, btw, this is my  mother's voice, but it is 
hard to hear her.  Shawnie poo is my son, she  always liked to call him Shawnie 
poo ever since he was little.  Take my  word for it, this stuff is the real 
thing!  sf
