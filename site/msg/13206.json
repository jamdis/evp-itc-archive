It is 3 devices all rolled into  one.  The\n&gt; inventor,\n&gt; Gary, is an awesome guy too.  He built this meter  and named it after his\n&gt; daughter so it has a sentimental value to him.  You  will love it\n&gt; .............\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff\n&gt; **************New year...new news.  Be the first to know what is making\n&gt; headlines.
