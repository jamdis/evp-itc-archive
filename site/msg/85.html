heres the deal
  i dont know how this happened but i have 10 minutes of white noise to a file to i can pop it open for recording...........somehow me coughing and saying hello is in that file, which doeswnt make anysense, you click white noise and then a box pops open and you type how many seconds, i did 10 and saved the file. WELLLLLLL when i used that file today on evpmaker, it CHANGED my voice the coughing sound and me saying hello to a completly different tone.........low slow and creepy lol. I am getting pissed off. i didnt hear me coughing or saying hello when i was recording with evpmaker though, but when i just played the whitenoise file there i was...............hummmmm how did i get INTO a file that wasnt actually recorded? rather played and saved? and didnt hear it on evpmaker, maker changes my voice tone? i think im done using evp maker, or something really weird is going on.
