In that \n&gt; &gt; chamber, you will want probably an amplified microphone running \n&gt; into \n&gt; &gt; your voice recorder, to pick up the sounds bouncing around in \n&gt; there.  \n&gt; &gt; You can also add some white noise into the box, but I think \npeople \n&gt; &gt; are getting results without adding the additional noise. The \n&gt; chamber \n&gt; &gt; seems to really bounce the sound around and give you a good mix \nto \n&gt; &gt; record.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rita&quot; &lt;nvrenuf1031@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; New to group here.  We just completed the advance hack on our \n469 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; model.  Are you supposed to hear the voices from the radio \n&gt; stations \n&gt; &gt; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; just white noise?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, is it best to hook up an external speaker, one or two, in \n&gt; &gt; order \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to record to a digital recorder?  What is the best way to \nrecord, \n&gt; &gt; using \n&gt; &gt; &gt; digital recorder, or direct into PC using Sound recorder, and \n&gt; using \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; line in/line out connection?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What is the recommended length of sessions.  Should I try just \na \n&gt; &gt; minute \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or two, or longer at one sitting?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks to all!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rita\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
