Last year I asked &quot;Do \nyou \n&gt; know \n&gt; &gt; what year it is?&quot; and a woman&#39;s voice plainly said &quot;1996&quot;. On \none \n&gt; &gt; investigation I asked &quot;Do you want us to leave?&quot; and a male \nvoice \n&gt; said \n&gt; &gt; &quot;You just got here.&quot; At another site someone asked &quot;What was \nyour \n&gt; cause \n&gt; &gt; of death?&quot; and I heard &quot;poisoning&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s funny when the ghosts join in on your conversations even \n&gt; though \n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re not asking questions.  Some of them are very playful.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was on one investigation a couple years ago when someone \n&gt; asked &quot;Do you \n&gt; &gt; know the Cubs are in the World Series this year?&quot;  :-)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you are at the location of a tombstone you can ask if the \n&gt; person is \n&gt; &gt; (name on tombstone) or knows (name on tombstone).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope those help a little bit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zack\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Thu, 28 Jun 2007, Steve Hultay wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to do another EVP session with the box, but am tired of \n&gt; asking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same questions.
