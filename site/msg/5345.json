What about other frequencies, e.g., walkie-talkie \n&gt; &gt; channels (public, private and government), television broadcast \n&gt; &gt; channels, and all the in-between frequencies?  In other words, \n&gt; while \n&gt; &gt; scanning, for example, an AM channel, would it not be possible \nfor \n&gt; &gt; the radio receiver to pick up another band, let&#39;s say, short-\nwave?  \n&gt; &gt; The reason I&#39;m asking is that years ago I was dictating something \n&gt; &gt; into the hand-held mic of a cheap cassette tape recorder and \n&gt; imagine \n&gt; &gt; my surprise when in playing back what I&#39;ve just dictated, instead \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; hearing just my voice, I also heard in the background a two-way \n&gt; &gt; conversation between truckers using their CB radios that my cheap \n&gt; mic \n&gt; &gt; had picked up while I was recording!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My point is even if we&#39;re scanning only certain frequencies, \ncan&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; other frequencies bleed through and if so, perhaps this may be \nthe \n&gt; &gt; reason for some of the non-sequitor responses picked by the boxes?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Another question:  Astronomers use scanning devices to pick up \n&gt; &gt; signals from outer space -- are their receivors constructed on \n&gt; &gt; basically the same principles as the radio receivers in the ITC \n&gt; &gt; boxes? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks everyone,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sharon the Ignorant\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
