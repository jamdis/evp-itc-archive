<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, first, we saged and salted.  That really fed the energy to the point
we had to leave the house for a few hours.  We did the same thing again
and again.  Then, a friend in CA called and together, on the phone, we got
rid of it.  You should have heard my emf meter beeping it&#x27;s freaking head
off while my friend sent his energy to get it to go.  I had it on the end
of my daughters bed...where usually there is nothing to set it off.  Boy,
did it ever react to the &quot;banishing&quot; for lack of a better word.  My friend
in CA is a sensitive, and helped me a great deal..I am forever thankful
for him.

&gt; I apologize, I didn&#x27;t know the extent of the matter, I also have a friend
&gt; that had some nasty negative energy attach to them.  I know what he went
&gt; through, and no one should have to go through that.  I glad to hear you
&gt; got rid of it, and I hope it didn&#x27;t hurt your daughter.  If you don&#x27;t mind
&gt; me asking how you got rid of it?

&gt; Actually, it was not cool at all! This spirit attached to my 23 year old
&gt; daughter in a very hostile and perverted way. I have an evp I got in her
&gt; room...I had asked, &quot;Why are you here?&quot; I got &quot; to f--k.&quot; in a very
&gt; gutteral tone. It was awful. Thank God he is gone now and can never
&gt; return.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; That sounds interesting, and Carol you said the spirit followed you home
&gt;&gt; from Waverly... Thats cool, and I would try to get to know the
&gt;&gt; energy/spirit.

&gt;&gt; Andrea,
&gt;&gt; I have experienced this before. In my case it had to do with a spirit
&gt;&gt; that attached itself to us while at Waverly. It became very strong, and
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; had to have assistance to rid my home of him. We also experienced very
&gt;&gt; dense, black masses moving towards us.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Andrea,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sounds like a vortex may have been opening up in your hallway. Have you
&gt;&gt;&gt; had
&gt;&gt;&gt; any paranormal ativity in your house before?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi All,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I am Andrea Carr who is a 41 year old wife and mom of 1 daughter. I am
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorry
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have not written before but I have a terrible year and haven&#x27;t had
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; time to concentrate on EVP like I had prior. I won&#x27;t get into the
&gt;&gt;&gt; details
&gt;&gt;&gt; but it
&gt;&gt;&gt; has left me in the midst of OK just trying to pull through all of this
&gt;&gt;&gt; BS
&gt;&gt;&gt; &amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I will get back to it when I can.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunatley I am leaving for the weekend tomorrow morning and won&#x27;t
&gt;&gt;&gt; see
&gt;&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt; e-mails until Monday morning.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have a question for any one here. I believe in aliens, spirit and
&gt;&gt;&gt; ghost
&gt;&gt;&gt; communications via evp but tonight I had an experience I never had
&gt;&gt;&gt; before.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I woke up at exactly 2:22 by my stove&#x27;s clock and went and cleaned my
&gt;&gt;&gt; sink
&gt;&gt;&gt; of dishes while I heated up some cream chipped beef (albiet not too
&gt;&gt;&gt; exciting)
&gt;&gt;&gt; but while I sat there after in the dark with my family sleeping my
&gt;&gt;&gt; hallway
&gt;&gt;&gt; ilummating a light clored blue several times. Anyone else ever seen
&gt;&gt;&gt; this?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I look forward to any responses.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks!
&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrea
&gt;&gt;&gt;
