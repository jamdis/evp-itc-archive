Ominous?  It depends on which side of the fence your on?  I have been in a =
position 
of asking for Angels / Gods protection after sensing what was per=
ceived as evil.
Good and evil / Light & darkness can not exist in the same =
space. You can't have 
one without the other. Negativity will always be ove=
rpowered by Good & darkness 
will always be illuminated by the light.  Nega=
tive entities will try to lie and / or mislead?
You can't always know who y=
our dealing with, but that's part of the investigating process,
isn't it?  =
Asking & Trying to determine who your dealing with?
