Especially in cases where PK may b=\r\ne in play (such as the Ouija example) a remote PK agent could be influencin=\r\ng the planchette. Before ruling this out, consider that the very notion tha=\r\nt anyone is moving anything is problematic for many people. And spirit comm=\r\nunication pushes the edge of the belief envelope for others. In the end, al=\r\nl of this is some form of anomalous phenomena. You could know things of whi=\r\nch you are unaware. Consider that you might be clairvoyant and not even rea=\r\nlize it. If you were to externalize this through a latent PK mechanism, bin=\r\ngo, you are the agent and the source of information.

From my=\r\n own work with mediums and other sensitives, I have learned the perils and =\r\nthe potential pitfalls with our own perceptual systems, memories and recall=\r\n. All of this works against us in even the most trivial experimental set up=\r\n, which is unfortunate but true. This is yet one more reason to exercise ca=\r\nution with solely anecdotal experimental outcomes. You will find that indep=\r\nendent historical validation is actualy pretty tricky, as I have said befor=\r\ne, because it often is not simply factual in nature.
