For example, my file was very clear that said &quot;marker&quot;.  It doesn&#39;t mean that we are all nuts, that&#39;s the information that was given to us.  It was a direct response to a question that i asked.  It&#39;s not our fault that they gave me bad info, they probably didn&#39;t know the answer. \n\nI don&#39;t want to treat them like some retarded idiots over there, i wish to give them respect.  The fact in my mind is that they are saying something and just because they didn&#39;t get your test right doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s any less fascinating to me that something talks that shouldn&#39;t.  They probably could care less what&#39;s on your monitor.  \n\nThey are probably sitting there trying to figure out why you aren&#39;t doing anything yourself.  \n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  DAH! again. There&#39;s way to much expectation created in trying to guess, so\n&gt; participants minds interfere with whatever spirit communication there might\n&gt; be. You do not understand how this communcations works, nor do you\n&gt; understand the effects of the observer, you can not seperate the observer\n&gt; from the event in the pararnormal. therefore any results are invalid--before\n&gt; you go puffing your chest out thinking how clever you are in debunking\n&gt; spirit communication. Even your own expectation that no valid information\n&gt; will be received is enough to block all information. But as usual,\n&gt; skeptic/debunker ignore all!\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Jul 19, 2010 at 1:03 PM, &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; RJ.

This experiment asked for participants to determine what that\n&gt; &gt; object was. Vague or partial answers would not be counted (for example, just\n&gt; &gt; giving a color, shape, size, what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re looking for what\n&gt; &gt; it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#39;t count.\n&gt; &gt; Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means\n&gt; &gt; they chose.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the start of\n&gt; &gt; the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.\n&gt; &gt; The idea with this file is that you could download it at the beginning of\n&gt; &gt; the experiment and &#39;keep it safe&#39; on your computer. Then at the end of the\n&gt; &gt; experiment, I would post the password so you can reveal the contents of the\n&gt; &gt; file. That way, you were in control of the original image during the entire\n&gt; &gt; time, not me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Passworded pdf:\n&gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.pdf\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The password for that file is: 2plus2isFour\n&gt; &gt; Instructions, if you need them for the other files, are also in that RJ\n&gt; &gt; folder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So to the results:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Number of participants: 6\n&gt; &gt; Total tries: 29\n&gt; &gt; Ambiguous answers: 0\n&gt; &gt; Correct answers: 0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Object: Chair\n&gt; &gt; Object picture:\n&gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.jpg\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As a little side experiment, on Monday I also asked if anyone had gotten\n&gt; &gt; any answers that might indicate an article of clothing (though I did not say\n&gt; &gt; why I was asking). One theory is that the human operator can be influenced\n&gt; &gt; by things they already know or suspect, and so interpret audio with their\n&gt; &gt; own personal &#39;educated guesses&#39;, that would differ from what they would hear\n&gt; &gt; had they not known those things. This side experiment did indicate some\n&gt; &gt; support for that theory, since before I mentioned &#39;articles of clothing&#39;, no\n&gt; &gt; one included an article of clothing in their results. But after I mentioned\n&gt; &gt; it, several reports of clothing began to appear. I did not add these tries\n&gt; &gt; to the results above.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let me\n&gt; &gt; know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this experiment.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
