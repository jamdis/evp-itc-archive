<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have a question for those of you who have been doing this research
for a while.  Since doing the research, have you noticed an increase
in your &quot;intuitive&quot; senses?  By that I mean, has your hearing been
heightened to the point of hearing conversations when you are alone? 
Or seeing things more clearly spirit wise?  Or am I just nuts and need
to be committed?  

I had to ask.  It&#x27;s a very strange thing.  These things have been
happening to me and I&#x27;m wondering if you have experienced the same
thing or close to it.
