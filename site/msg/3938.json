I just thought that since we are all spread out all over, it just might be something to try.  I know your in CA, but I am not sure where everyone else except Frank.  \n   \n  I only have the hacked box so If we set up different boxes at different times, we would have to see who has what and when everyone is available.  \n   \n  I would be more than happy to help with this exercise.  Do you think it would matter if all our communication is different?\n   \n  I would be excited to see all of the Frank&#39;s Box users do a test and well as a combination of boxes.  I think it would make for some exciting EVP and confirmation that the other planes just may communication regardless of time, space and location.\n\npsi_research &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n          Some members of the Big Circle at the AA-EVP do this.
