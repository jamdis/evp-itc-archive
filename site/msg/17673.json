Friday was relatively uneventful and average, but Saturday had a few startling downward spikes.\n\nOf course, it&#39;s still early unless this is going to be one pip of an event.  I wouldn&#39;t expect to see anything significant for the 17th any earlier than the 15th.  In addition, we may not see reactions until the 19th.  These seem to vary with the apparently-related incident/s.\n\nIf anyone else wants to follow the numbers, check http://noosphere.princeton.edu/\n\nGenerally, I&#39;m watching the &quot;day summary&quot; pages, linked at the left on the site&#39;s homepage.  For the clearest visual cues, wait for the day summary page to load and then scroll all the way down to the Overlaid Individual Eggs.\n\nAt first, this will seem like a sea of numbers and nothing but colorful masses of lines.\n\nI&#39;ve been watching this site for years, off & on, and it&#39;s making general sense to me now... though I&#39;m very far from being an expert.\n\nCheerfully,\nFiona\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rasterer&quot; &lt;rasterer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, the  17th is this coming Thursday.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;"}
