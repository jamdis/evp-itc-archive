Yes, that bo=

 spray the other side of the board with spray paint and let dry. I like to =
use the clear coat paint but it doesn't really matter.

=C2=A0
After you've=
 etched one side, clean the paint and the photoresist=C2=A0off (clean both =
sides)=C2=A0with acetone, MEK, etc. Do this in a well-ventilated area! Then=
 drill your holes.
=C2=A0
If you are going to make a double-sided board, dr=
ill a few of the holes that have common pads on both sides to orient the pa=
ttern on the other side and repeat whatever method you use to put a resist =
on that side. After it's developed/ironed on, spray the already etched side=
 with paint and etch the other side. Clean off the board and drill holes.
