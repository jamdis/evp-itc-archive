<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I tried the FET AM detector from the older ARRL handbook again, its&#x27; 
supposed to be less distortion, but I can&#x27;t get it to work as well as 
the diode detector. I had some chipping in my #30 box, and it was cuz 
the last IF can wasn&#x27;t grounded. 

 The AM band was all noisy tonihgt, and I&#x27;m asking out loud why, I got 
a direct response for the box, &quot;it&#x27;s snowing!&quot;. I checked a pocket AM 
radio and it was noisy as well, I didn&#x27;t know snow put out static, but 
you do get lightning in a snow strom sometimes.
