    I believe the documentary th=

  Still, it's a great review and I pretty much agree with everything the au=

          Does Nostrad=
amus agree with the Mayan calendar about a coming change?

          By Ste=
phen Wagner, July 13, 2009

          On July 10, 2009, The History Channel=
 aired a two-hour documentary on the prophecies of Nostradamus and how they=
 might relate to 2012. It was the latest in a growing heap of information, =
theories, fears, warnings, enlightenment and anxiety about the year 2012, s=
o perhaps it's time I throw in my two cents. 

          I have never put m=
uch stock in the supposed Mayan prophecy that 2012 will mark the end of the=
 world, the end of an era or however you want to view it. I mean, haven't w=
e been through this countless times? Some predicted May 5, 2000, as doomsda=
y because the planets were in rough alignment. Then there was the hysteria =
over the millennium and Y2K. And of course various religious cults have nam=
ed date after date when the world would surely end, all of which came and w=
ent without so much as a hiccup. 

          The year 2012 will be no diffe=
rent. Yes, the subject is selling a lot of books, drawing large audiences f=
or talk radio and counting up lots of hits on websites, but I think that's =
the most drama we'll get out of 2012. It, too, will come and go without a m=
ajor shift on the planet. Don't we all really know that? 

          Those =
promoting the 2012 changes have thrown out a wide range of possibilities fo=
r what might happen =E2=80=93 everything from a literal end of the world, t=
o dramatic social, economic, political and climatic upheaval, to a "spiritu=
al awakening," which, of course, could mean almost anything.

          Why=
 2012?

          And what is it based on? Primarily, it's based on an anci=
ent Mayan "long count" calendar, carved on stone, which according to calcul=
ations ends on December 21, 2012 and marks the end of a 5,126-year era. Wit=
hout a doubt, the ancient Mayans were remarkable mathematicians and astrono=
mers, but can we really take this "prophecy" seriously? First of all, it's =
not even a prophecy. It happens to be when their long count calendar ends. =
Why should that hold any significance for us? 

          The second reason=
 proponents of this coming apocalypse say it is on its way is that in 2012 =
there will be an alignment of sorts with the center of our galaxy. Because =
the Earth wobbles slowly as it rotates (once about every 26,000 years) the =
sun will appear to rise in alignment with the center of the Milky Way. Inte=
resting, yes, but there seems to be no cosmological evidence of any kind th=
at this should have an effect on our planet, physically, socially or even s=
piritually. 

          The third reason touted is that the sun is schedule=
d to be at a "solar maximum" in that year, a time when sun spots and solar =
flares are very active. This kind of activity really can cause problems. Su=
ch activity can disable and damage satellites and can have a dramatic effec=
t on the Earth's weather. The schedule is based on past patterns of such ac=
tivity, but we have no way of knowing whether it will happen in 2012, and i=
f it does how severe it might be. 

          Strained Interpretations

   =
       Back to the Nostradamus documentary for a moment. As usual, the Nost=
radamus experts quoted a selection of his quatrains =E2=80=93 those that fe=
ature famine, pestilence, war, etc. =E2=80=93 and strained to tie them into=
 2012. Not successfully, in my opinion. The world has always been plagued w=
ith famine, pestilence, war and the rest of it, and I saw no quatrain that =
even remotely indicated that what Nostradamus was talking about was the yea=
r 2012.

          Aside from the quatrains, the documentary focused mainly=
 on the so-called "Lost Book of Nostradamus, " which was discovered in a mo=
dern library in Rome in 1994. Dating to 1629, the manuscript, filled the br=
ight watercolor drawings, is titled Nostradamus Vatinicia Code and has on t=
he inside the name Michel de Notredame as the author. First of all, althoug=
h this "lost book" is thought by some to be the work of Nostradamus, there =
is no definitive proof or scholarly consensus that he was actually the auth=
or; some experts have serious doubts. So to make this book the platform for=
 this documentary puts it on very shaky ground. 

          And then the le=
ngths to which the talking heads on the show reached and strained to connec=
t the drawings to 2012 was positively ludicrous. For example, the drawing o=
f a sword, held pointing up and around which is looped a banner or scroll (=
see illustration above) =E2=80=93 this was interpreted as the sun's alignme=
nt with the galactic center in 2012. Really? The other drawings were likewi=
se twisted and mangled to fit the interpretations needed for the argument. =
We all know that we can take such enigmatic drawings =E2=80=93 and quatrain=
s =E2=80=93 and interpret them to fit virtually any scenario that we want. =


          So What Will Happen?

          Why are some people obsessed wi=
th 2012 (apart from its marketing aspects)? Why are they obsessed with apoc=
alypse and the end of the world? Why is it always seen as right around the =
corner? 

          I think the answer is that we both fear and want great =
change. As wonderful as the world can be, it is, as noted earlier, continua=
lly plagued by war, economic difficulties, famine and climate shifts. This =
stuff is not new. They are continuing problems that ebb and flow on the pla=
net. While we fear that it's going to get worse (and it certainly can get w=
orse), at the same time we have the hope that it's going to get better. We =
fear the catastrophes of an apocalypse, yet we hope for that spiritual awak=
ening that will save us from our own human nature. 

          I'm no Nostr=
adamus, but here's my prediction for 2012: the world will continue on prett=
y much as it has in the past. There will be dire problems and there will be=
 great joys. Perhaps some problems will get a bit worse than they are right=
 now, but there will be no earth-shattering catastrophe. If there is a spir=
itual awakening, it won't be on a planetary or mass scale through some unsp=
ecified miracle, as some hope, it will be as individuals. (But that has not=
hing to do with 2012.) The best we can shoot for is that as individuals we =
do our best to make our own small fragments of the Earth better places. Thi=
s has always been the case and ever shall be.
