Some folks think it is a modulated em field in proximity to the microphone. There is evidence to support this, as evp has been recorded in faraday cages and vacuum jars. It would then be logical to assume that evp is independent of vibratory sound waves. Then that is blown to hell when you consider that Waldemar Bogoras is credited with the first reported evp capture while recording rituals of the Tchoutki tribe in Siberia in 1901. The was with a mechanical gramaphone-like device, no microphone, just a horn to amplify sound, mechanical &quot;write&quot; needle, and wax cylinder. Electric gramaphones didn&#39;t come about till almost the &#39;20s. In that case it would appear that evp exists as soundwaves and not em fields.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which one is right? Both probably, and that isn&#39;t even taking into account the mechanism involved in box-related evp.\n&gt; \n&gt; Intent and desire to communicate. The rest works itself out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Andy\n&gt; \n\nAnd all of this supports the notion that the real underlying principle is actually psychokinesis, most likely of the operator but possibly of some external agent as well. This would not require any external &#39;power&#39; in the sense we normally think of it, and would explain why such voices are recorded in powered and non-powered devices all using various recording media. It would also explain the presence of audio and video since PK appears to be an ability to affect the environment with the mind, which could extend to manipulating or creating video and audio signals. \n\nIn this context, conducting (or perhaps more correctly replicating) tests in Faraday cages makes sense; in that one could then rule out anything electromagnetic as a potential source. It may or may not be the case that the sweep signal is critical to voice production. This is actually a notion that needs further clarification - the presence of noise seems beneficial, but is it required? Finding voices inside a Faraday cage in a replicated test would actually be a very helpful outcome to advancing the research."}
