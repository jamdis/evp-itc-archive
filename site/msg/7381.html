John,
Frank does not make any boxes to sell. Have already asked, as have many
pe=
ople.
The minibox does work though. Frank has made one of them, and it worked.
They are for sale at this time. The website for ordering one is
www.paranormalsystems.com.
They are 399.00, and you can even make a down payment of 100.00 and=20
you have six months to pay it off.
Hope this helps.
Deb Fransen

Hi Gang,
My name is John Marc Carr, president/founder of SEFGR, South East Florida
=
Ghost Research. I organized this group in 1998, and have been in the
resear=
ch of Ghost and Paranormal happenings ever since. I'm the official
paranorm=
al researcher for the Stranahan House which is Fort Lauderdale's
oldest and=
 most haunted historical landmark. We have gotten many EVP's by
use of digi=
tal recorder. There are 5 intelligent haunts that are in the
house and one =
residual haunt outside of the house. Most of the evp work has
been handled =
by me, but I have been teaching some of my member to work their
own recordi=
ngs.
=20
I am totally fascinated by your use of the "Frank's Box". My congradulatio=
ns
to your success, Frank and those who use the box on the research that yo=
u've
accomplished. In this, I'm also dissappointed by those who have used y=
our
box to make money or notority to gain fame by it. I won't mention names=
, to
mention them will only give them more strength.=20
=20
We are currently trying to do the Radio Shack hack of the 12-469 and hope =
to
be successful in this trial by error. Hoping that our work will produce
=
something that we've been trying to accomplish like you all have, two way
c=
ommunication with astral beings. It's fustrating to do digital recordings
a=
nd having to wait and sift through the recordings to get information. We
ho=
pe to elliminate that with the hack.
=20
Are Frank's boxes available for retail? I've heard of the Mini Box that is=

coming out soon and they are taking pre-orders for this product. Our group=

is small and we don't charge for our research at the historical landmarks
=
that we do here in Fort Lauderdale, so we are looking for the best at the
l=
owest route approach.
=20
Our next project is a Historical Firehouse that is haunted by the ghost of=

Robert Leland Knight. There is a mystery on how he died, but legend goes
t=
hat he fallen in a water puddle that was electricfied by a downed wire. He
=
was a large man and a Golden Glove champ of Florida. It was his second week=

of working at the firestation and he didn't have his gear because it had t=
o
be ordered. There is some who think (psychics) that he might have been
pu=
shed out of the firetruck as a prank that went wrong.
=20
This firehouse has had media play with the Sci-fi channel in a show called=
 
Proof Positive". The firestation is becoming a museum, and is allowing us=
 to
spend the night in doing an investigation about Robert. There are some =
who
believe that some of the haunt has to do with a hanging tree that was a=
t the
opposite corner of the Firestation. We are excited about doing an
inv=
estigation of this Historical Landmark, but are cautious of the fact that
t=
here will be low level spirits/astral beings that might be present.
=20
Frank, If you have the time to answer me, that will be great. Those who ha=
ve
the "Frank's box", if you can tell me how you obtained yours, that will =
be
helpful also. I would be greatful for any help at this point.
=20
Thanks for letting me listen in on all of your discoveries and successes.

Best Regards,
John Marc Carr
