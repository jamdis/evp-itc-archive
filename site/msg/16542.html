Just letting you all know that two of our group members will be on www.PeoplesTvNetwork.com in a few minutes tonight at 8PM EST talking about their use of their box. Come check out Stephen Hill&#x27;s new show &#x27;Echoes From Beyond&#x27; with special guest Jeff Rezman. Frank if you would like to contribute some information I know they would love to hear your insight. Everyone feel free to come join in the chat and watch the live shows. 

Jeff and Nancy Rezman&#x27;s show &quot;One Foot Out Of The Grave&#x27; airs every Wednesday at 9pm EST. They also have a live event next week with the Chicago Paranormal Detectives at their debut party for their new series on A&amp;E television. There will be a question and answer session which you can take part in from the chat rooms.

Another member Steve Hultay also has recently moved his RTSC radio show to PTN and it airs on Sunday nights at 6PM EST. Its great to finally see Steve after knowing him on groups for several years. Come check out his show.

Schedules can be found on the HOME page or main page of the site. There are 3 live events this weekend as well including an investigation at a haunted mansion.

Lots of interesting shows and events going on. There are also some gifted mediums who give FREE readings and spiritual classes on channel 4 at PTN. It&#x27;s free to watch 24/7 and if you miss a show simply go to the channel it aired on and click the on demand button to view past shows.

Have fun and good luck to our members on their shows!
