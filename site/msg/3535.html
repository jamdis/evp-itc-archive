Yeah, it could be the boxes, and any of this kind of technolgy works diffe=

 Yes, I did hear a voice that said "Edison here", wa=

 As for the "technicians", I have never gotten anyone claiming to be =
a technician from the other side, nor have I goten any technical assistence=
 what so ever for any voice from the boxes. I get only unknow voices that t=

 I don't give a crapp who uses the box, and what th=

Chris was the first and=
 only person testing this device for quite sometime, making him the "primar=
y tester". The dictionary defines the word"primary" as being or standing fi=
rst in a list. You offer that he wasalso the first to understand how it was=
 supposed to be used. Yet, nowas more and more people weigh in with their o=
wn opinions you questionyour initial judgment. The fact is that Chris' opin=
ion of how the boxshould be used has never changed. He has held steadfast t=
o hisbeliefs. That, my friend, is an honorable trait in this field and afac=
t that should be considered. Chris has also never claimed this technology t=
o be his own. He hasalways and will always give credit where credit is due.=
 He does thisboth publicly and privately. The use of syntax here on whether=
 we call it Frank's Box, TheTelephone to the Dead, Maxi/Mini Box, or Granol=
a in a can is of noimportance. Truly, because Edison's plans were never dis=
covered thereis no way to know for sure whether or not your plans are exact=
ly whatEdison was working on. There also seems to be a bit of confusion on =
the role the"technicians" play in this along with another syntax issue ( co=
uld thewords network and technician be used interchangeably?). Thetechnicia=
ns are not interpreters. They can provide assistance to thosespirits too ex=
cited or otherwise unable to communicate effectively.And they, the technici=
ans, also serve to assist higher vibrations comethrough (just as your "netw=
ork"). They can also be of benefit whenlower vibrations try to get through.=
 You state you heard a voice say "Edison here" and awhile back you hadposte=
d that you did believe it to in fact be Edison himself. Yet nowyou say the =
"supposed" Edison conversation. As for portals... I've made my concerns cle=
ar previously known.However, I have witnessed the box being used in one loc=
ation only tohave activity spike in another. I've also heard many other sto=
riesrelated to dark or lower entities. So, perhaps you have had noexperienc=
es yet but, others have and they are speaking up. You repeatedly state that=
 Chris is a good guy but then you say "if hecan't use it in an honest manne=
r..." What could be more honest thansomeone sticking to the same beliefs he=
's held since day one? Whatcould be more honorable than stating his fears a=
nd providing what hefeels is a needed warning? Frank, isn't it possible tha=
t you two both bring something separate tothis device? You, the technology =
and science said. Chris, the mediumand spiritual side. Someone posted separ=
ately here about Chris' ego. I can say this...having concern for the possib=
le negative fall out to unsuspectingpeople is in no way ego ridden. To assu=
me that you know Chris'intentions is full of ego. To claim that he only wan=
ts to preventothers from having a device for selfish reasons, is ego's way =
oftelling you that you and everyone else "deserves" to have what we donot f=
ully understand. Ego won't let you consider that because "youwant what you =
want when you want it".BTW- when the word "harmony" is referred to here it =
is not a "feelinginside" like self esteem or some other warm fuzzy. It is a=
boutresonance, vibrations, that which will be matched by like resonanceand =
vibrations. Harmony. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption <franks=
