ok ill jump in. remember when i first started in the group? Those were evps that i had gotten out on ghost hunts. I started at home and took it out on hunts. The thing i really dislike about ghost hunting is that SOME of them are just there to get evidence that life after death does occur but when they find spirits that are trapped or need help crossing over, they do nothing. When they should. But hey thats just my opinion and that and 1.50 will will get you a cup o coffee. I think that sometimes like misty said you start out going oin hunts and moiving on once your "knowledge" has expanded. I think that ghost hunting does do a good service to the public by getting people interested in the after life, then its the folks who do evp that really give it the punch . Alot of people got involved after the movie. I had no clue EVP existed till then, and away i went lol
i think that if you have the ability to help people "see" the light, you should show it to them. oooh yeah and i loved the other day when you said "skep-dicks" i bout rolled on the floor laughing . However, without them, we have NO reason to improve. :)

For some it is all about haunted places. For others theres no such thing as a haunted place. It's a bit different than the work we do but none the less it is still work and putting forth effort with an open mind is what this work is all about no matter which side you approach from. People take many different avenues in the beginning often because they cant quite put a name on what they experienced. Angels, Demons, Spirits, Ghosts, Entities....they are just labels used to describe.
   
  Dont lose patience with them all just because one ticks you off LOL some are on thier way to greater things.
   
  Your boxes have  had success in both types of environments..yours and thiers (ghosthunters). I dont see that as a negative thing Frank. Perhaps a few of the contacting people's intentions are not what they should be. But there are alot of genuine researchers out there that fit both categories. I work from home as  well usually but evp can be picked up most anywhere.

I don't do "investigations", nor do I believe in that stuff. I do all my 
work from my basement. I think the only purpose of EVP is to prove to 
oneself that life is forever. I find these "investigation" sites with  all 
the ghastly images of demons, skeletons, and ghosts an abomination, and very 
mis-leading to anyone that has any interset in non physical research. It's a 
focus on the frightenning for the purpose of giving cheap thrills or making 
a quick buck.

I'm getting "requests" for my systems from these investigator types for my 
boxes. I would prefer that my stuff not be used for these negative purposes, 
for which is is not designed, nor intended. It's intended to be used as a 
home type reciever system for contact with spirits and other enities, not 
for the rather dubious activity of "ghost investigations".
