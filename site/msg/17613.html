"Need I remind anyone how many times "science" has been wrong--over and ove=

Anybody see a problem with this line of thinking?=C2=A0 Anybody see the p=
ure insanity of that said as a factual statement?=C2=A0 Modern Medicine? LO=
L=C2=A0 Ummmmmm basic Physics?=C2=A0 It would be insane, more than that, as=
inine to say that Science has never helped mankind or is a worthless endeav=
or.=C2=A0 <<<<<< Wasted space even having to write the words out.=C2=A0 It =
is unquestionable, on the whole.=C2=A0 

I have seen several bright minds a=
sk for more information.=C2=A0 Studies that are quoted from and "EVP Expert=
s"=C2=A0 Yet I am seeing that information slow to come forth.

You are very=
 correct.=C2=A0 Science has been wrong many times before.=C2=A0 But, it is =
always self correcting.=C2=A0=C2=A0Not because of ego, but because of the v=
ery reason you are mad at it.=C2=A0 It is an unrelenting, cold-hearted swam=
p bitch! LOL =C2=A0 Science is not a thing that cares about what you want o=
r think you hear.=C2=A0 It cares about verifiable, commendable and repeatab=
le evidence.

The problem you are having, well other than not getting the T=
horizie shots on time LOL=C2=A0 Might be, the about lack of logic in the th=
eory to begin with.=C2=A0 

What you are doing is going from point (A) to p=
oint (C)=C2=A0 And never taking a real hard look at point (B)=C2=A0 Now, yo=
u are an electrician guy.=C2=A0 You of all people understand the idea of ci=
rcuits and connections and flow.=C2=A0 The same thing works in Logic and Sc=
ience.

POINT (A)=C2=A0 I am taking a constantly scaning radio and getting =
voices.

POINT (C)=C2=A0 They are talking to me and making sense.=C2=A0 The=
y are telling me all kinds of information that no one could ever know, at l=
east as=C2=A0I perceive it.

Now here is the real kicker!

POINT (B)=C2=A0 =
Yeah this is the hard one.=C2=A0 How do you know they are taking to you?=C2=
=A0 You do understand the nature of the human mind and how it works?=C2=A0 =
Do you understand that this information is nothing new and it dates back to=
 the year 1956? (I am thinking)=C2=A0 

How do you get past point (B)?=C2=
=A0 Do you except it on faith?=C2=A0 That is a Religion.=C2=A0 Can=C2=A0we =
study it as a Science?=C2=A0 

And if we come to our own conclusions about =
things are we not all heretics in the school of "Frank"=C2=A0 Maybe the wor=
d "Church" would be better LOL

Get me past point (B) and I will lead the c=
harge against the ignorant Scientific / Skeptic assholes out to get FRANK.
=

Till then, there are problems with logic.

=C2=A0"Nature is showing us onl=
