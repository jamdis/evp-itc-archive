<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Steve, hope your holidays were wonderful. We haven&#x27;t had the chance to
speak in a few weeks.
What are the difference in the 469 and the 470 besides 2 channel vs.
4? You are still choosing one channel and it is still a linear sweep
right? Technically, what would be the difference in choosing AM on the
469 and AM on the 470? The pulsing sound is absolutely annoying.

&gt; Had a pretty good session today, i&#x27;ve been pretty blocked with other 
&gt; boxes yet i seem to always get great results with the RS 12-470.  Some 
&gt; really good responses to my questions.  Hey babs, i think you should 
&gt; give the RS box a little time and maybe you will start to get stuff.  
&gt; Although i have a 12-469 also and it really sux compared to the 12-
&gt; 470.  The constant pulsing noise in the 469 model just drives me crazy 
&gt; enough to not concentrate.  Try looking for an older style model of the 
&gt; 12-470, that&#x27;s probably the best radio i own hands down.  Instant 
&gt; results always and consistently.  All my boxes work, but they are 
&gt; finicky sometimes.  No need to comment to my posted files guys, just 
&gt; listen and see if i&#x27;m on some sort of a right track with the 
&gt; communication.
