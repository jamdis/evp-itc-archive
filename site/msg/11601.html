<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Cool Becca. Sounded like you used the allophone file for the raw audio. Ive had some good results using Stefans evpmaker software.

&gt; I just posted part of a recording from yesterday (still
&gt; going through
&gt; all of them).  This was recorded at the farm I grew up on,
&gt; where my
&gt; brother and his family now live.  My two nieces (age 17 and
&gt; 21) have
&gt; had various occurrences there so we thought we&#x27;d try
&gt; out some of this
&gt; new stuff and see what we&#x27;d get.  We got quite a few
&gt; interesting
&gt; results I think.
&gt; 
&gt; This is part of one where we asked if they are there, and
&gt; then how
&gt; many are there. This one was made with EVPMaker (the RS
&gt; 20-125 didn&#x27;t
&gt; work so well out in the country - maybe not enough
&gt; noise/sounds for
&gt; them to use??)  The answer is &quot;We are at eight, Yeah,
&gt; there are
&gt; eight.&quot;  I think it&#x27;s pretty clear.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think?
