 The ones that move beyond this Earth level, don't talk anymore, except ma=
ybe the more enlightened ones that come back. My mother in-law used to talk=
 all the time, but one day another spirit said she got a new body and moved=
 up two steps, and that's last I heard of the mother in-law. More than just=
 a whisp of ecto-junk we are.

Once again I think it comes down to our expectations a=
gain. I think to many people expect a lot of these spirits to have some kin=
d of special insight or access to some grand knowledge. I think that the on=
ly difference between a lot of them and us are that they have transitioned =
beyond the physical and that is it. No matter how hard you try you cannot s=
hake the "earth" vibration and you will continue to contact those close to =
the "earth" vibration. In order to contact the higher beings by technical m=
eans we have to gain their interest and they have to come to us. We cannot =
transcend our level to go to them without accessing higher levels of consci=
ousness, which requires more than switching on a recorder.Best regards,Fran=
