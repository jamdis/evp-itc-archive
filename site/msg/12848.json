There would be stations on 1480 and 1490 \nin the USA, not necesssarily in your area, though. If you go to this page:\n\nhttp://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/amq.html\n\nEnter 1480 as the lower frequency and 1490 as the upper frequency and \nyou&#39;ll get a page listing all the stations on those two frequencies.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Wed, 19 Nov 2008, threadsintyme@... wrote:\n\n&gt; LOL...Same here! I *thought* that this sounded as if it were in the AM band.\n&gt; Glad I didn&#39;t ask if it was AM or FM or SSB! LOL hehe\n&gt; Man, I remember when I was a kid and would work DX on the 14 meter band. CW was my choice and really loved it. &lt;sigh, heavy, heart broken sigh&gt;\n&gt; That was back in the good ole daze of 1968...had more sick days at school that they kept up with!\n&gt; Al\n&gt;\n&gt; -- don powell &lt;dpowell7299@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; According to Wikipedia, 1485 Khz is in the AM band region.
