Just kidding, but listen to the 2 \nnew \n&gt; files from today in the folder and let me know what you guys think. \nI \n&gt; already know i have good communication with my two friends on the \nother \n&gt; side named Mike and Lisa, but i want to show others that what i get \nis \n&gt; real. If anybody wants to do a test session through Skype just e-\nmail \n&gt; me and we can set something up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanx,\n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                          \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private & \nconfidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is \naddressed to.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;   No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or \nforwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.\n&gt;"}
