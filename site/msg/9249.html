Hi All;  As I said before, I mistakenly supplied the 469 with 3 volts( in =
my head 3 betteries =3D3 volts-sleep deprived), instead of the 4.5 volts th=
at would normally come from the batteries(3 X 1.5). Well, that's pretty clo=
se to 5 volts, so I just tweaked the regulator up to five volts, and it(the=
 469) runs fine. So just a 78L05 will do to power the 469 on the sweep boar=
d. For those crazy enough to try this.   BTW, I guess I left the impression=
 I was desperate for funds, that's not the case, the only thing I really ne=
ed is time! I just don't have the time to make boxes non-stop. The Old' Lad=
y will let me buy whatever I truly need, and this month that will be circui=
t boards. I'm not going to to spend every spare penny on ghost boxes.   I m=
ake a few boxes for special cases, such as--since day one "they" have talke=
d about Chip Coffey, so he gets #34. Ann and Misty have been waiting years,=
 so I'm hoping to get thiers shipped this week.  I did do one of my super h=
acks for someone, but it was almost by intuition that I found it acceptable=
, they supplied the 469. I can't do that for many, again I just don't have =
the time. This is going to be a weird one, it'll do a regular hack function=
, or it can be swithed to normal box mode. BTW, all these boxes are going t=
o women, except for Coffey. Most of the boxes I've ever made were to test v=
arious ideas, then when I was done I just gave them away to who ever I coul=
d pawn them off on, now it's a different story. They even say to give Moon =
more boxes, so the demands even come from the spirits.  I'm hoping to set a=
side building by the end of the week so I can focus on a printed circuit bo=
ard design. I want like a universal sweep/amplifier board. This last one I =
made over the weekend took ten hours to wire by hand, I can eliminate that =
much labor by having some boards made, since the sweep, and amplifiers are =
pretty much the same from system to system.   Frank-S
