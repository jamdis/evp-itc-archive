You have been so generous in giving out directions and help but truth is people just dont follow your directions thus far.

If ya wanna donate the money ya make into something you could try getting those more expensive parts that you had wanted to try out but couldnt afford or making upgrades to one of your prototypes. The truth is it costs you to make them and that you should be compensated for your time and the $$ you put into construction.\n   \n  Misty\n   \n  \nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n          I tried to take her off the spam list, but couldn&#39;t remember my password.\n\nFrank\n\n&gt;From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] A link with Chris Moon\n&gt;Date: Mon, 8 Jan 2007 16:02:58 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;\n&gt;Cool Frank.
