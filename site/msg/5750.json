I had some chipping in my #30 box, and it was cuz \nthe last IF can wasn&#39;t grounded. \n\n The AM band was all noisy tonihgt, and I&#39;m asking out loud why, I got \na direct response for the box, &quot;it&#39;s snowing!&quot;. I checked a pocket AM \nradio and it was noisy as well, I didn&#39;t know snow put out static, but \nyou do get lightning in a snow strom sometimes.\n\n Frank-S"}
