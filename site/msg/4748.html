<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Okay--Now I feel better about what I am hearing out of my box. I get

&gt; Hey Ratka here is one of yours, seems they are still around. I  
&gt; decided since it came thru with the frank s stuff yesterday maybe I  
&gt; should post this one to group never know maybe Jacob keeps poppin  
&gt; up because they know someone around us. They are persistant to say  
&gt; the least. A few tried to hush them from speaking over others in my  
&gt; session.
