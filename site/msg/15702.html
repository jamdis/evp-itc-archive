<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank &amp; everyone on the List:
Your C2C interview was ho I finally tracked you down. I&#x27;d heard about your work over the years and seen a pitcure of your box.

I thought that you sounded grounded and you seemed to portray an air of, &quot;this is what was heard, make up your own minds&quot; .
What impressed me enough to share with my husband, was that the &#x27;messages&#x27; were clear and concise, not in the least open to copious amounts of interpretation.

I heard you reiterate that fact that you had the files for th public to listen to. But I think I fell asleep before they were played, or did they even get aired? 

The interview intrigued me enough to seek out this list and learn more. 

Did I sense a &quot;Doomsday&quot; feel to your end of things, not at all, but unfortunately I was a little disappointing by George Noory&#x27;s attitude which I sense to be a bit  &#x27;patronizing&#x27;. Something that I was quite surprised to  note. 

I was really looking forwards to hearing more supporting data.
So that is what an &quot;outsider&quot; perceived from your interview one I had been waiting to hear for some time.

Can anyone tell me how long was Helen Gurley Brown&#x27;s interview?  I know she is quite favoured guest on C2C.

Anyways, I am here to learn what I can...
Deb

&gt;  Well, our show time seems to have been cut short by what I think was
&gt; favoritism by Noory- Murphy and I were not allowed to present anything to
&gt; support what we were saying, and made to look like were doomsday crazy or
&gt; something. No more firggin&#x27; radio shows!
&gt; 
&gt;  Remember what I&#x27;ve said about self proclaimed experts in this field!
