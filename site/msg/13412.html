<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Greetings fellow researchers,

(Remember, what follows is opinion... so please be gentle)

Well, the new TruTV series, Door to the Dead aired last night. I 
recorded it with my DVR so I could watch and review the program video 
a bit better than just watching it live.
So... what did I think of Door to the Dead?
Let me say this... the first episode was more entertaining than Ghost 
Hunters, G.H.I., Paranormal State, and even that other one where the 
guy and his team get locked over night in places (I can&#x27;t think of 
the name right now). Note: I don&#x27;t watch any of them anymore, even 
though I did give them all a try at least once or twice.

Anyway, although I had some problem with the entity &#x27;orbs&#x27; portion of 
the Door to the Dead investigation, since I may have seen an &#x27;orb 
source&#x27; when I put the DVR in super slow motion, the rest of the 
series was put together nicely, with a good story line, good 
interaction of characters, and some very entertaining and interesting 
methods used for the variety of investigative tactics.

Unlike G.H., G.H.I., Paranormal State, and that other one, I&#x27;ll 
probably watch &#x27;Door to the Dead&#x27; again to see how it pans out. The 
new TruTV series caught my attention.
