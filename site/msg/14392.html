&gt; &gt; One last question before I got to bed after 1am :) What are those noises
&gt; often heard before or after an EVP? I have found quite a few voices that I
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t have noticed hadn&#x27;t I first heard a &quot;pop&quot; sound. Actually had to do
&gt; some MAJOR enhancing on 2 of them to even hear them at all. I mean one was
&gt; impossibly buried in the noise. But after slowing it down I got a &quot;wiff&quot; of
&gt; it, and through more passes of the Audacity effects I was rewarded with a
&gt; female voice. It was sad though...she said in a mechanical pattern &quot;can -
&gt; you - help- me.........please - help. Still, the audio is so painfully low.
&gt; Hearing her plea will forever effect me. Hopefully I can find someoneone
&gt; here that can hear them as well as I. That can verify this for me :) I hear
&gt; it...but is nice to know someone else is there with you :) I went back to
&gt; that location little over an hour later (after found the voice) Is under 1
&gt; mile from me. It&#x27;s a real sad thing to hear and not knowing what to do.Jim H
