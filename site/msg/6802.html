that fact that something talks that keeps me hooked.

&gt; Hi Frank,
&gt;  
&gt; It is nice to see you back here again.  And I love your screen  
name.  You 
&gt; are right when you say you can never force or coerce a spirit to  
communicate 
&gt; with.  For those that are able to communicate with them we do  feel 
extremely 
&gt; priviledged and honored that they have chosen to do so.   Even when 
there is no 
&gt; communication just listening and hearing what they have to  say is 
very 
&gt; amazing in itself.  What they say may not always be nice but  maybe 
they know more 
&gt; about us than we give them credit for?

&gt; I made one today, same as the last except I can adjust the sweep  
level, and 
&gt; where in the band the sweep starts, or do manual sweep. I used to  
put this 
&gt; function in the boxes, but no one used it, too busy asking stupid  
questions, or 
&gt; showing the world what great mediums they were cuz they had a  
box,  so I 
&gt; started leaving it out to save parts, and front panel  space. 
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t think you can force, or coerce spirit, I&#x27;ve  always thought 
it best 
&gt; just to allow. 
&gt; 
&gt; Curious--these  are for me a change, and they are flying together. 
Never 
&gt; before  have I made a board in 24 hours, it required only a slight 
shift in the  
&gt; concept.
