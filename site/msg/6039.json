I saw a show once with talking dogs, they said \na variety of things, one of them was even on a tv commercial saying I \nlove you\n&gt;    \n&gt;   They have vocal ability, they learn english, they have brains... \nso why not\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Lauras dog started barking during one of her ITC sessions and \nsome evp voices came out in that bark when we played it back. I said \nlook your dogs talkin LOL\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Our male chihuahua tries to vocalize, he tries to copy whatever \nyou are saying as long as you start with OOO OOO OOO hehehehe then \nwhatever comes after he will try to copy. He finally gives up and \njust starts barking loud all excited.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I know Brian Jones has some interest in what animals say, last I \nheard he was planning on researching into that more dunno if he stuck \nwith it.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           I have gotten our dead dogs on EVP, or through the box, \nbut today, as \n&gt; my wife an I were both downstairs, we didn&#39;t hear the doorbell as \nthe \n&gt; neighbor kid was ringing it, so being about 7, he just came on in. \nThe \n&gt; smallest Yorkie let out a loud bark, and I swear it said &quot;get outta \n&gt; here&quot;. I heard it as plan as any other speech. \n&gt; \n&gt; I know, anecdotal evidence. \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                          \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
