This was from the video tape interview \ndone Sunday.\n\n\n&gt;From: ---------------\n&gt;To: Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: Expectations\n&gt;Date: Tue, 3 Apr 2007 23:28:50 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi Frank,\n&gt;\n&gt;   The interview did go well. Sorry for any anxiety it may have caused but \n&gt;hopefully you are now comfortable with me. I am committed to honoring your \n&gt;intended purpose and today shared time with Mark Macy using your box and he \n&gt;is equally impressed. Mark only adheres to the research of contact with \n&gt;postive ethereal beings. You are considered by many to be an important \n&gt;pioneer in the field of ITC research.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Thank you for your time and trust. You have managed to break new ground \n&gt;and have joined the ranks of those that have made a real impact in \n&gt;facilitating communication with non physical intelligence.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Sincerely, Bill -----\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nInterest Rates Fall Again! $430,000 Mortgage for $1,399/mo - Calculate new \npayment \nhttp://www.lowermybills.com/lre/index.jsp?sourceid=lmb-9632-18679&moid=7581"}
