Oh don't EVEN get me started on the homeless thing...

Those "poor ghosts" =
in that prison were murderers, rapist, etc. They put themselves there. They=
 have the capacity to free themselves if they would realize it. In fact the=
y would probably learn something by doing it themselves, as opposed to gett=
ing it handed to them without working for it.

I wish them neither harm nor=
 foul, but I will not go out of my way to help any such soul.

  Isn't this kind of like a poor person o=

elves there, many disowned by family, lost of jobs, no education, lack of m=
otivation when they were children, a drunken family that was nothing but se=
lfish, didn't care about their own children, nor the future of the children=
.  These are ignored by strangers, and the community, look away, no one see=
s them so, they are don't exist.  Bums the lot of them!  Is this how it's t=
o be forever?  Poor ghosts of society, they should be helped in any way we =
can, prayer is like sending positive wishes, thoughts are things, negatives=
 bring more negatives, positive thoughts do help others.   And so nothing c=

      Yes, you need speical permi=
ssion. I was there for an all night ghost hunt as a guest of Eastern Parano=
rmal. The place can be rented at night but believe me when i say "it ain't =
cheap". Plus I don't think the prison would appreciate me releaseing the in=
mates before their eternal sentence has been served.
