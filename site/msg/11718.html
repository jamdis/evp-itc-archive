You were right. The 469 validated EVPs that I have captured in my
apartment. the name given was the same as on the EVP when I asked who
was here.

You are a wealth of information. Thank you.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; How do you guys have the 469 set up? I&#x27;ve hacked the radio, but do not
&gt; have a port into my sound card. Any suggestions of different
&gt; configurations that have worked well for you. I&#x27;m in Atlanta so we
&gt; have a lot of stations and I&#x27;m getting what seems like a lot of one
&gt; station or another when it scans. Do you find it necessary to mix the
&gt; raw audio with white noise?
