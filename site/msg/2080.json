I experienced this EVP at the \nVulture Mine in Arizona on March 31st of this year. I was alone in a \ndilapidated schoolhouse built in the 1880&#39;s awaiting my team members \nto come back from a lecture.\n\nI asked for two &quot;rappings&quot; on the wall if there was a presence was \nwith me. I was performing an EVP session just to kill time. What I \ngot was footsteps coming towards me on the wooden floor. My \nperception was way off from the reality of what happened. I \nbelievved they were &quot;rappings&quot; and what I got was footsteps.\n\nIs this is an EVP or some other type of event? Most EVP&#39;s are only \nheard on audio after you check your recorder and is in a range of \nsound that the human ear can&#39;t hear? Please listen to this EVP and \ngive me your opinion. \n\nJames"}
