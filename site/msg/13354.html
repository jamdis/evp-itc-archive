I have one of a handful=
 of the Edison Autobiography that has the last chapter with his thoughts on=
 the great beyond.=A0 His family had that version of the biography recalled=
 and reissued it without the last chapter.

Anyway in this last chapter, Ed=
ison alludes to a way to communicate with the dead but he never says he did=
 it.=A0 He simply hypothesizes on how it could be done and the fact that th=
e dead are just on a different wavelength than the living.

Sorry, no links=
...=A0 This is from that old fashioned thing called a book :))

I can tell =
you how to find your own copy though if you wish.=A0 I need to find the act=
ual page count
 from my copy but I went to amazon's used books and asked ev=
ery seller how many pages their copy was.=A0 The first one to respond with =
the correct (bigger) number, that was the one I
 bought.

Don

PS but don't=
 spend alot.=A0 The info in the last chapter is not worth much.

            I suppose =
ultimately, it doesn't really matter if Edison made a

telephone to the dea=
d or not.  Modern researchers in this field will

have to stand on their ow=
n results anyway, and if they've managed to

discover something that Edison=
 never achieved, good for them!



I have also heard varied claims: that Ed=
ison did make this box; that

Edison was working on it but never finished i=
t; that Edison was joking

when he mentioned working on it.  So for my own =
sake, I'd like to know

the real story.



If you have a link to where you =
got your information from his

assistants and staff, I would really like to=
 read it.  Please make

sure it is as close to the source material as possi=
ble, and not

someone quoting someone quoting an article.  For example, her=
e is a

link to the actual New York times article on Edison discussing his
=

views of life after death:  

http://query. nytimes.com/ mem/archive- free=
/pdf? _r=3D1&res=3D 9903EEDC1F39E333 A25751C0A9669D94 6196D6CF



That is t=
he kind of link I'd be hoping for regarding your statements.



Thanks for =
any info.
