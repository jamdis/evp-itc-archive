&gt; Frank--I don&#x27;t think you should do that. I think you need to 
address  
&gt; this with him face to face. We don&#x27;t need this turn into exactly 
what  
&gt; I jokeingly proposed it might become a month ago: The Tesla Gang 
v.  
&gt; the Edison Gang. (That&#x27;s kind of unappealingly like The Narwhals 
v.  
&gt; The Unicorns, isn&#x27;t it?)
&gt; 
&gt; Meet with him, be calm, and ask him to explain himself. Debate  
&gt; logically until you reach an understanding. You need to do this 
and  
&gt; so does he.

&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise to go unarmed. LOL!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At least mentally.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That&#x27;s the point, Moon seemingly gets valid stuff, at least
&gt; &gt; sometimes, but to say, and imply he is the only one allowed, in my
&gt; &gt; eyes, pretty much negates everything else and pisses me off.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I should have let this go, but I didn&#x27;t want to meet woht Mr 
Moon
&gt; &gt; completely unarmed.
