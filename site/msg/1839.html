<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello Frank and Everyone,

   I just uploaded a file from box 23L in a directory for AM Linear
Sweep. I&#x27;ve been working with Rosemary Ellen Guiley, Rick Fisher and a
few other individuals with an ongoing ITC project that started in May.
Rosemary brought Box 22 and Box 23L along last week. We let box 22 run
by itself in another room and took 23L to another area of the location
and attempted to ask a few questions. I am still listening to all of
the audio from these sessions, but the uploaded file was something we
all heard loud and clear from the box, so I was hoping to get some
impressions on it. 

Craig T</pre>
