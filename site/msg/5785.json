I listen to COast \nto Coast AM on it at night as I fall asleep and never tried the \nscan.

Well, i was cleaning up today and came across it.  I \n&gt; turned it on and just held down the scan button and it scans \nthrough \n&gt; all the stations non-stop as long as you keep it pressed down.  \nWhich \n&gt; is no big deal since the recorded sessions for me are only usually \n10 \n&gt; Min. tops. This model has been out for years and you can pick it up \n&gt; at your local Circuit city or Best buy, it&#39;s even on Ebay for $20.  \n&gt; Circuit city i think is like $30.  You have to plug headphones into \n&gt; it or an external speaker, but it fits in the palm of your hand and \n&gt; the reception is better than all the rest.  It runs off of 1 AAA \n&gt; battery and lasts forever.  For those who are afraid to hack a \nradio, \n&gt; just pick this model up and hold the scan button down and away you \ngo \n&gt; right out of the packaging.  I did open it up and there is a \nribbon, \n&gt; but nothing was clearly marked so i will have to find the \nschematics \n&gt; online before i mess with it.  The radio has AM/FM/WB/TV, however \n&gt; when i did the trial scans i found that the AM worked best and \n&gt; instantly received answers to my questions.  I turned it on and \nasked \n&gt; if this is working and loud and clear they said &quot;yes&quot;.  Oh, it&#39;s \n&gt; model # SRF-M37V.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll post more when the ideas hit me.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
