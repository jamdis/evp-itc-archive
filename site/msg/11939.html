<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Fascinating Zack. We&#x27;re just waves, eh? Waves of particles or streams?  
What are the particles? Do we really exist? lol!

&gt; Yes it is. To greatly simplify things, motions within motions in and

&gt; matter or mass.
&gt;
&gt; Condensed space becomes energy. Dispersed matter becomes energy.  
&gt; There are
&gt; many ways of accomplishing this.
&gt;
&gt; All that article is describing is the patterns. It doesn&#x27;t mention the
&gt; content or structure of the patterns.
&gt;
&gt; Also, the last sentence of the article is not completely true. I&#x27;m  
&gt; sure
&gt; Frank and a few others around who are radio amateurs or are familiar  
&gt; with
&gt; the phenomena of propagation know about things like sporadic-E  
&gt; clouds and
&gt; tropospheric ducting which enable signals in the FM spectrum (88 to  
&gt; 108
&gt; MHz) and even higher frequencies to propagate long distances. I made a
&gt; microwave radio contact over a 470 mile path on the frequency of 10368
&gt; MHz (microwave) with 2 watts and a small (20-inch) dish antenna a few
&gt; weeks ago. Something called &quot;knife-edge diffraction&quot; is also fun to  
&gt; play
&gt; with, where the radio signals can be made to diffract over the tops of
&gt; buildings and mountains for long-distance contacts. We&#x27;ve had lots  
&gt; of fun
&gt; with this over the tops of Chicago skyscrapers in the past, too.
