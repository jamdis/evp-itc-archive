<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>For me, the question is not whether sense will emerge: it will.  Just like when looking at the randomness clouds eventually will emerge pictures.

For me, the question is where is that sense coming from: inside me, my brain? Or some entity?  

My problem is that many of the results people post are ambiguous.  While they could be from spirits, I can not find anything about them that  rules out just the operator&#x27;s brain.

And so I try to listen to the specific claims people make about the box and what it can reveal. And I try to construct my experiments to see if I can rule out the brain, leaving the spirits.

Why is that so awful?

&gt;  Just try listening to the gibberish for awhile, see if sense emerges from
&gt; the chaos. When I tried my frist linear sweep system all I heard was
&gt; gibberish, then all the sudden I could hear them. I think the problem is all
&gt; you.

&gt; &gt;   Since all I hear is gibberish, and since interpreting such gibberish is
&gt; &gt; subjective, and can be influenced by telling people what they are supposed
&gt; &gt; to hear first, I would agree this kind of test is poor evidence.

&gt; &gt;  Nope, no evidencee, totally insignificant that a ghost box says &quot;ghost
&gt; &gt; box&quot;, must be anecdotal imaginary hallucinations caused by supplying oxygen
&gt; &gt; to a living brain stem. It must only count as evidence if the researcher has
&gt; &gt; multiple degrees in BSology--and I smile as I type that!
