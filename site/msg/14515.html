Exactly! That's what I'm sayin'.

Wouldn't it be a hoot if Frank himself bl=
asted the guy. But that isn't the mature way..... ;)

  Been following this unp=
rofessional idiot's items for awhile now. I love how he says that Frank cha=
rges thousands of dollars for an original Frank's box. 

  This dude is the=
 worst type of con, preying on people who know only enough to be familiar w=
ith the term Frank's box. Then again, it always has bothered me when people=
 take shack hacks and charge stupid prices for them on ebay under the Frank=
's box moniker.

  This guy is based out of Nevada I believe, and his group=
's ethics leave little to be desired. Takes all kinds, I reckon...
