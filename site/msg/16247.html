HI, A copper wire run outside for an antenna works great, my shop is metal =
and i cannot pick station only about a mile away, so i ran a 12 gauge insul=
ated wire about 125 feet long, i live in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area a=
nd can now receive stations from several states away.=A0 You can also conne=
ct to most Cable TV Systems=A0and receive many stations.

Thanks! We just moved--senior citizens and we just bought our first ho=

The house was made in '47, and I =

 It would also remove the requirement that discarnates manifest the phenome=
na. If discarnates are indeed non-physical, it is unclear how they would mo=
dify the physical world. On the other hand, we have good evidence demonstra=
ting the ability of living individuals to alter their environments in profo=
und ways, apparently with their minds. So it seems to make more sense that =
this might indeed by the underlying mechanism to EVPs rather than discarnat=
e manipulations.

 It would also remove the requirement that discarnates manifest the phenome=
na. If discarnates are indeed non-physical, it is unclear how they would mo=
dify the physical world. On the other hand, we have good evidence demonstra=
ting the ability of living individuals to alter their environments in profo=
