Before I gave it a\ntestrun, I made it clear I was only doing a test and that I did not\nintendto make any contact. About half way through the first sweep, I\nheardmy name. Very exciting and somewhat startling at the same time.\nHopefully Ican get time to do an actual session tonight. I understand\nit cantake some time for the box to get &quot;imprinted&quot; as Bruce says.\nThank you Steve for finding this hack and thanks to the others herefor\nyour endless help to everyone on the board.Jeremy\n&gt; \n&gt; The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private &\nconfidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is\naddressed to. \n&gt;  \n&gt; No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or\nforwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Helping your favorite cause is as easy as instant messaging.
