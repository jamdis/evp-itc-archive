Posted by: &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; lcdupla@ lcduplaDate: Wed Mar 12,\n&gt; 2008 1:16 pm ((PDT)) Frank S., thanks for uploading the files. Very\n&gt; interesting sounds and idea. Could definitely provide the means for\n&gt; very clear communication.  I am assuming that you are trying to\n&gt; produce random sounds and see if they can be manipulated into words,\n&gt; or do you have another idea on how they can choose the specific \nsounds\n&gt; necessary to create words, kinda&#39; like some cosmic typewriter? ;) \nLC&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  No, it&#39;s a comic typewritter! Just kidding. Yeah, I trying to see\n&gt; if I can radnomly access the chip, make it output speech bits and\n&gt; other sounds to be used as the raw audio for ghost voices. It&#39;s just\n&gt; the start of the project. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Connect and share in new ways with Windows Live.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; http://www.windowslive.com/share.html?\nocid=TXT_TAGHM_Wave2_sharelife_012008\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
