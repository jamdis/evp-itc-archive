<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s a very funny and clever story, but Bruce clearly said that 
jeff shouldn&#x27;t even be in the same atmosphere as him, let alone 
research.  I don&#x27;t feel that anybody is better than the other and 
post after post Bruce has stated and you can review to check if you 
want that he is the best researcher in the world...self appointed.  
And i think that it&#x27;s not true at all, i feel we are all trying to 
move this forward and guidance is good but we all should work 
together and not try to be better than one another.

&gt; I certainly respect and support the idea that none of us is a 
messiah
&gt; and none of us has all the answers, but that is not germane to the
&gt; issue here. This is about how to correctly and fairly moderate a 
list.
&gt; 
&gt; If this was the wild west, things would have transpired something 
like
&gt; this:
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce stood in the public street and offered a completely legitimate
&gt; exchange with the townsfolk.
&gt; 
&gt; Laura walked out of the saloon and took a shot at Bruce and at the
&gt; window of Frank S&#x27;s telegraph office.
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce shot back at Laura.
&gt; 
&gt; Johnny Marlboro stepped out onto the balcony of the Imperial hotel 
and
&gt; took a shot a Bruce.
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce shot back.
&gt; 
&gt; Laura pulled out a deputy&#x27;s badge, stuck it to her lapel, and shot
&gt; Bruce dead.
&gt; 
&gt; Ann ran out into the street and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t you think there&#x27;s a
&gt; problem here? Maybe the sheriff needs to step in,&quot; to which Laura,
&gt; acting under the color of law, replied that if Ann didn&#x27;t like it 
she
&gt; could leave town and if she stayed she better not question authority
&gt; again. 
&gt; 
&gt; That&#x27;s what happened here. That&#x27;s the issue.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m still standing here saying something is wrong. Shoot me.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; LC,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I understand where you are coming from in respect in speaking 
their 
&gt; &gt; opinion, however if i had to read yet another post of how great 
&gt; &gt; someone is when nobody is great in this i was going to be sick.  
&gt; &gt; Arrogance and ego is very bad and that kind of mentality is 
Cancer to 
&gt; &gt; this research, i can share my opinion with the group but never 
tell 
&gt; &gt; anybody what to do.  I sit idly by and watch 200+ people get bad 
&gt; &gt; information on a daily basis, which hurts any good research.  The 
&gt; &gt; best way to go about what we are doing is to come up with our own 
&gt; &gt; theories and post them as examples for others to read.  We 
shouldn&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; have anybody dictate every aspect of this as fact.  If anybody 
can 
&gt; &gt; give information on box use it would be Frank, who nobody who 
owns 
&gt; &gt; boxes has listened to...myself included.  He knows how they work 
and 
&gt; &gt; offers a great amount of knowledge to this subject or else none 
of us 
&gt; &gt; would even be here.  This board has started to be a dictatorship 
of 
&gt; &gt; one persons opinion and if nobody listened...they were wrong.  
And to 
&gt; &gt; me, that&#x27;s wrong.  I started out with Joe&#x27;s box and moved forward 
and 
&gt; &gt; nobody helped me in my path.  I since aquired other boxes and 
taught 
&gt; &gt; myself them as well, which means it can be done.  People...do 
your 
&gt; &gt; own thing and get results the best way you can and learn from 
your 
&gt; &gt; mistakes, that&#x27;s what i did.  And getting Bruce his first Joe&#x27;s 
box 
&gt; &gt; and Frank&#x27;s box and getting him started in box research, i 
somewhat 
&gt; &gt; feel responsible for what transpired on this board and i 
apologize to 
&gt; &gt; those involved.  Frank, i&#x27;m sorry that another person has taken 
your 
&gt; &gt; box and claimed to know all and not listening to what you adhere 
we 
&gt; &gt; do.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Nuff Said,

&gt; &gt; &gt; With all due respect, I am going to put my 2 bits in on this.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I love the sharing of info, but have elected to post less and

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; That said, I must agree with Ann that the initial post, though 
&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps posted to be humorous, came off as disrespectful (in my 
&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion as a reader looking in on this forum) not only to BH 
but to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; FS.  BH does get animated at times, but he also brings some 
good 
&gt; &gt; &gt; input in here, too. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; We need to learn how to get along and work together.  Look at 
your

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First off the reason I got a new box From Frank is because he 
&gt; &gt; &gt; recognises
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am a serious researcher, It does not have anything to do 
with 
&gt; &gt; &gt; being a man 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or woman. It has to do with being deserving of a Frank&#x27;s box 
and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; evidently!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well do I have to spell it out? Start putting some time into 
your 
&gt; &gt; &gt; research
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taking tantrums and maybe someday you&#x27;ll have a Frank&#x27;s box, 
But 
&gt; &gt; I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; doubt it!
