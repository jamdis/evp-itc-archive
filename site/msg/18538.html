Here is a short file, where someone says, "Scamp, Scamp," then Scamp barks. 
 "yap."  This little dog belonged to my grandma, when I was about 9 or 10  
years old, he was a Manchester Terrier, and lived with us for many years, 
and  this is his bark for sure.  I'd know that bark anywhere.  Sorry, that  I 
can't make it any clearer, I need to get one of those better ghost boxes I  
guess.  RJ, spirits are just like us, they are not omnipresent like  God,  
probably why David doesn't want to play the guessing game, he  has better 
things to do over there, and has said, they have thousands of people  standing 
in this long line waiting to get into the Heavens, and He can't just  drop 
His job and go to your house to see what you have over there, He did tell  me 
that first time what it was, and i sent it to you, but it was too late.   
It's hard for me to understand them sometimes, He was also right about that  
little boy, Syler being killed, and where his body would be found, I don't 
know  what they did about it though. sf
