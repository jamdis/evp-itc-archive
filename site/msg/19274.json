No two people hear this stuff the same, and there is no one out there that has the one valid version of any given voice. People hear EVP different just like they hear music different. It gives some validiation when more than one person hears a voice the same, but mostly that is rare. Even minutes later I hear &quot;why bother numbnuts&quot;, or &quot;you&#39;re the father numbnuts&quot;. I bet it don&#39;t say anythin&#39;!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Waste of time--??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
