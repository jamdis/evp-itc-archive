Here is an awesome ghost hunting event at this historic location.

 

Join Ursula Kalin and Nitey-Nite Ghost Tours for an amazing event at the Geneva Mansion in Geneva, IL. . It will be the Frank Box Extravaganza where we will demonstrate the famous authentic Frank Box,  made exclusively by Frank Sumption.  In addition,  other pioneer Ghost Box creations will be introduced including boxex created by Steve Hultay&#x27;s (Steve&#x27;s Box) ; Joe Cioppi&#x27;s (Joe&#x27;s Box);  Richard B Georgina&#x27;s (Rich Box); and the  (Chris Box) which is now obsolete. Other devices include the Paranormal systems mini box as well as a hack version of the Frank Box. Who knows maybe one you your loved ones will come through that night!

This workshop only will go from 9:00 pm - 5:00 am.

  Nestled on 8 wooded acres sits a magnificent 1902 estate, once home to a wealthy business man and his family.  Tragedy visited the residents of this grand old mansion and now, visitors have since reported strange, unexplainable experiences, as well as eerie sightings and disembodied voices !  Audible sounds of someone chopping wood outside, a shadow of a child playing peek-a-boo with guests,light anomalies caught on film,footsteps entering a room, and doors being opened on their own....these are some of the documented experiences had by both visitors, and professional paranormal investigators of the
Geneva Mansion</pre>
