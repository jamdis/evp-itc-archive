One is an early \nforeign language method voice I got using German, I think it waw back \nin 2002. There there&#39;s a couple ET type voices I got early on with one \nof the first boxes. These older voices seem clearer to me, and I don&#39;t \nknow if it&#39;s the boxes, or radio conditions, as it was at the tail end \nof Sun Spot cycle 23. I want to be ready for the next cycle, that could \nstart anytime now. \n\n Frank-S"}
