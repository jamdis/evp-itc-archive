hes not stopping Adrienne I believe just won't be on here...like that. Hes =
looking for people that respect him and not talk down to him about what he =
has basically created. He'll be fine.

Well, for one thing, I don't own the group anymore. Due=
 to one of these incessent argurments, I had to back away from this some ye=
ars ago as I almost got fired becuase yet someone else that thought they kn=
ew so much more forwarded all my e-mails to my boss. 

Then someone else se=
emed to be insinuating that I may have tampered with the imgaes. Very insul=
ting. This stuff goes on an on, regardless of the quality of voices, or the=
 images. I have reached my saturation point. There seems to be nothing more=
 to be gained by presenting anything else. Now, I can sympatize with Richar=
d Roberts!

The group will continue, as there are a number of box and paran=
ormal experts here that are more than happy to tell everyone what this stuf=
f really is and how it works. 

I didn't mean to create bad any feelings.
