You don't need all the parts I use, there's nothing set in stone, and I of=
ten vary the components, depending on what I have. The easiest way at this =
time is make the linear sweep circuit, and use it to tune the 12-469. For a=
 minimum system, that's all it would take, record directly from the headpho=
ne jack. On mine I mix the stereo head phone signals together cuz I don't l=
ike leaving one floating, or worse shorting it to ground. I also like to go=
 through a buffer amp so as not to load own the tuner, but you can do witho=
ut that stage. I like to use the sound chamber, but you can leave off the a=
mps for that as well, using it in direct mode. I rarely bother with the ran=
dom mode anymore, it doesn't work as well as linear, I don't care what Moon=
 says! and I never can get it to work cinsistently. 
 
 Tuning the 469 exte=
rnally gets rid of the clicking, and makes the voices not so chopped up. "T=
hey" seem to really like the FM on the 469. You could also just supply a ma=
nual tuning volatge to the 469 via a pot, and 9 volt battery.
