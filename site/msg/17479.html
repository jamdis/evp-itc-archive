<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I recall a book from years ago, something like &quot;When Fire  Doesn&#x27;t Burn&quot;. We seem to have the ability to change our perceptions and /or reality and create the conditions where fire doesn&#x27;t burn the body. It&#x27;s been way to long for me to have anything but a vague memory of the book. I think the quantum states of matter do manifest on the marco level, and can be effected by thought--yeah I know, where&#x27;s the proof.

&gt; Thanks for the pointer - it sounds interesting.
&gt; 
&gt; My understanding of this idea is that there are weird things along those lines that happen with individual atoms and below that level.  But this does not apply (has never been observed) in normal life.  For instance, all the quantum theories or disbelief in the world is not going to save us  if we lie down in traffic.  :)

&gt;       Frank did have a point there. There is some schools of thought that suggest that nothuing existis outside of ourselves, that we perceive and create our own realities. Things exist because we believe they do, calling them into reality. If you have ever watched the movie/documentary &#x27;What the Bleep Do We Know?&quot; it explains this in detail using scientific principals.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure how much of it I agree with, but there is some truth to the thought that we create our own realities.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have not seen this movie, I can recommend it. Even of you don&#x27;t agree with all of it, it does give you some interesting food for thought.

&gt;  I was just kidding, but personally I don&#x27;t think there is a fixed, fundamental reality. Just like the wave/particle, it&#x27;s whatever one thinks it is at that moment, for that person/test. 
&gt;  When the they aim Hubble at a blank spot in space, and give it a long exposure, revealing billions of new galaxies--did those galaxies always exist, or did science wish them to exist-er theorize they exist? and who can prove either way? Quantum &quot;science&quot; sugggests that everytime anyone on the planet/universe has a discision to make an new universe is instantly created to accommodate both, kinda negates the speed of light speed limit wouldn&#x27;t it, not to mention every other law of physics. 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt;  Yeah, I just don&#x27;t see science being of much help with anything.

&gt; Light is both a particle and a wave, depending on what you&#x27;re looking for, or how you measure it.  That goes for everything on the electro-magnetic (EM) spectrum, of which light is part, but gravity is not.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; According to current science, there are 4 fundamental forces in the universe: EM is one, and gravity is another (and then the others I think are strong and weak forces at the atomic level).

&gt; No gravity-particle has been discovered (graviton?). But there are theories about gravity being a particle, or a bend in space-time, or a wave, or a lot of things.  Science is still grappling with this.

&gt; Yes; if it happened now it would be visible 500 years from now. If it happened 500 years ago, it would be visible now.
&gt;  
&gt; However, there are people including Greg Hodowanec who have collected some evidence that gravity waves are near instantaneous, and that if a supernova occurred now, it could be detected now. Still, we wouldn&#x27;t SEE it for 500 years. And the equipment described by Hodowanec (which I&#x27;ve built) can&#x27;t tell us WHERE the supernova occurred, just the fact it did.

&gt; Fiona,
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to butt in, but I&#x27;m curious. If this is happening 500 Light Years away from us, doesn&#x27;t that mean it will be visible to us in 500 years? I know that there is a delay with sound such as thunder, then the delay before an individual hears it depending on how far they are from where the sound originated. Wouldn&#x27;t it be the same with light?

&gt; &gt; Hi,

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Frank, you mentioned June 17th and 22nd... I&#x27;ll be watching the PEAR project (RNG anomalies) anyway, but I think I&#x27;ve found what they&#x27;re talking to you about:
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; Yes, that could be the biggest &amp; best lightshow, ever. Get your lawn chairs ready!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Got anything for June 17th, or 22nd?
