Right under the 24 Nov 2007 date \n&gt; event.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/10/move-over-franks-box-radio-\n&gt; shack-hack.html\n&gt; \n&gt; By-the-way:\n&gt; I&#39;ve got the new version of the 12-470 (black case) torn apart on \nmy \n&gt; bench again.  I know I failed to get it hacked the first time (last \n&gt; year), but I figured I&#39;d try it again.  It is totally different \nthan \n&gt; the others... and they have made sure you can&#39;t tell what the radio \n&gt; chip is by getting rid of the markings and covering both sides of \nthe \n&gt; circuit board with a waxy substance. I&#39;ve been carefully scraping \nit \n&gt; away. The chip is a 30 pin device, possibly a KK22425 or KK22426 or \n&gt; equivilent.\n&gt; The mute pin for the #25 is pin 2 but looking at the connection \n&gt; scheme itmight not be the right one.\n&gt; I guess I&#39;ll mess with it until I break it... or ???\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll put some pictures of the new 12-470 circuit board in my photo \n&gt; area of this froum.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mike,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You forgot to mention that i was the first to do the hack after \n&gt; Bill \n&gt; &gt; and post files that same day.  I also stumbled across 3 other RS \n&gt; &gt; radios that i hacked (12-820, 20-125, 12-150) to share with other \n&gt; &gt; researchers.  A mention would have been nice in your blog, but \nyou \n&gt; &gt; contribute a lot of time too and we all appreciate it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Last night on Haunted Times Magazine radio , guest Brian \nHarnois \n&gt; &gt; (Ghost\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hunters International) told the radio listening audience that \nhe \n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think anyone should use a Franks&#39; Box, (or a ghost box is what \nhe \n&gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; insinuating) unless they had training from Christopher Moon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So... that is the topic of my blog write-up this morning if you \n&gt; &gt; care to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; read it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/10/ghost-box-is-training-\n&gt; &gt; required.h&#92;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tml\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/10/ghost-box-is-training-\n&gt; &gt; required.&#92;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; html&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com \n&lt;http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks....
