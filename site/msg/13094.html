I really do like that idea of mapping out areas and then having=
 the investigators rotate say after 40 minutes or so making sure that no on=
e divulges information about their findings. What we are looking for is for=
 corrolations or repeat exeriences... BTW what group are you with?

YES!

We have had cell phones set off ou=

What made me ban the use of two way radios was when I noticed=
 that they were causing interference on the DVRs..
they also cause humming =

For la=
