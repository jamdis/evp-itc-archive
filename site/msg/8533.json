The project is to learn whatever is to be learned from the other side about Autism between now and this time next month.\n   \n  Let me explain.  In the U.S. today one out of 150 children develops autism by the age of three years old.  For male babies it is 1 out of just 95 births.  This is a staggering number and it is getting worse.  \n   \n  The exact cause of autism is not known.  Some research indicates this abnormality in brain functioning is linked to heredity and genetic problems.  Other reports point to environmental issues such as absorption of heavy metals, and still others blame childhood vaccinations or nutritional deficiencies.  No one really knows for certain what triggers the disease. \n   \n  What I am asking fellow EVP researchers to do is include questions about Autism in their research for the next few weeks.  It would be wonderful if in our research we would include questions of your own choosing that are directed towards this subject.  If anything in your recorded session relates to autism you can then post the session with this Yahoo group and, if you care to, with the special Yahoo group I set up just for this research question.    \n   \n  The special Yahoo Group that I established for this research is EVP-AUTISM-QUESTIONS where everyone is invited to post relevant recordings. To do so, simply go into Yahoo Groups, search for this group name and join, just as you did when your joined here.  If you have a problem finding the site, let me know and I can send you an email invitation. \n   \n  My plan is to review all responses posted with our group here and in the new autism site.  On the other end of this research, I will be inviting persons who are involved with this disease to check into the new site and listen to any results that get published there.  Hopefully, this will be where the autism researchers will be exposed to the work of our EVP  researchers.   \n   \n  Please understand, I am not a doctor and I have no financial stake in autism research.  I am just a man with hopes that something very positive might come from our EVP research efforts that would benefit many, many children.  Admittedly, I will not know if any answer or communications that our group records and posts will contribute anything of value to the massive amount of research that is now being done for this disease.  It is for this reason that I will simply be posting your research results and then let the invited professionals in the medical field to review the information.  They will determine value.  \n   \n  The way I see it, if only ONE usable bit of information is made known, reinforced or otherwise brought to light by an EVP researcher, then all our efforts are worth it.  If nothing is learned...other than that we didn&#39;t learn anything...we still will have gained in knowing we tried...that&#39;s what research is about, no?    \n   \n  There are many sites on the web that you can check out to learn about Autism.  Here are just a few  http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/autism/overview.html     \n                http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndexZid=4407825       \n                www.autism-society.org\n                www.autism.com\n   \n  Any questions or comments can be directed to me in this yahoo group or sent directly to my email address at ronriko@....    \n   \n  If you belong to other EVP research groups you are welcomed to invite them to join us in this research.   Thank you for any support you give towards this project and good luck.    Ron L\n   \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nNo Cost - Get a month of Blockbuster Total Access now.
