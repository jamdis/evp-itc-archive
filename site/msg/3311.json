I had asked to talk to my dad and said, &quot;Are you here with \nme, Daddy?&quot;  I heard nothing over headphones while recording, but on \nplayback a very clear, loud voice says, &quot;Here.&quot;\nHere&#39;s the weird part:  The voice sounds not only like a female voice, \nbut like MY voice.  The voice comes in while I&#39;m still forming the end \nof my question, so my thought is: &quot;Do the entities sometimes use \nfragments of our own speech--our own questions during taping--to form \ntheir answers?  If you want to listen to the recording to see what I \nmean, let me know and I&#39;ll send it to anyone who wants it.  I \nappreciate any analysis and feedback.\nUrsula"}
