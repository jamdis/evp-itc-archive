A flame is used as the &#39;vibrating element&#39;. A phototransistor from Radio Shack is used in place of a microphone. Of all the tests I ran, a simple oil burning lamp has worked best. The lamp must have a flat, wide wick 3/4 to one inch across (very important). The phototransistor will function with the phantom voltage supplied from most digital recorders or sound cards. Very simple concept, most people who see it are amazed at the simplicity. You will not find plans on the internet except on AAEVP, I published an article almost two years ago for thier news letter. Since that time I have simplified the design to the two parts I have mentioned.\n\nDave\n\n--- franks-boxes@... wrote:\n\nFrom: &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] Optical mic info.\nDate: Thu, 05 Apr 2007 08:07:04 -0600\n\nThe only questin is how to build one, how to make one?
