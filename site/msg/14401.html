I'm not sure that is a good rule of thumb.=A0=A0 It would depend on what yo=
ur cleanup 'settings' are.=A0 For example, if you have them turned up all t=
he way (max cleaning, in whatever context that means), that would be one cl=
eaning, but a whole LOT of modification to the original recording. On the o=
ther hand, if you have them set very low, and did 3 cleanings, that might n=
ot even add up to the one big cleaning.

So I agree you have to be careful =
on how much you clean, but the number of times you run the source through y=
our filters or processors isn't sufficient to decide if you've over process=
ed it: it is the settings, and the specific processors or programs, and the=
 kind of cleaning, and even the nature of the original signal, that would b=
e needed to decide if it was over processed.

So the safe thing is not to p=
rocess at all.=A0 :-)
