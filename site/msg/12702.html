<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>A Faraday cage is supposed to stop all electromagnetic fields from 
entering it. They are useful in aligning equipment when you don&#x27;t want 
any external RF present.

You&#x27;re right; in a Faraday cage you would not be able to hear any radio 
stations. Frank&#x27;s box probably wouldn&#x27;t work as expected in a Faraday 
cage.

&gt; Mike didn&#x27;t cover the reasoning behind the Faraday Box in his YOUTUBE 
&gt; video...is it to prevent unwanted signals to come through? Seems like 
&gt; the Faraday Box could be self defeating...IE, if you are expecting 
&gt; radios signals to &quot;come through&quot;, how can they?
&gt; Again, this leads back to the questioning whether it is the signals or 
&gt; the noise and the effects that spirits use to communicate with? IF 
&gt; spirits are using EVP&#x27;s to communicate! I am still open to the 
&gt; possibility that spirits are. Doesn&#x27;t mean the spirits ARE...LOL.

&gt; This would seem to illustrate the divergence between schools of
&gt; thought with traditional evp and itc/rtsc. While using a faraday cage
&gt; to to prevent spurious and unwanted RF signals from contaminating a
&gt; microphone would be helpful for traditional evp, would it not be
&gt; counterproductive for box type ITC/RTSC? I am not trying to be
&gt; sarcastic or anything, I am just wondering if the idea here is to
&gt; ensure that if anything did make it through that it would most likely
&gt; be genuine? I would be afraid that the RF shielding would be too
&gt; effective thus blocking communication with a linear sweep box. If you
&gt; did get communication from a box in a faraday cage, it would certainly
&gt; make the skeptics and cynics be forced to present new arguments.

&gt;&gt; While reading a book about spirit communication, there was a chapter
&gt;&gt; which referenced the Faraday Cage. So... after reading it I decided to
&gt;&gt; try out what the book suggested and placed my Radio Shack Hack 12-470
&gt;&gt; Ghost Box into my microwave oven (in the OFF position) and ran a sweep
&gt;&gt; in the AM and FM mode.
&gt;&gt; The AM mode did receive much less but a few audio snippets did make
&gt;&gt; their way through. The FM mode was a different story. No frequencies
&gt;&gt; at all made it through... just white noise as each FM frequency was
&gt;&gt; reached during the sweep.
&gt;&gt; As I always do... I made a short video of both modes being sweeped.
&gt;&gt; You can see it, here:
