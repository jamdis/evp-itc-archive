I love the ones from casemate11 - I want to compare and see if this voice =
is similar/the same to the voices we have captured there. The sentiments ex=
pressed are definitely the same!

I will give a short explaination of what and w=

 a medium or pyschic.  She can read people and has proven to me that she ca=

THe only voice on this segment from the living was her's saying "is th=

pleas=

Attach it to your post like you would attach a file to an=
 email. But I think you have to do it via email, and not directly to the bo=
ard.

Hello everyone I am a member of Peace of Mind Paranor=
mal Society here in Pittsburgh, PA

lin. I made a Radio-shak hack with directions from UFOgeek's videos. This w=
as our first attepmt with it. How or where would i upload the wav file for =
you guys to take a listen.

I am having a hard time getting some of our mor=
e skeptical members to buy into the ITC-EVP ghost box stuff. I am convinced=
 with everything i seen and read about Frank and all his work to what i saw=
 on Youtube etc...

please respond
