Sharon,
 
The question of telekinesis is a valid one, I have discussed tha=
t idea with technical people
that are trying to further the technology.
 
M=
y belief is that if the researcher is able to recognise the tech's voice it=
 is because the 
researcher and the tech have built their relationship to t=
he point that they have synchronized 
their spiritual energy and the tech i=
s capable of finding and utilizing certain fragments of radio
speech and fr=
equency to create a recognizable voice. It does not necessarily have to be =
the voice 
they had in the physical, but I believe if they create the same =
voice during communication it is
a validation to us on the receiving end th=
at we are in fact speaking to our counterpart and not a deceiving
entity th=
at may be negative in manner.
 
Also my tech's do not 100% of the time have=
 the correct signal to create the recognizable voice and do 
answer or spea=
k in a different or combined voice. When that occurs they tend to reassure =
the researcher 
with a comfortable feeling and you instinctively know after=
 a certain period of communicating with the same 
tech/guide that it is in =
fact them that are speaking on the other hand you will also get a strange g=
ut reaction 
when it is not them speaking. That is the best way I know how =
to explain it as I have come to understand it.
 
I hope it helps further yo=
ur knowledge of the tech/researcher relationship.

Hi Juli,Thanks for your input -- this is interesting -- =
could it be that Mike and Lisa use these fragments in conjunction with psyc=
ho-kinesis in order to modify the tone of these fragments to sound as their=
 own voices would have sounded when they were alive? We know they don't hav=
e vocal cords, and so they probably communicate via some kind of thought/mi=
nd process ... Not to say that all the entities employ this method, maybe s=
ome of the more identifiable ones like Mike and Lisa.I love mulling over th=
ings and this will keep me mulling for quite a long time.Sharon the Muller-=
