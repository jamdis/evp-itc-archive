THIS is very encouraging.  It sounds like the real deal.\nThis was heard on windows media player--I suspect that the different players have different filtering characteristics, so that might be a BIG reason why some people hear things others dont.  I didnt hear the other two voices at all until I opened the file in Media player this morning."}
