<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>i just got my first clear voice on a digital recorder  a cheap 
chinese one from the drugstore.  the more times i played it the 
clearer it got UNTIL  i turned the recorder off prior to transferring 
to computer.  probably whatever biases the flash memory isnt quite up 
to what it should be.

on 1n34 &quot;conditioned&quot; diode; this is one of many things i use to test 
for extremely low level non-randomness in noise floor.

ordinarily, i am literally bedevilled by &quot;angels&quot; trying to speak 
into receiver.  gradually i am establishing that a principle 
called &quot;giant negentropy&quot; may be partly due to the efforts of living 
or once living entities from multiple &quot;elsewheres&quot; trying to cohere 
or phase-align noise --which is basically what all life does anyway, 
we increase the sun&#x27;s entropy and temporarily reverse our local 
entropy.

duh

in english:

life, including life that we cant presently comprehend , like trevor 
constable&#x27;s  sky creatures or the &quot;rods&quot;  or remnant cast-off shells 
of human souls may be hard wired to alter its environment thereby 
having a microscopic modulating effect on the local physical laws and 
constants.

it only SOUNDS  esoteric; you already know it.


i can make some extra 1n34 diodes for unusual recording opportunities 
i expect first week of april but i need an address to send them to.

i run a bunch of yahoo groups of my own and i know that it 
isnthealthy to start sending home addresses back and forth so maybe 
one brave foolcan volunteer.

&gt; LOL!!  Misty, I didn&#x27;t want to be the one to say it, but I feel the 
same way!!  : )
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds so intriguing, but I really don&#x27;t understand it!  My 
husband is an electrician.  Maybe he&#x27;d understand?
&gt; 
&gt; I am someone who is very interested in EVP, but got bored using a 
digital recorder and just recording voices.  I wanted more than 
that.  I think you guys understand that.  I want to know everything 
about it.  I want to experiment.  When someone mentioned this board 
and I checked it out, I loved what I was reading about all of the 
experimenting and I hope to get involved in it!

&gt;   Thats kind of you to offer Bill =) Id say me, but I&#x27;d need a 
video instruction book to go with it LOL with you going you put this 
thingy into that thingamajigger. Is there welding involved? (I dont 
do it)
&gt; 
&gt;   I KNEW I should have played with the older boys building radios 
when I was in school. But I was way too shy then and only in grade 
school so I did crafts with the older girls. Advanced classes were 
interesting but my shyness didnt help. So for the technically 
challenged (like me) perhaps you could lay out a mock instruction 
plan with a pic or two?
&gt; 
&gt;   I know quite a few on the group dont need it, and probably 
understand what you are saying completely.

&gt;     thanks for taking the trouble to look, Bill.
&gt; 
&gt;     i have a yahoo messenger webcam set up for members of franks-
evp only 
&gt;     for better explanatios/demonstrations. if anyone wants an evp 
&gt;     competent (or wtf) 1n34 to plug into their tape machine AND is 
a 
&gt;     member of this group only , i&#x27;ll send them out as long as i can 
&gt;     afford it/can spare time. worth the effort IMO for patient 
detail 
&gt;     conscious researchers which evp-ers seem to be. the described 
&gt;     procedure should work on first or second try for those that can 
put 
&gt;     together crystal receiver and plug it into amplifier.--with 
smal cap 
&gt;     to ground plug, you could even do it with a tape recorder. all 
long 
&gt;     wires that can act as antennas can then be removed and only 
diode or 
&gt;     diode and tuned circuit employed. whole assembly can be rotated 
to 
&gt;     block out radio stations.

circuit 
&gt;     tuned 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; to strong local station.
&gt;     &gt; &gt; 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; when match was two thirds burned, white noise started. 
match was 
&gt;     put 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; out. 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; now there is a steady 20mv* across input with diode in 
place. 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; previously 0 mv. no difference when diode is reversed.. 
diode 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; removed, v drops to zero. formerly strong local station was 
&gt;     barely 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; audible with good audio amp. now it is at normal listening 
&gt;     volume. 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; diode is noisy, but beneath what you can hear when tuned to 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; station. &quot;lumpy&quot; white noise; white noise with larger scale 
&gt;     order 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; appearing and vanishing- unpredictably , like candle flame- 
but 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; averaging about 3-15 times per second
&gt;     &gt; &gt; 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; other am receivers still full of crashing static from long 
gone t-
&gt;     &gt; &gt; storm.
&gt;     &gt; &gt; 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; tank circuit +diode + audio amp= no lightning crashes 
&gt;     whatsoever. no 
&gt;     &gt; &gt; line noise. no fluorescent light 60hz buzz.
