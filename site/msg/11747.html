<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;d hook the 469 to a speaker then hook the mic to the recorder and
place it to where it can pick up both your voice asking the questions
and the noise from the speaker. I&#x27;m sure there is a more complicated
way to do it though.

&gt; What&#x27;s up guys? I need a little help here. I have the 469 hack, as
&gt; well as an Olympus WS-110 digital recorder, and a mic. I am trying to
&gt; configure my system to allow me to record not only my voice, but the
&gt; hack at the same time. I ran a y-adapter from the mic input on the
&gt; Olympus to the 469 as well as a mic. Now when I record, the mic does
&gt; not record, only the 469. The mic acts as a speaker. What am I doing
&gt; wrong here? I don&#x27;t have an audio input on my laptop, just a built in
&gt; mic. Any suggestions?
