<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve been seeing a lot of foxes out in the country around here this year.
They don&#x27;t get too close to me, though. Also, I&#x27;ve never seen as many
coyotes as we have around this year.

&gt;  Come in this morning and there&#x27;s a Fox, I pull in the parking spot and she
&gt; just sits downs and looks at looks at me. For me, the fox and wolf are totem
&gt; animals, and last time I saw the wolf/fox the was a huge Earthquake in
&gt; Afghanistan. But.. as usual what do I know-- with all the paranormal masters
&gt; and experts out there, I&#x27;m sure they can explain this away.
&gt;
&gt; Hummmm, beginning to understand why........
