It works great.  The \nclick-click-clicking is unique to the new version of the 12-469&#39;s.  The other models don&#39;t \nmake this sound.  \n\nI like Frank&#39;s take on the 66 being meaningful as it is part of your screen name / email \naddy.\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;geekgurl66&quot; &lt;geekgurl66@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello All, \n&gt; Long time lurker here, got a question.\n&gt; I got the radio shack rs 469, did the hack and was having a tough time\n&gt; finding a speaker like the UFO geek uses for his box. I found a\n&gt; battery powered unit and now am experiencing the clicking sounds. Can\n&gt; anyone tell me where to find the small single speaker that was shown\n&gt; in the UFO Geeks hack? I think the batteries are causing the clicking.\n&gt; Oh also. I attempted to use the radio in a very active cemetary and\n&gt; the radio immediately locked on the am station 66. There was no sounds\n&gt; coming from it and each time I set it to search it would go back and\n&gt; lock. Did I have a hit from the other side and was too green to see that?\n&gt; Thanks for any and all input, would love to get this equipment going\n&gt; in the right direction as I keep getting signs of visitations and I\n&gt; feel as if I is my grandma trying to communicate with me.\n&gt; thanks,\n&gt; Michelle\n&gt;"}
