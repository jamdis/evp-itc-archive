<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I suppose ultimately, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if Edison made a
telephone to the dead or not.  Modern researchers in this field will
have to stand on their own results anyway, and if they&#x27;ve managed to
discover something that Edison never achieved, good for them!

I have also heard varied claims: that Edison did make this box; that
Edison was working on it but never finished it; that Edison was joking
when he mentioned working on it.  So for my own sake, I&#x27;d like to know
the real story.

If you have a link to where you got your information from his
assistants and staff, I would really like to read it.  Please make
sure it is as close to the source material as possible, and not
someone quoting someone quoting an article.  For example, here is a
link to the actual New York times article on Edison discussing his
views of life after death:  
http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9903EEDC1F39E333A25751C0A9669D946196D6CF

That is the kind of link I&#x27;d be hoping for regarding your statements.

Thanks for any info.

believe this type of hype!! 
&gt; &quot;John is joined in his mission by Chris Moon, an expert in all
things paranormal and possessor of Thomas Edison&#x27;s mysterious
`telephone to the dead&#x27;&quot; 
&gt; The only problem with this hype is that there is no and probably was
never a telephone to the dead. That is according to the members of
Edison&#x27;s own staff of assistants.
