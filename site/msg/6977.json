It sounds roughly like &quot;gong she fa sigh&quot;.  I&#39;m \npretty impressed.  He got all but the last syllable.  This is comparable \nto an experiment I just did with my husband, asking him to repeat that \nto me.  He got all but the last syllable, too.\n\n\nNellie\n\r\n--------------060903050400050901020203\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg;\n name=&quot;RS469 2-7-08 Happy new year.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: inline;\n filename=&quot;RS469 2-7-08 Happy new year.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------060903050400050901020203--"}
