Steven, I believe you and Frank could take this to an attorney,  and sue 
t=
he bums, freedom of speech is one thing, but to try an ruin someone's  
rep=
utation is another. You may just have a case here. Good luck.  sf

A  show that i had no knowledge of berading me and frank for a=
n hour. At 
least  they could have had us on to defend ourselves. Not knowi=
ng what we do 
at all,  most of what they said is based on conjecture and 1=
00% false.

Listen  for yourself and see. David Rountree is a huge piece of=
 crap and 
adds nothing  to any field or life for that matter. If you see a=
 picture of 
him, you would  want to punch him repeatedly.....at least that=
's how i feel.

Dr. Rorke  i thought was a good guy, but he's no better tha=
n the other  
skepdickheads.
