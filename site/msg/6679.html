I have been having weird sessions with Frank's Box #27, but in a good  way.  
They told me to change the antenna, which it did and the random  started 
working and never has on this box.  They told me tonight to put the  old antenna 
back on and the sessions keep getting better and better.  I  dragged Juli and 
Joel in on what i believed and felt was going to be a great box  session and 
here is a file only a couple minutes in to our hour long  session.  This is a bit 
rough sounding, but hearing it live is pretty clear  and you can hear me 
respond and than Joel agrees that he heard it too.  My  sessions are pretty 
incredible since the random mode started working on the  FB#27 and i feel the random 
is the best thing out there...hands down.  I  have done Sessions on the 
internet through Skype all week and i feel the energy  between Juli and I are 
really bringing them through clearly.  I only use  FB#27 now in random mode and it 
is the best feature on any box, between the  white noise, echo and random 
there is no competetion up to this point.  The  hacks are good, but nothing is 
better than an original frank's box.  Our  friends on the other side told me that 
they fixed the random mode to go and  teach others and i am going to a 
meeting on wednesday to demonstrate the  different boxes and our friend made a 
promise to come though if i go....so we  will see.
 
Here is one of the files i got so far.
