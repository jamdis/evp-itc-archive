I understand that sun interference would affect the day signal and a big factor is radio stations in the u.s. can boost their signal strength in later hours.  Might be urban legend.

Quite a few researchers get better reception at night.
I believe that is due to the fact that less signal traffic 
generally at night than during the day. consiquently that will 
allow for the weaker signals to be picked up.

      Bruce, I will definitely ask about the name Tim and about a tech. The
"very bored" part, at least if I'm hearing it correctly, proceeds as
soon and the name "Tim" is ending and is at a lot lower decibel level.
Could be one of those things meant for me to hear, as in I was boring
them. It's any body's guess.

I got better reception as I did the session at around 8:45pm. 
Nighttime seems better for reception around here.
