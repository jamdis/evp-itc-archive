I did post the unlabeld version first and not one friggin&#39; word. So Friday you can dismiss all of this.\n\n F-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; You claim I don&#39;t listen to any of this stuff because I can&#39;t take the chance I might hear something.  I do listen to some of them.   I hear stuff.  But I don&#39;t hear anything that I can&#39;t explain by simple pareidolia or random radio transmissions. So you&#39;re wrong there.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, to try to control for my own pareidolia, that is why I suggest the files not be labeled or explained.  That would help make listening to them a little less likely to be influenced by the perceptions of others, or made to &quot;fit their personal expectation&quot; as you noted.\n&gt; \n&gt; I continue to be at a loss as to why Frank is so defensive when people disagree with him.  If I don&#39;t listen or comment, Frank attacks me.  If I do listen and \n&gt; comment, Frank attacks me.  Is there no room for individuality and personal opinion? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 6/16/10, purplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: purplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Tesing-testing\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, June 16, 2010, 6:50 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;        I got your two cents! Post the freaking voice, unlabeled and not even a comment from the self proclaimed science dorks. Won&#39;t even give it try, to GD busy telling everyone what this stuff really is. Y0ou can&#39;t even listen to any of this stuff cuz yopu can not takle the chance you might hear someyhting. The rest, they are so locked up in the ghost hunter mentality they can&#39;t hear anything else.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t care if no one hear this shit, but not listen, or to say it said something else! That is number one probelm wiht this craop, everyone wnats it to fit their personal expectations, and  only they can be the world&#39;s expert.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what I expect, but enough is enough.
