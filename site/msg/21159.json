I have never encountered one.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do have a lot of ghost recordings.

You all can follow the childish\n&gt; &gt; crap is ya want, but I will not particapate. I will not make anymore boxes\n&gt; &gt; for people that want to run around in the dark chasing evil, and trying to\n&gt; &gt; get a fear rush going.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Already dumped one group this week, I can dump this one too. Y&#39;all can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; hear one freaking thing I say anyway.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
