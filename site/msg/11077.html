it goes, again&quot; -but this was recorded Sunday, but like 1 or 2 in the 
morning, so actually Monday the 26th. I kinda loose track of 
dates/times when I stay up all night. This is the wood box with the 
car tuner.  
&gt;  
&gt;  BTW, so far these wood boxes are unique in that one is an AM/FM 
car tuner, which(good ones) are hard to come by these days, and the 
other is a Radio Shack super hack, as I call it. So I don&#x27;t want to 
give up either one. 39 is the car tuner.
