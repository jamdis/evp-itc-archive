In that \nchamber, you will want probably an amplified microphone running into \nyour voice recorder, to pick up the sounds bouncing around in there.  \nYou can also add some white noise into the box, but I think people \nare getting results without adding the additional noise. The chamber \nseems to really bounce the sound around and give you a good mix to \nrecord.\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rita&quot; &lt;nvrenuf1031@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; New to group here.  We just completed the advance hack on our 469 \n&gt; model.  Are you supposed to hear the voices from the radio stations \nor \n&gt; just white noise?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, is it best to hook up an external speaker, one or two, in \norder \n&gt; to record to a digital recorder?  What is the best way to record, \nusing \n&gt; digital recorder, or direct into PC using Sound recorder, and using \na \n&gt; line in/line out connection?\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the recommended length of sessions.  Should I try just a \nminute \n&gt; or two, or longer at one sitting?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks to all!\n&gt; Rita\n&gt;"}
