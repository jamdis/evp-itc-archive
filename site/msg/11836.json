I&#39;ve met more angels than devils for sure. lol!  \n&gt; I&#39;m not convinced that having had an NDE was what caused Erland&#39;s,  \n&gt; my, and others sensitivity, but maybe. Some are just more sensitive  \n&gt; than others.  What was really interesting was that I was told that  \n&gt; I&#39;m &quot;very protected&quot; and that&#39;s what stopped the events - which I  \n&gt; can&#39;t say were all that negative, just unexpected and very super  \n&gt; natural. Having a voice come through the air vents of you vehicle,  \n&gt; lights flashing, papers flying, and even having your mail man  \n&gt; report &quot;something&quot; said hello to him on our porch when we weren&#39;t  \n&gt; home, was very unnerving, but I can&#39;t say it was all bad. Just  \n&gt; incredibly weird.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; One funny thing to note about my experience... I got annoyed -  \n&gt; REALLY annoyed at their behavior and refused to speak to them. I  \n&gt; was doing laundry when the light above me began buzzing/flashing  \n&gt; and suddenly a voice came through and apologized for the trouble.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think of these things now and hardly believe them myself. They  \n&gt; just seem a bit too &quot;Hollywood&quot; for my taste. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t  \n&gt; experience them alone and people that know me still talk about  \n&gt; things that happened today. It made very clear to me that this  \n&gt; world we experience in a body, isn&#39;t real. We&#39;re pretty limited in  \n&gt; what our mortal senses can perceive. Outside of this fleshy avatar  \n&gt; is so much more!\n&gt;\n&gt; w.\n&gt; On Aug 17, 2008, at 8:16 PM, Lisby wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I would reason that since the majority of people experience such  \n&gt;&gt; positive outcomes from an NDE--it is in the whole a positive  \n&gt;&gt; experience for almost every person who has one--it would not  \n&gt;&gt; provide the necessary negative energy for purportedly negative  \n&gt;&gt; entities to feed off. In fact, the majority of NDEers are  \n&gt;&gt; transformed in a very positive way indeed. Rarified, even. Seems  \n&gt;&gt; like an odd food choice for the Fishes.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nYou' e no he Bill om he AA-EVP lis , a e you?AnnOn Aug 17, 2008, a 8:30 PM, black bea hollow w o e:Amen o ha Ann.
