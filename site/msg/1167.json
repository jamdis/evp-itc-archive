The color image halfway \ndown the page is similar to what I witnessed along with several other \npeople during a meditation excercise that was the lead in to a \ndimensional portal building workshop.\n\n Frank, when you mentioned the &quot;purples&quot; to me while I was in CO, I \nimmediately thought of my experience but your description was \ndifferent. My encounter was with a mantis head being.\n\nRegards, Bill Murphy\n\np.s. we&#39;ve been operating and recording some box sessions. During our \nfirst sessions, the box seemed to be calling your name like it did when \nwe visited you. Through verbally stated intention, I communicated that \nyou have provided me with the box for continued research. Our last two \nsessions began by my name being announced by the box. It&#39;s almost as if \nthe spirit technicians (or etheral beings) now recognize my energy \nsignature being imprinted in this particular box.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ken Thomas &lt;kennnthomas2000@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.unknowncountry.com/news/?id=6132\n&gt;"}
