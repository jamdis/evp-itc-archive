I have not personally experienced the loss myself. Jon from this list is th=
e one who originally told me about it. I have also heard of it happening to=
 a few other people. After my conversation with Jon, I talked to a computer=
 professional, and he told me that you can experience loss in attached file=
s.

I don't know if you would be able to tell loss of quality in an audio f=
ile with a bit-level comparison. Just because the data has been replaced, d=
oesn't have to mean it is perfect.

Did you listen to the before and after =
results?

Jon-Please relay your experience with the loss of quality on emai=
led files.

        I can't vouch for your computer or server=
s, but I just did some tests, and sent a 2.1MB wav file from MSN to Yahoo a=
nd back, once allowing compression, and once turning it off.   I was able t=
o verify that one was compressed and one was not, by checking the sizes whe=
n they arrived at Yahoo. Once they came back to MSN, I then did a bit-level=
 comparison of the original, and the ones sent around email.  They were all=
 identical, which indicates lossless compression.

        If you have a fi=
le you'd like me to test for you, let me know.  But I wouldn't take someone=
's word for how your server's work, without testing them yourself.

          For executables, you may be right. However, for wav files, the c=
ompression during email is not loss less. 

          I used to think as yo=
u do, in that the emailed attachment of a wav file would not loose anything=
. After a lengthy discourse with another member here, I learned that I was =
wrong. The reason why I did not realize it in the first place is that when =
I would email a wav file, I would intentionally keep it in very small segme=
nts, to keep file size down. This was just for ease of transfer. But becaus=
e of this, I had not experienced any noticeable loss.

          Now it may=
 be in some cases, depending on the servers or what have you that the file =
goes through, that the loss may be less or more. But once the attachment is=
 downloaded, the quality has been found to be less then the original wav.

=
          Again though you can only really tell when the wav file is large.=

              =
    The kind of compression that occurs during an email attachment is "loss=
less": it compress the file cleverly without losing information.  For examp=
le, if I had a program in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it cou=
ld compress it.  But if it lost even one bit, the resulting exe file would =
not execute again after it was uncompressed on the other side.

           =
       This kind of compression does things like looking for common pattern=
s in the file, and replacing them with a token.  A rough example would be i=
f it found "Howdy Neighbor" in a file 20 times, it could replace all the oc=
curances with say $HN1.  And also write a little dictionary in there somepl=
ace that says "$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor".

                  When the file get=
s to its destination it can be uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are=
 replaced with "Howdy Neighbor".  So it was compressed (instead of 14 chara=
cters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionary), but lost no data.

    =
              Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not lossless.  Depending=
 on the level of compression, some level of data is lost, and so cannot be =
recovered or reconstructed later.

                    Another =
thing:

                    I recently found this out. When you email a fil=
e, if it is not saved as a compressed format, the email filtering process w=
ill actually compress the file automatically.

                    So even =
if you have attached a wav. file, it will loose resolution over the email p=
rocess. It will not sound exactly the same as the original wav. file. How m=
uch it differs depends on the size of the file you are attaching. If it is =
a very large file, it will sound much different.

                    The o=
nly exception to this is if the wav. file is small enough that the filterin=
g process will ignore it. It has to be pretty small though, like under 1 MB=
 (I am not exactly sure of the threshold).

                    The best wa=
y to share files over the internet if you want them as close to the origina=
l as possible is to upload them directly to a website.

                            Pixelization doesn't clean-u=
p the data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a picture of a field of flowers=
, and beginning to add levels or pixelization to the picture.  Soon, you wo=
uld not be able to tell there were flowers there at all.  You would see a l=
ot of colored blocks.

                            Or in the other directio=
n, imagine you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on your =
screen: a complete screen of truely random static snow.  Pixelizing this, a=
fter a while, you would again start to see colored blocks.

               =
             What's happening is that it is processing an area of the image=
, taking (for instance) the average value of that entire area, and replacin=
g all the blocks in that area with the average.  In video processing, this =
would result in a field of multi-colored flowers being replaced by, for ins=
tance, a big greyish-bluish block, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the =
noise example, it maybe replace all the random pixels with another big grey=
ish-bluish block.  If you did not know beforehand what the original picture=
 was, you couldn't tell whether your pixelized image was really a field of =
flowers, a chevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.

      =
                      It works the same with the sound files.  Taking somet=

                                Be a =
bit careful of formats like mp3 if you are doing a detailed analysis of the=
 sounds though.   While some formats (like wav) can store the audio very cl=

so doing lose some of the sonic details.  This may not be a big deal in mus=
ic, where the audio is fairly clear to begin with.  But with sound sources =
with a lot of noise (like evps), this can not only obscure any real sounds,=
 but pixelize non-sounds (like white noise) and make them start to sound li=
ke speech.

                                So mp3 might be good for sharin=
g the data, once you've already formed an opinion based on an analysis of t=

 many false positives and misinterpretations.

e kind of compression that occurs during an

ment is "lossless": it compress the file cleverly 
                  withou=
t losing information.  For example, if I had a 
                  prog=
ram in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it could 
               =
   compress it.  But if it lost even one bit, the resulting 
         =
         exe file would not execute again after it was uncompressed on 
   =
               the other side.<BR><BR>This kind of compression does things =

                  like looking for common patterns in the file, and replac=
ing 
                  them with a token.  A rough example would be if=
 it found 
                  "Howdy Neighbor" in a file 20 times, it could =
replace all the 
                  occurances with say $HN1.  And also=
 write a little 
                  dictionary in there someplace that says =
"$HN1=3DHowdy 
                  Neighbor".<BR><BR>When the file gets to it=
s destination it can 
                  be uncompressed, and all occurences=
 of $HN1 are replaced with 
                  "Howdy Neighbor".  So it=
 was compressed (instead of 14 
                  characters each, it only =
needed 4, plus the dictionary), but 
                  lost no data.<BR><BR=
