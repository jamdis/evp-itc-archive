It&#39;s actually a piece of free software that some charlatan decided to cash in on.  It&#39;s evpmaker with an allophone file created by Stefan Bion.  I guess i just saved some people $50 or whatever he&#39;s selling it for.  Also, for those who have questions about audio editing software there is more people on Ebay selling &quot;Audacity&quot; for like $20 and that&#39;s also free on the internet.\n\nhttp://www.keyportparanormal.com/evpsoftware.html\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;john54542&quot; &lt;jfrick45@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am now wondering what people know about Jason Profits Cross Talk. This is something that is being sold on Ebay as a &quot;ghost hunting tool&quot;. Supposedly it is better than Frank&#39;s box or the hack box. Has anyone got this or know anything about it?\n&gt;"}
