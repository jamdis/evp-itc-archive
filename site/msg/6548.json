It&#39;s fairly big in size so I went\n&gt; ahead and put it on there to help save space on here.  This is the link:\n&gt;\nhttp://www.esnips.com/doc/99a4a4b1-de10-40d8-943e-85b809a2332a/Session-4-01_30_08-20-125-govt\n&gt; \n&gt; I did as Bruce had asked and just used the RS 20-125 with a digital\n&gt; recorder and this is what I came up with.  It&#39;s a little over 30\n&gt; seconds long.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce, if you still want to hear all of this session, I will put it\n&gt; all on Esnips.  Just let me know.  There is quite a bit more to it\n&gt; than just this one clip.  It&#39;s amazing all the things that came through.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s a little background on the file.  I asked two questions.  The\n&gt; first was, &quot;Is the US governemnt using ITC research?&quot;  The second,\n&gt; &quot;How is the US goverment using ITC research?&quot;  I hear these things in\n&gt; this order: &quot;Yeah it is, just stop it, just stop, you need help,&quot; and\n&gt; something toward the end that I can&#39;t quite make out.  Sounds like a\n&gt; couple of words and then &quot;tells me to.&quot; Let me know what you think.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt;"}
