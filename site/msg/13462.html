Wow - I never met anyone who knew about Monroe's hemisync stuff.
I still ha=
ve the Gateway experience on cassette tapes from years ago.
I hear they've =
gone to CDs (which I don't think had been invented back then...)

            I've been looking around=
 the website:  

http://69.89. 31.222/~thesoun6 /?page_id=3D 26



And I've=
 joined the group.  The sounds are really different from what

I'm used to.=
  I *really* like Monroe's Gateway hemisync CD's.  It

seems the main diffe=
rence is most of the sounds Donald Adams developed

are more for the body, =
rather than the brain.



There are some samples for download.  I haven't h=
ad a chance to work

with them yet, but I'm really fascinated by the concep=
t.  It makes

perfect sense to me.  



I'm a little familiar with Reiki.  =
My main training is in a form of

energy work called Quantum Touch. And I t=
ook a weekend Pranic Healing

workshop which I enjoyed.  



Recently there=
 was a study done to see if one of Monroe's cd's

(created only for the stu=
dy, not for market) would improve the

reception of EVP.  To clarify, the s=
ounds where played through

headphones into the receiver's ear while conduc=
ting an EVP session. 

They were not used as background ... though come to =
think of it, that

might be an interest experiment in itself.  As I recall,=
 there was not

a significant change, one way or the other, when the sounds=
 where

listened to during recording.  But I was glad to see such research
=

taking place.  All data is helpful, in my opinion.
