  <<<You might try making contact with Misty's ST method, where you simply tune a radio across the band, AM or FM, slowly by hand, while recording directly from the speaker. It's pretty much the same as the box, the box just automates the process. i used to think I knew how it works, but all I know is that if we supply something to form voices out of, they talk!

          Frank,
 
About 3 seconds into this file there is what sounds like an oriental woman cursing.
Is that the same cursing file you posted last week ?
the part "in that way we hope they believe it" sound like radio, the voice is too consistent.

 I'll have to listen after I get home tonight. I have been with Chris when Edison (or someone claiming to be Edison) came through, as well as some of his spirit techs, and I could hear them, and have the tape, it's both sides of 90 minute rape. One problem is the voices are often severely distorted, or made out of noise.

 Some have problems with Moon, and I don't know if any of it is justified or not. 
 
 I think that dieclaimer about it being for entertainment is to avoid legal intanglements, and debunkers. Kinda like the guys the sell herbal cures that work, but the law prevents them from saying so.
 
 I can say only that the box works, something talks that is not from radio broadcasts, but what it is, is open to debate. I can't say it's all spirit contact, it seems to be eveything out in the ether that comes though at one time or another, and there seems to be an infinte number of levels, layers, or demensions--positive and negative--it gets confusing. This voice is meant to show it's not broadcast fragments, yet who it is remains an unknown.
