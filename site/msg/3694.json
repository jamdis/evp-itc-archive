Do not allow children under the age of 16 to use this device \n\n2. Although individual sessions are effective, group sessions are more \nproductive.\n\n3. This is not an &#39;electronic Ouija board&#39; - no harm can come from \nusing it. \n\n4. Some voices will use coarse language so be prepared for it. \n\n5. Always use a recorder to tape all sessions \n\n6. Keep a notebook with the times and locations of your sessions. \n\n7. The MiniBox will call you by name so don&#39;t be startled by it. \n\nLance"}
