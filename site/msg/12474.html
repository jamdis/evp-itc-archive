Every paranormal investigator I have talked to has told me one of the 
first major rules is NEVER run away and do your best to hide fear if 
you&#x27;re feeling it.

Hollyweird breaks that rule again and again.

I hope people don&#x27;t actually watch those shows thinking that&#x27;s the way to 
behave.

&gt; would hope to see when hunting for such thing. So instead of gathering

&gt; little girl. It&#x27;s friggin&#x27; Holywood B frikin&#x27; S! Lets all make it all

&gt;&gt; There are many here and on other lists who have contributed years of
&gt;&gt; free time way before you showed up on the recording scene.
&gt;&gt; Does it matter? No.
