&gt;  My Ghostman box. Or a swept tuned Walkman. I&#x27;ve been thinking about the Mini box, and we&#x27;ve shown on this group that the sound chamber I use is definately not needed, so that eliminates the mics and added amps as well. I kinda missed the manufacturing boat by not doing more testing, or being stuck on a concept. Not that I&#x27;m all that concerned, I had no desire to make money off this stuff, and that probelm seems to have been solved. 
&gt;  Despite concerns by the more conserative researchers, I guess I could call them, I have never seen any one harmed by any kind of oracle device(granted-I don&#x27;t get out much).  I think getting this stuff out there in the public is a good thing.
