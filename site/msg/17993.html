My take on it is that the spirits or whatever th=
ey are are capable  of 
using whatever methods are placed in front of them.=
 DVR's get EVP. I've  gotten 
EVP on the sound tracks of a video recorder. =
The radio and ITC seems  to 
generate a different class of communication. E=
VP-Maker is another  one.
 
Probably the method of actually producing the s=
ound waves is  different for 
each device.
