Then I was hoping to catch it on the replay tonight but the \nradio \n&gt; at work will not dial down 15 to where the station is =/\n&gt; \n&gt; I tried to &quot;will&quot; it to go down 15 on the dial from 565 to 540 but \nI \n&gt; just aint that mentally powerful I guess LOL. \n&gt; \n&gt; Yeah I know I should just get a membership over there, there and \nalot \n&gt; of other places who charge fees for info that is public(ahem)LOL. \nNot \n&gt; happening this year. Over a grand on the vet bills, personal loans \nto \n&gt; friends, bills, and now its christmas and I was going to play \nscrooge \n&gt; but they are already askin about what I did last year wonderin if I \n&gt; was doin it for everyone again this year so... \n&gt; \n&gt; Instead I told my bosses to give my hours to those who need $$$ for \n&gt; holidays because they are cutting back everyones hours for a couple \n&gt; weeks. Besides I could use the rest LOL. Doubt they will but I will \n&gt; insist they cut me rather than a fulltime mom with 3 kids who needs \n&gt; every cent she earns and then some.\n&gt; \n&gt; So hoping I have a few extra days off this year to listen to you \nguys \n&gt; radio chats. Theres quite a few of them now. Ive downloaded those \n&gt; that would let me so I can listen to them and share them with a \n&gt; friend at work.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone has that podcast email me. \n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt;"}
