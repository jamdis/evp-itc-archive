<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I send this type of box out and invariably I hear back &quot;that doesn&#x27;t work!&quot;
This is single supply random mode, seems to work here! Starts out &quot;--be
good&quot;, at 4 seconds &quot;This is to calm Chris down&quot;, at 11 seconds &quot;this is
recorded for the people&quot;, and at the end &quot;the girl is seventeen&quot; --I get
that alot, and I don&#x27;t why it is important. &quot;They&quot; claim the &quot;princess&quot; was
kidnapped, it&#x27;s the one thing I do remember, and at the same age she was,
17,  I actually relived the event, so maybe it&#x27;s for validation. I don&#x27;t
believe in living in the past,  reliving past traumas, or grieving.
 I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m still uncertain if random has an advantage, the messages
seem longer and in a more natural sounding voice.

 Single supply random takes some finessing to make it work, so I prefer to
use dual supplies. + and - 12 volts.===more batteries==more $$$ to operate.
