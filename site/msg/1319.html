<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>What you got is absolutely astounding. Can I ask you to do me a huge  
favor? Would you try it with the Harry Houdini wax recording? If you  
could, I would deeply grateful.

&gt; Misty--OMG. This is amazing. What live recordings did you feed into  
&gt; EVPMaker?
&gt;
&gt; I wonder if working with their own voice in EVPmaker makes it  
&gt; easier for them to construct an EVP? These are some of the clearest  
&gt; EVP through EVPmaker that I have ever heard. I am really astounded.

&gt;&gt; These are from a few days ago (attached to this post for new  
&gt;&gt; members you need to set status to &quot;individual email&quot; setting for  
&gt;&gt; the group to get attachments). I decided since I downloaded some  
&gt;&gt; of Edison&#x27;s historical speech to compare to my evp voice that I  
&gt;&gt; wondered what I would get if I threw one of those into evpmaker. I  
&gt;&gt; got a little more than I thought I would. It even made me have to  
&gt;&gt; google to look up the meaning of one of the technical words LOL
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I also included the evp vs life speech side by side comparison  
&gt;&gt; with the evp I got from ST method. Since thats how this started  
&gt;&gt; and for those who just joined group and have no idea what I am  
&gt;&gt; talkin about.
