<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>We have 2 here, but both are about 30 min. from me. Here in the  
mountains, nothing is close. Let me know if you find something there.  
I&#x27;d be shocked. Mexico is an amazing place though. (I&#x27;m a Native Texan  
&amp; loved going over the border.)

Yes, there are some people who get amazing results without effort and  
immediately, some record for months before finally getting one voice -  
Sarah Estep was one of these people, and others simply never get great  
results. I&#x27;m not sure why that is unless it&#x27;s just a natural talent  
and some have it, some don&#x27;t. I like your piano analogy. Many can  
learn to play, but only a few master the instrument and are naturals.  
I&#x27;m reminded of the movie Amadeus. Salieri SO wanted to write music  
like Mozart. He had such passion, and it infuriated him that Mozart  
could write a piece that was perfect with no effort whatsoever and  
took his gift for granted. Salieri just didn&#x27;t have it and his envy  
ruled his life.

Keep us posted on the use of the Ovilus. I get frustrated with  
dictionary mode. It keeps repeating numbers to me... then &quot;energy&quot;...  
then &quot;people&quot;... then numbers... &quot;70&quot;.... &quot;5&quot;... &quot;million&quot;...  
&quot;people&quot;... &quot;thunder&quot;... &quot;30&quot;... &quot;9&quot;... &quot;million&quot; *sigh*

&gt; begun searching whatever I could find on the subject of Spiritualist  
&gt; Churches etc.  Looking for something in Mexico near or in the  
&gt; Yucatan.  If you seek historic sites to visit, come to Campeche.
&gt;
&gt; Regarding the mix of EVP ITC tech and spiritualism beliefs, I must  
&gt; say again that I was very impressed when I read ALL the information  
&gt; on the website you provide for Sandra Belanger.  Her case history of  
&gt; the Peterson case was a wonderful model of working with her evp  
&gt; skills and mediumship sensitivities.
&gt;
&gt; As for me?  I&#x27;m still taking piano lessons and can barely put down  
&gt; the rhythm.  But I am very encouraged (again) by what I am learning  
&gt; from you and many in this and other evp groups.   I plan to keep  
&gt; working with evpmaker and the Ovilus.  ron
