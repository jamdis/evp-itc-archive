The PCBs have to ordered in sets of three, that&#39;s why I don&#39;t make\nmany of these. That&#39;s $85 just for the boards, and maybe another $60 for\nparts, and labor= endless hours and no pay. I can go to RS and get a perf\nboard that will make two systems for about 6 bucks.  There is absolutely\nzero profit in this stuff.\n\n F-S\n\nThe in o on he boa ds was p o ided o echies, incase hey wan ed o o de he boa ds and assmeble hem.  Wi h Ch is mas coming, I ha e no money o pa s and am ha ing a ha d ime assembling he boxes I need o ge done.  The PCBs ha e o o de ed in se s o h ee, ha 's why I don' make many o hese. Tha 's $85 jus o he boa ds, and maybe ano he $60 o pa s, and labo = endless hou s and no pay. I can go o RS and ge a pe boa d ha will make wo sys ems o abou 6 bucks.  The e is absolu ely ze o p o i in his s u .  \n\n \n F-S"}
