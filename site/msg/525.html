lol
  how humorous! Who would be childish enough to send the emails to your boss?? Are you 14 Frank? lol What difference would it make to your boss? But then i see that you are using district email for these postings. I would recommend that you STOP that! You could get fired for inappropriate use of email. Meaning ANYTHING thats not work related. If you cant use web based email then your gonna have to figure out another way to e-mail. Cell phone, prtable laptop, etc. I dont see why you feel that you need to stop corespondance. Who gives a flying fuck what anyone thinks of you? I personally dont see anything in those emails thats really sick?! Its alot of fighting and talking shit, which i might add is pretty mild in MY opinion. AND its NOT one sided, I am sure that thier are emails that were NOT sent, that both of you wrote. Who cares? WHO CARES? WHO CARES! WHO CARES! WHO CARES! WHO CARES! 
  EVERYONE just get a life, leave each other alone, do your work, post what you find, comment about it. Quite e-mailing each other privatly talking shit, then when the heat gets to be to much start acting like babies. Dont start it if you cant take it! WHO CARES! 
  GET ON WITH LIFE AND DONT TALK TO PEOPLE THAT PISS YOU OFF!

into arguements saved all my e-mails, and forwarded them to my boss. I 
was too stubborn, and keep firing back insults to match her insults. 

So if if anyonme else gets these personal attacks from the debunker, 
best to to ignopre it.
