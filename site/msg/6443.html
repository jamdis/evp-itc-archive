<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think we are all drawing from the same pool. I just don&#x27;t know how  
to explain these same names coming up again and again.

&gt; I ask if my technician&#x27;s name is David (which is also the name of
&gt; someone else&#x27;s guide), which is info I got from Bruce. I hear,
&gt; &quot;Steven.&quot; followed by, &quot;It isn&#x27;t.&quot; The I get the names &quot;Nicholson
&gt; Lawson,&quot; something I can&#x27;t understand, and then &quot;Ben Wilson.&quot;
&gt; Nicholson is interesting to me because it is a family name. I&#x27;m not
&gt; sure if Nicholson Lawson is one name or it is a Nicholson and a
&gt; Lawson. For some reason, I got the feeling the name Ben Wilson was a
&gt; complete name.
&gt;
&gt; Thoughts?
