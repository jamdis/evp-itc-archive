I know that I am not very active in this\ngroup but I do read everything.  To me that was a pure attack.  Yes they are\ndebunkers and they won&#39;t believe anything, but if you don&#39;t say anything and\njust back down there is that one person out there that will be swayed they\nway of the skeptic and will not here our side.  Slap away and let us be\nheard and get our opinions and beliefs out there.  If it touches one person\n(Like me I used to be one of those &quot;debunkers&quot; then I heard the stuff that\ncomes through ITC and EVP research) it is worth the carpal tunnel.  And to\nadd I am a investigator who still uses a debunking aspect toward the\ninvestigation,  but I am also a researcher and if there is something new out\nthere I am always willing to test it and see what comes through.\n\nOn Tue, Apr 28, 2009 at 3:17 PM, Fransen, Debbie\n&lt;debbie.fransen@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  YES, yes I do.........LMAO\n&gt;\n&gt;  ------------------------------\n&gt; *From:* EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] *On\n&gt; Behalf Of *April Abercrombie\n&gt; *Sent:* Tuesday, April 28, 2009 2:56 PM\n&gt;\n&gt; *To:* EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: [EVP-ITC] A skeptic blog/article.\n&gt;\n&gt;   You just want to watch LOL!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; *From:* Fransen, Debbie &lt;debbie.fransen@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; *Sent:* Tuesday, April 28, 2009 12:48 PM\n&gt; *Subject:* RE: [EVP-ITC] A skeptic blog/article.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I say slap them Frank.
