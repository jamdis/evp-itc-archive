I was re=
cording on an Olympus VN-960PC in a cemetery a couple years ago. 
There was=
 a tower for an AM radio station on the edge of the cemetery. 
WHen I playe=
d the recording at home later, I heard the radio station 
during most of th=
e recording.

So I decided to do a test. I drove around to all the local ra=
dio 
stations, both AM and FM, and recorded within a couple blocks of the 
=
antenna. I got the stations on recordings for both AM and FM frequencies.

=
I also get the cell phone "Dum diddleum diddleum diddleum buzzzzzz" on the =

recorder too when someone has one nearby.
