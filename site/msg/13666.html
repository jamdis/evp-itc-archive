That maybe, I don't know. But you have to be careful with the History chann=
el. I have caught them saying some things that were not accurate before.

   Well, there's other cultures that have th=

Jews(?), the Egyptians, and various european prhophets.  I think I'm the on=

I do have my doubts that it is the end of the world completely.

    You kn=

robably just left off at 2012 and didn't bother to extend it for the next c=
ycle, whatever that would be.

    That's my hunch anyway and that what I a=

      The reverse is often more distorted, I think I'm just used=

       This is the stuff I've been getting since t=

               I rarely know if anyone hears this stuff, as fe=

ifferent this morning. That's the only one I hear different from last night=
. I included the forward, and reverse components. 

               These ar=
