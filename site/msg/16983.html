<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have done extensive experiences with the Ouija Board. I have never been
able to prove anything except that it is our own minds controlling the

&gt;  Hey guys,
&gt;
&gt; I am doing some research on the Bloody Mary ritual and Ouija Boards. I am
&gt; looking for anyone with stories or experiences from those that would be
&gt; willing to share them - as well as any research and evidence you may have
&gt; gathered from them. I am looking to bring the folklore together with the
&gt; history, science and experience.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
