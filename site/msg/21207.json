I want to listen to your files, however your link goes to your homepage and then i surf around but cannot find exactly what you are raving about.\n\nMaybe you can just post some audio clips on here or a direct link to the actual pages that contain the material you are writing about.\n\nThanks again,\n-Steve\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rick Wegrzyn &lt;rickwegrzyn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; increditable evps Taken from the Melting Pot in Littleton,Colorado.....Must Hear\n&gt; \n&gt; www.realinvestigationsoftheparanormal.net\n&gt;"}
