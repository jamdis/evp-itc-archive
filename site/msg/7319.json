Its the will to continue that makes us and defines  us.  You have \ncontinued your research where the others have left off  in the past.  And in doing so \nYOU have created a new science for  all of us to follow and research.  We may \nbe small in numbers but  yet we are still considered a scientific community.  \nAnd if it had not been  for you we would not be where we are at this point.  \nYes it is  not perfect but so far it is the best.  Maybe in the near future \nthere will  be easier and better ways to get there but isn&#39;t that what you are \ntrying to  accomplish?  So don&#39;t come down on yourself when it comes to the \nboxes  you are developing.  Because you are leading us towards the future  with \nyour own research.  And for this we are all greatfull and look  towards the \nfuture with you.\n \nWell this is just how I see it.  \n \nJeff\n \n \nIn a message dated 2/26/2008 2:06:59 A.M.
