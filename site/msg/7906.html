<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Ralph, I know this program, it can be downloaded from
http://www.evpuk.com/evp_assistant_information.html and it&#x27;s a noise
generator which can play up to 5 prerecorded sounds simultaneously. The
spiricom noise sounds a bit different than the one I had created by
simply mixing the 13 frequencies (131, 141, 151, 241, 272, 282, 292,
302, 415, 443, 515, 653, 701 Hz); obviously not all of the tones have
the same level, and some vary constandly. I have a copy of the original
Spiricom tape on which the sound of the voices can be heard. It&#x27;s a
robotic like sound and it reminds me of Vocoder voices, or voices made
with these speech aid devices for people with larynx cancer (dunno the
technical term for these devices).

&gt; Hi Stefan,

 
&gt;  I have a program I got off the internet called &quot;EVP Assitant&quot;that has 
&gt; has the 13 tones of the old Spiricom Mk-4 system and it also has whiye 
&gt; noise and pink noise and a water fall audio files on it. IT&#x27;S A FREE 
&gt; PROGRAM !!! So it might be of use in this itc group research. I 
&gt; thought I should pass that along if anyone wants a great little 
&gt; proggie. If it&#x27;s free it&#x27;s for me LOL. Just do a Google on EVP 
&gt; Assitant then you should find it easily. You could record the tones to 
&gt; a CD and use it that way or whatever. Well you all take care. Keep up 
&gt; the great research.

&gt; Regards,
