I like it when the voices come through one word at a time so that their message is much clearer.   I find that when they take the time to do this, it is so much easier to understand than the other times where they seem to try to speak very quickly to get multiple words in at once.  I wonder how they differentiate between these two different ways of speaking on the other side.  Do the technicians help?  It would be interesting to find out.\n\nTim\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, urkel23@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Still waiting for the new tuners to come in the mail, so i finished up and  \n&gt; did a quick session with this box.  Got a few good ones i think, this 588  \n&gt; tuner is much more noisy than the stuff i&#39;ve been using.  Seems to have a  \n&gt; unique quality with this box though, i don&#39;t hear too much radio frag.  It  \n&gt; almost seems to be only communication.  The board is running at 6V and the  \n&gt; radio is 3V.  Once i crammed everything into the case it stopped working,  \n&gt; must be too much in there.  I moved stuff around and it seems stable at the  \n&gt; moment.  I wanted to see if i can do this, but i&#39;m going back to the boom  \n&gt; boxes.  Not that they are better, but a lot less work.\n&gt;  \n&gt; S-H\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Steve Hultay\n&gt; _www.keyportparanormal.com_ (http://www.keyportparanormal.com/) \n&gt; _http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/_ \n&gt; (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/) \n&gt; _www.stevehultay.com_ (http://www.stevehultay.com/) \n&gt; _www.rtscresearch.org_ (http://www.rtscresearch.org/)\n&gt;"}
