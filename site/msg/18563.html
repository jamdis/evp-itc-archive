<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah I know, science no accept anecdotes. There is plenty of hard evidence,
trouble, science don&#x27;t accept that either cuz they are taught, no spirits,
so there are no sprit voices, fact is fact is facts. Well that&#x27;s about all
there is in this field. Perhaps you should take bird watching or something
concrete. To not accept what others say is the same as calling us all liars,
and I find very insulting.

 How irrational is it to ignore all evidence and continuously try to fit the
phenomon into a diffintion where it will not fit and does not belong, and
then claim you&#x27;re looking for a more rational explantation, it just does not
make sense. I say forget the BS &quot;science&quot; whatever that is, puts out and try
thinking on your own.  Mr Spock was a fictional charactor!

&gt;  If you completely ignore what everyone else in the whole wide freaking
&gt; world gets via EVP, various photography and ITC methods, and just chance
&gt; encounters, then yeah, you probably don&#x27;t have any data, and won&#x27;t have any
&gt; data no matter what.

&gt;   I don&#x27;t think I have enough data yet to make any conclusions, so I plan
&gt; more experiments.  Since there are different distinct claims about what the
&gt; box or the recorders can do, I try to make different distinct experiments
&gt; for each.
&gt;
&gt; Some people claim they can get the box to tell them things that the
&gt; operator couldn&#x27;t know, so my &quot;whats the object&quot; experiment is one way to
&gt; examine that.  Some people claim the boxes can make predictions, so
&gt; cataloging predictions and examining the results can help examine that.  If
&gt; there are other claims, I will try to figure experiments based on those.

&gt;  I get our last dogs from time to time, and used to get them via white
&gt; noise when I first started this. Last summer some kids came down into the
&gt; basement wiht the younger grandson, and the little yorkie barked, but &quot;get
&gt; outta here&quot; came out, some how.
&gt;
&gt;  Yeah, I think I was too hard on RJ. I don&#x27;t know why, but testing doens&#x27;t
&gt; seem to work, but we get enough to prove this to ourselves. It&#x27;s probably a
&gt; faith thing, although I&#x27;m not religious, even anti-religion.

&gt; Here is a short file, where someone says, &quot;Scamp, Scamp,&quot; then Scamp barks.
&gt; &quot;yap.&quot;  This little dog belonged to my grandma, when I was about 9 or 10
&gt; years old, he was a Manchester Terrier, and lived with us for many years,
&gt; and this is his bark for sure.  I&#x27;d know that bark anywhere.  Sorry, that I
&gt; can&#x27;t make it any clearer, I need to get one of those better ghost boxes I
&gt; guess.  RJ, spirits are just like us, they are not omnipresent like
&gt; God,  probably why David doesn&#x27;t want to play the guessing game, he has
&gt; better things to do over there, and has said, they have thousands of people
&gt; standing in this long line waiting to get into the Heavens, and He can&#x27;t
&gt; just drop His job and go to your house to see what you have over there, He
&gt; did tell me that first time what it was, and i sent it to you, but it was
&gt; too late.  It&#x27;s hard for me to understand them sometimes, He was also right
&gt; about that little boy, Syler being killed, and where his body would be
&gt; found, I don&#x27;t know what they did about it though. sf
