I and other researchers like m=\r\ne have brought this research light years from where it was when you and I f=\r\nirst met, moon just continues to use it to rip people off and has not contr=\r\nibuted a thing to the research of ghost box communication beside lining his=\r\n own pockets. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just the fact that he has you doing his dirty work sh=\r\nows the type of guy he is. I can remember a time when you publicly came out=\r\n against any type of money making using your boxes and even refused moon wh=\r\nen he wanted to manufacture and sell them for large profits yet now you con=\r\ndone\n his robbery of innocent unaware people and actually act foolish on hi=\r\ns behest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Frank you are better than this, just concentrate on develo=\r\nping a better box and forget about moon and his tricks and lies, he is fini=\r\nshed in the paranormal and he knows it, everyone is wise to his game and he=\r\n is practically an outcast.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Frank you are hitching you wagon to a de=\r\nad horse. Get away from these bad influences before they ruin your reputati=\r\non as well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We have had this moon discussion in the past and once he=\r\n has exhausted his need for you he will screw you again like he has done so=\r\n many times before.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Frank, I like and respect you and I hope you wil=\r\nl consider what I have said in this e-mail and I sincerely hope you post th=\r\nis one on the evp-itc group. I will be posting it on my group and others I =\r\nbelong to.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your former friend&lt;BR&gt;Bruce&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=\r\n=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial, san-serif; COLOR: black&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HR&gt;\n&lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1221354145x1201369495/aol?redir=\r\n=3Dhttp:%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fclk%3B215221161%3B37268813%3By&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;Limited Time Offers: Save big on popular laptops a=\r\nt Dell&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-1266905641-1244217533=:30747--"}
