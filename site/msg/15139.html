That's funny! They never say what I expect them to say. LOL As a matter of =
fact they are really good about saying shit that don't make sense until it =
happens later. Or, I would get messages for Misty or Laura and even Sumptio=
n that made no sense to me what-so-ever because those were the other folks =
within our circle.

I look at the "help me's", the "nasty ones" and othe=
rs as levels of our own=A0contact=A0evolution or levels we work past to get=
 to the ones who can speak coherantly. Those voices fade as you concentrate=

 and lost" folks.

As for making your own realities after you die, I fol=
low a Bruce Moen style viewpoint where there are what is called Hollow heav=

see, but only for a while. You slowly are brought out of those realities by=
 helpers whose job it is to do so. Anyways, just a thought! One of many!

This crap I hear about people supposedly cro=
ssing over stuck souls with a box? 

Does not anyone get the concept that y=
ou create what you expect in the paranormal? If you think there's hauntings=
, you create the evidence to support that. If you think there's stuck souls=
 you'll have no shortage of ghosts screaming for your superhuman help. Of c=
ourse, you also create the illusion of being the big expert as well-which i=
s what I think many want most.

Just a suggestion-- but grow up people!
