<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Margaret I will try those settings. I have DC7 full and am able
to record(log) as long as I want :)
One thing I noticed like you I can stop and then add/subtract filters
and restart the log. The final file saved will have all with no
interruptions. The lag seems no problem and the real time filters do
help for me to understand. I also tune up prior with audacity looking
for a nice waveform, not to big and not to small. I have many times
had stuff I could not understand because the volume was to loud and
the waveform was distorted. Oh well just some obs. Thanks for your help.

&gt; Hi Jim.  I had some success using DC6 Live Forensics and real-time
monitoring with 
&gt; headphones, using no background at all, as well as using radio
sweep.  But as you 
&gt; mentioned, the filters that worked well one session often did not
work the next.  Go 
&gt; figure! ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; The demo of version 6 Forensics was cool because it worked for only
1 minute at a time 
&gt; but never expired.  The demo of version 7 Forensics is a full
working version, without time 
&gt; restrictions, but after 30 days, it no longer works.  
&gt; 
&gt; I used the setup a little differently in that I didn&#x27;t use DC to
record my sessions.  I used a 
&gt; second computer and a splitter line for the sound so when the 1
minute time limit hit, I 
&gt; didn&#x27;t have to stop the session, just rehit the play button so there
was only a second or so 
&gt; gap between each minute.  As I recall my setup looked like this:
&gt; 
&gt; External mic to PC sound in
&gt; Split line from PC sound out going to A) Mac laptop sound in &amp; B) my
headphones
&gt; 
&gt; Looking back through my notes, I had some pretty good results with
the following 
&gt; settings:
&gt; 
&gt; Continuous Noise First
&gt; * Attack 10
&gt; * Release 364
&gt; * Attenuation 31
&gt; * CNF Forensic
&gt; * FTF 2048
&gt; * Overlap 50%
&gt; 
&gt; Brick Wall Second
&gt; * Frequency 3
&gt; * Upper Frequency 8291
&gt; * Length 948
&gt; 
&gt; I just tried a variety of settings willy-nilly and happened to have
success with this one 
&gt; among a couple others.

&gt; &gt; Anyone using dc6/dc7(Diamond Cut DC7) software. I have been
&gt; &gt; experimenting with different filters to listen and record radio
&gt; &gt; sweep(RS hack 20-125).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I wonder if anyone has found good filters and mods to the filters for
&gt; &gt; using it real time filtering. The other day I threw together some of
&gt; &gt; there pre-built filters and got a good session(easier to listen to).
&gt; &gt; The next session those filters did not seem to work as well. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here is a quote from the site below(not the software distributor).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &quot;DC6 is an audio editing program just like the ones we use for EVP
&gt; &gt; (Audacity, Audition, GoldWave), except it has a neat feature called
&gt; &gt; &quot;Live Multi-Filter.&quot; With this feature, audio coming into the computer
&gt; &gt; can be filtered live and the result heard with a short delay of a
&gt; &gt; second or so. A typical setup for EVP would be a microphone into the
&gt; &gt; Microphone In jack of the computer with DC6 Live filtering what comes
&gt; &gt; from the microphone and the output playing on the headphones connected
&gt; &gt; to the computer&#x27;s Headphone Out.&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For those that have not heard of it, hear is a page explaining on how
&gt; &gt; to use this piece of software.
