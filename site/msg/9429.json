Even if you had saved it on the computer it may  \nnot have all come thru.  Always have to remember that some things may only  be \nmeant for you to hear.  I have experienced this many times.  My  brother&#39;s \nfather-in-law died and he immediately went to Florida to make the  arrangements.  \nBut before he went he asked me to do a favor for him and I  said yes.  It had \nbeen 2 days since he died and I tried to contact him on  my box.  My \ntechnician was very accomodating with this and in fact go  retrieve my brother&#39;s \nfatherinlaw for me to talk too.  Low and behold his  voice came across the radio \nsaying I&#39;M HERE in his thick old country Italian  voice.  Now even though I \nrecorded it somehow it did not record.  I  spent well over an hour examining my \nrecorder and that session to no  avail.  I thought I was going nuts until it was \nexplained to me.  SO  you just might be surprise what a lot of us here will \nbelieve.\n \nJeff\n \n \nIn a message dated 4/11/2008 12:41:36 P.M.

O well I would like to tell you  that it \nreally is true, and I know in my heart, because I was there.  Not  sure why them \ncpu went off, but maybe I had too much infomation then they  wanted me too.( I \nrecord write on to my laptop, and I don&#39;t use any  type of digital or analog \nrecorder).  I will prove it again.   Tonight I am going to do everything the \nsame to see if I can get it to happen  again.\n \nRees\n\nreesclarke_69  &lt;reesclarke_69@reesclark&gt; wrote:\n\n \nHey guys\n\nI had the most amazing session last night. Me and my  fiance \ndid a session, and this is how it went. \n\nWe usally do 10  min. of audio, and during the session we first \ncontacted a guy named  Virgil, and we got him to say both of our \nnames. He said &quot;William&quot; for  me, and &quot;Leigh&quot; for Ashley. We all \ncommunicated for the 10 min. He  didn&#39;t answer every question, but \nhe answered 75% of all answerslast  night. We told him that we \nwanted to prove that they exsisted on the  other side. Life after \ndeath. He answer &quot;we are over here&quot;, very  plainly. After the 10 \nmin. We ask for confirmation so we could shut off  the radio, and we \ngot this answer &quot;that would be a bad idea&quot;. Which  freaked Ashley \nout. So we kept the radio on and we had a conversation  with this \npreacher, then while the band was still sweeping the preacher  came \nthrough and he talked to us (while sweeping the band), and started  \nto preach to us about our side, and how messed up it is.(the band  \nwas sweeping the whole time, I never stop the band from sweeping) \nHe  said that we needed to pray for our enemies as well as our \nfriends and  families. He talked to us for 6 to eight minutes. \nThen we finished the  session (Ask for confirmation)Then we finishe\ncome through any more.  We shut down. Then of course I get up and \nput everything back the way it  is supposed to be. Leaving the \nsession that we just did on the laptop.  Then I went to take a \nshower, and I come back. The laptop was turned off  and I lost all \nof the session. Sometimes the computer will log itself  off, then \nwhen you get back it is exactly the was it was when you left  it. \nBut this wasn&#39;t the case, some reason the laptop shut itself off,  \nand we lost all of the evidence that we had. Didn&#39;t have nothing,  \nand I couldn&#39;t believe that we lost everything. So thats why I am  \nsitting here typing away about what happen last night. Instead of \nme  posting files about what happen last night. I wish so bad that \ny&#39;all  would have been able to hear the communication. It was a life \nchanging  experience. It made me think a whole lot different about \nbox research. I  still can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t save it before the \ncomputer turned itself  off. That is what happen to me last night, \nand change box research for  me for the rest of my life.\n\nThanks\n\nWilliam Rees Clarke  III\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo  You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
