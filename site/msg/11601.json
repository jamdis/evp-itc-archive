Sounded like you used the allophone file for the raw audio.

This was recorded at the farm I grew up on,\n&gt; where my\n&gt; brother and his family now live.  My two nieces (age 17 and\n&gt; 21) have\n&gt; had various occurrences there so we thought we&#39;d try\n&gt; out some of this\n&gt; new stuff and see what we&#39;d get.  We got quite a few\n&gt; interesting\n&gt; results I think.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is part of one where we asked if they are there, and\n&gt; then how\n&gt; many are there. This one was made with EVPMaker (the RS\n&gt; 20-125 didn&#39;t\n&gt; work so well out in the country - maybe not enough\n&gt; noise/sounds for\n&gt; them to use??)  The answer is &quot;We are at eight, Yeah,\n&gt; there are\n&gt; eight.&quot;  I think it&#39;s pretty clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt; \n&gt; ~ Becca"}
