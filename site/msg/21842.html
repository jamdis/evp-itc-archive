I think everyone takes this stuff way tooooooo seriou=

expectations. I don't care about heavan, the afterlife, =
or crossing over  
spirits, or getting the proof, I let "them" talk, and I =
listen. Not gonna  judge 
what "they" say, and not gonna get offended if it=
 doesn't fit my world  view( 
or lack of world view). They tell me earth is=
 doomed, I don't care!  Que 
Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be).
 
 I d=
on't know anything, and I don't wanna know anything. Everything  
started f=
rom nothing, so the only true reality is nothing. Meditate on  
nothing--be=
 nothing! Nothing is everything, when you become nothing, you are  
everyth=

 Yeah, get that past the ego fi=
