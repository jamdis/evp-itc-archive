<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey, I remember a past life of mine where I was a male sailor in the 1500s, so really one&#x27;s sex means just about squat in my opinion.  Just a technicality.  Princess, Keira, whatever.  You know, now that you say that....maybe they are calling me Steve?  Maybe I&#x27;ve got it all wrong?  Definitely something to ponder!

&gt; me, but he works with the Geophone and was at teh QM event last fall.

&gt;  I am Kiera! I&#x27;m getting to damn old to worry about what the thinks about
&gt; it, we all have our alternate identies, as we are not this physical body.
