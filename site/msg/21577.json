It is just the hurricanes, earthquakes, tidal waves, and that sort of \n&gt; thing is what people will think about. I think it&#39;s because of the technology of \n&gt; web cams and the Internet will show us much more than the past news we received \n&gt; about that bad stuff. Which is what I believe the war on terror is actually \n&gt; about.\n&gt; For your 2012 question I asked Tarot: \n&gt; It&#39; is the 4 of cups!\n&gt; We are receiving but we are not happy.\n&gt; http://www.kufty.com/tarot/fours.htm\n&gt; I am just seeing these cups of love( EVP trophies) in front of you. More \n&gt; EVPs are offer to you, but...\n&gt; Apathy, Boredom, Re- evaluation, Hope, Day Dreaming, Self- Absorbed, \n&gt; Disillusioned, is what tarot shows me about you  from the boxes and the news.\n&gt; Any question for me as a psychic, love/money/career questions I&#39;ll answer.

I tried to explain \n&gt; &gt;that \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I had EVPs on the radio since the early 70&#39;s. Back then people would think EVP \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; was evil and many would attack me even though I was under age. I also explained \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; EVP to many people because I had a vision of how too do Ghostbox by flipping \n&gt; &gt;the \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; radio dial. I also explained:Â Songs can be used like Tarot cards! Anything can \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; speak to a person like the wind for example..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Besides having visions I also used to sing songs on the radio years before they \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; came out. The news recorded me many times singing songs and warning of things \n&gt; &gt; before they happened. That&#39;s how I got to do movie/rock star readings and \n&gt; &gt;warned \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; of things like 9/11 to politicians and put things in the media like &quot;The plane! \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The plane!&quot; on Fantacy Island. http://youtu.be/_xG7Qwv23sgÂ that would warn of \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; the 9/11 terror attacks or actually warning of the conspiricy with-in and that \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; someone was doing something.\n&gt; &gt; The 9/11 emergency phone number is also a warning of Â 9/11 terror attacks and \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; the feeling someone was going to do something.\n&gt; &gt; What I am saying isÂ I was there (in the 70&#39;s)with the politicians in Canada \n&gt; &gt; warning of 9/11 to Americain politiciansÂ saying we would make the emergency \n&gt; &gt; phone number the same accross north America and what the number meant. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We also spoke of the TV shows that warned of 9/11. Fantacy Island, SCTV and \n&gt; &gt;many \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; other tv shows or songs that would have a 9/11 feeling. SCTV is a great example \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; of thisÂ where all of Canada was saying &quot;Take-off eh. Like you know eh, you \n&gt; &gt; hosers you know.&quot; It even became a hit song. http://youtu.be/1BFPt001PYU Rush \n&gt; &gt; sang with the SCTV comediens Bob and Doug and it became a large part of a \n&gt; &gt; Canadian&#39;s identity, &quot;Like you know,eh?&quot;(a psychic expression like we all \n&gt; know)\n&gt; &gt; I did this type of thing for many TV shows, movies, songs and politicians of \n&gt; &gt; many countries. I put my image in some of it and it shows too.\n&gt; &gt; The whole time people have been trying to dismiss me, get me to loose me \n&gt; &gt; jobs,loose Â girlfriend and Â friends. And People tried to kill me. My \n&gt; &gt; ex-girlfriend said my baby it not mine and everyone believes her, so I lost my \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; kid!\n&gt; &gt; Now I am a psychic forÂ adviser network.\n&gt; &gt; Sonny Psychic\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com; RTSC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thu, June 2, 2011 2:54:41 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Riddle me this?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Â  \n&gt; &gt; Â I don&#39;t know how many hundreds of box voices I have posted over the years, \n&gt; &gt;and \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; few if any are heard by anyone, yet if I use other methods, like EVPmaker, or \n&gt; &gt;as \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; recently, just pushing the buttons on my truck radio while recoding,Â  others \n&gt; &gt; hear what I hear. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
