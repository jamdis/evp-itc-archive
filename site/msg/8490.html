Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: New file uploaded to EVP-ITC


          Hi Kristin. I can hear the "yes it does" part. I looked up some of the meanings of the word 
'portal' and found this:

"A portal in fiction is a magical or technological doorway that connects two distant 
locations."

I suppose in this regard the 'ghost boxes' or radios used in sweep with the intent of 
communication could be considered a portal of sorts, but if that is the case, then wouldn't 
our digital recorders (which can be used by those in spirit to produce EVP even when it is 
not our intent) and televisions, camcorders, ordinary cameras, etc (used by those in spirit 
to show their images, again, with our without our intent) also be portals? I recently got an 
EVP voicemail from my next door neighbor's mother, saying her name, and when reversed, 
the message is "I love you." So I guess we'd have to toss telephones and computers onto 
the list as well.

I think the truth is, those in spirit can (and do!) basically go wherever they want, whenever 
they choose, and do not require our permission or our technology to do so. The only thing 
the technology does is allow us to be aware of their presence, which in many cases would 
have gone by unnoticed, if not for our use of the equipment. 

Just my thoughts on the subject. :0)
