<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

Zack, that&#x27;s very cool!

I have over 30 years&#x27; experience as a genealogist. (Yes, it&#x27;s another of my many hats.)  For years, I&#x27;ve been the behind-the-scenes go-to person for professional genealogists to reach a dead end... no pun intended.

So, if I can help you located the 150-year-old record, let me know. I&#x27;d be happy to see what I can, um, dig up.  

If I can contribute that kind of research to this work, I&#x27;m delighted!

Cheerfully,
Fiona

&gt; That&#x27;s all fascinating. It makes sense to me.
&gt; 
&gt; I have gotten several EVP recordings in which a name was given. In all cases
&gt; the name is not a name that was known by any of the living people present
&gt; and there is no particular reason for anyone there to be thinking of that
&gt; name. In one case the name was verified in old records as a person present
&gt; in that location many years ago (but we certainly didn&#x27;t know that at the
&gt; time we were there). In another case we&#x27;re still trying to find out if
&gt; anyone by that name was in that area within the last 150 years.
