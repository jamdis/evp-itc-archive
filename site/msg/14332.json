What ever=\r\n gets us closer to ourselves, and our lost FRIEND&#39;S.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; That&#39;s AL=\r\nL that matters man :) PS...I am a 46 year old male from Iowa. I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; have died and went to the tunnel (when I was 18)...was told &quot;not my time =\r\nto&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; go&quot; by a male voice that echoed (in the darkness). I have s=\r\neen 3 UFO&#39;s in V&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; formation (during Heavens Gate) *2nd comet of=\r\n that year (here in Iowa) I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; have seen 1 &quot;shadow&quot; person (take =\r\n1 step and vanish) touched a ghost (snuck&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; up on it)...got a bu=\r\nrn on tip of my finger where I reached out to touch top&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of it&#39;=\r\ns head (entity was small like child). I have developed 1 xray plate&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; with my finger tips to make multiple white spots in the film-over 20 =\r\nspots&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (naval medical officer was angry when he saw them) hahah=\r\na...he didn&#39;t know I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; did it when his back was turned :) Lot&#39;s =\r\nof fun out here Guy&#39;s (and GALS)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; let&#39;s try and not point finge=\r\nrs now.....Knowbody should feel like they are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; singled out here=\r\n...like I said &quot;none of us &quot;here&quot; have ALL the answers&quot;. So&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;=\r\nm not a total &quot;Newbie&quot;...but I will try a grace yard again someday. And I&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; would hope that people will respect me as well as I...of those =\r\nIN that Grave&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; &gt; Yard. --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-I=\r\nTC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-=\r\nITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;EVP-ITC%&lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://40yahoogroups.com/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;40yahoogroups. co=\r\nm&lt;/A&gt;&gt;, &quot;April \n&lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@&gt=\r\n; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe some ghost hunters assum=\r\ne this, but not us ghost hunters who take&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; our field very serio=\r\nusly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; From: Frank Sumption&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnof=\r\nollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com=\r\n&lt;/A&gt; &lt;EVP-ITC%&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://40yahoogroups.com/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;40yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, M=\r\nay 13, 2009 7:15 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Just wondering=\r\n,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s just an assumtpti=\r\non on most &quot;ghost hunters&quot; part that the dead would&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; be where t=\r\nhey died, or were burried, a Hollywoodism I think.
