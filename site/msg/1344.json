I can hear all those, except the first one.\n\nFrank\n\n\n&gt;From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] New Member and Question\n&gt;Date: Sun, 3 Jun 2007 22:15:52 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt;\n&gt;Yeah I get it with most methods too. I questioned them on that and I was \n&gt;given a couple different responses. Think of it as a group effort, many \n&gt;minds coming together to convey the same thought/words. Sometimes you get \n&gt;the opposite effect where they speak over each other with entirely \n&gt;different words. They also said something about alternate realities echo. \n&gt;But thats too big for my tired brain to think about tonight so I will just \n&gt;attach a few echo topic files here and maybe some of you can hear what I \n&gt;hear and see what they have to say. =)\n&gt;\n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;   PS If you dont see files attached then you dont have individual mail \n&gt;settings turned on for group.\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Hi James;\n&gt;\n&gt;I have gotten that echo wiht almost ever method, EVPmaker, and radio\n&gt;scanning methods, or my boxes, there&#39;s often a pre-echo, and post echo. I\n&gt;don&#39;t know what causes it.\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;delchay2005&quot; &lt;azredant@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] New Member and Question\n&gt; &gt;Date: Sat, 02 Jun 2007 02:03:20 -0000\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Hi Everyone,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;My name is James from Arizona and have about a million questions about\n&gt; &gt;EVP. I am a ghosthunter and I have had great success in recording\n&gt; &gt;EVP&#39;s recently. I have included a link to one of our recent\n&gt; &gt;investigations and recorded an EVP at a restaurant that said &quot;Say\n&gt; &gt;Goodbye!&quot; as an investigator and myself were walking away from the\n&gt; &gt;area.This is an authentic EVP.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;It came from a cassette tape and has not been altered or filtered in\n&gt; &gt;the least. I have been an active ghosthunter for about 3 years now.\n&gt; &gt;Here is the link. Would like to know what you all think of it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;http://www.arizonaparanormalinvestigations.com/MSG.htm\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Question: I am noticing a strange echo reverberation when I record\n&gt; &gt;loud EVP&#39;s. When I record &quot;whisper&quot; type EVP&#39;s I don&#39;t get this echo.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;What do you all think casuses this strange echo quality?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Look forward to talking to all of you!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;James\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get a preview of Live Earth, the hottest event this summer - only on MSN\n&gt;http://liveearth.msn.com?source=msntaglineliveearthhm\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;Be a better Globetrotter.
