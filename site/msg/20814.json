There seems to be othere that have  pridistion as well, but it&#39;s almost as reliable as this stuff. This is from EVPmkaer tonight, using the origianl raw files I used ten years ago. \n&gt;    \n&gt;  &quot;Thanks for writing Frank!  However, it was not me who made the prediction....I was talking about a Christian scholar who has done some research and through his recalculation has determined that the predicted 2012 shift will be occurring around May 17th 2011...he also says this is the date when Jesus will be returning to Earth.  Very interesting, we&#39;ll see......&quot;\n&gt;    \n&gt;   \n&gt;  Soooo, whatever.\n&gt;   \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;   \n&gt;"}
