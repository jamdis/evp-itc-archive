You can=
 create a wave in anything. You can create a wave in a rope by having a per=
son hold each end and then having one person wiggle the rope. You can creat=
e a wave in a lake by dropping a rock into it. The thing that carries the w=
ave is the propagating medium. In these examples it's the rope and water re=
spectively.
=A0
In the case of sound, the propagating medium is the air. It=
 is a longitudinal pressure wave. It cannot be picked up on a receiver that=
 is capable of receiving the same frequencies as electromagnetic waves.
=A0=

There are receivers and antennas that can pick up electromagnetic waves of=
 the same frequencies as sound waves. But in this case, the propagating med=
ium is the aether. They are transverse electromagnetic waves and you can't =
hear them.

The electromagnetic spectrum extends from sub-audible frequenci=
es all the way up to the frequencies of X-rays and cosmic rays. Different m=
ethods exist to detect or receive different parts of this spectrum. I'm inv=
olved in a ULF group that specializes in receiving electromagnetic waves of=
 the Schumann resonances which are around 6 Hz, plus or minus.

Think of microwaves. These are also a type of=

This instance with the recorders =

I am attaching the clip o=

I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic =
wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It works off t=
he heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one an=
other in frequency then if you add or subtract them together you get a beat=
 frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sending a sig=
nal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic =
frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference=A0frequency=
 at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an=
 example, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by=
 turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were generated wi=
thin a few inches of the recorder.
=A0
We are able to reproduce this affect=
 in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and=
 audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio=
 spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
