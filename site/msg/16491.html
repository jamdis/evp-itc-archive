<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for answering me, because I was wondering if the &quot;I love yous&quot; were something characteristic of just the entities I&#x27;m talking to (maybe even the same entity over and over again), or characteristic of most entities in general -- like they have different priorities on what constitutes an important message once a person has died.  For instance, my father I&#x27;m certain would&#x27;ve told me to move the trees I&#x27;d planted over the septic tank, but would&#x27;ve never said &quot;I love you.&quot;  Maybe once he&#x27;s dead, everything looks different to him?  (That&#x27;s providing I&#x27;m really talking to dead people, which I&#x27;m starting to wonder about.)

I&#x27;m also noticing a tendency for the names I&#x27;m getting lately to be Biblical:  Joseph and Michael have come through strongly, and I have no clue who they are.  Maybe they make a name in order to talk to me?

I&#x27;ve also been reading more about how there can be seemingly different groups of entities competing to talk:

I witnessed this, I think, myself when my uncle came through (giving supporting evidence that it truly was him) and I also heard someone say &quot;Get away from me.&quot;  So maybe our dead relatives are indeed there, but other entities, wanting to hog the spotlight, get in the way or skew what our dead relatives say?  Just a thought.

&gt; I get those two. I rarely get last names. names have menaing on this level,
&gt; but none of us are the same person in death, this is just one existence, one
&gt; label or name, or gender, or species(?)

&gt; &gt; So I&#x27;m guessing no one else here gets &quot;I love you&quot; from the entities? It&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; just me? (I&#x27;m just that loveable?)

&gt; &gt; &gt; On New Year&#x27;s Eve and New Year&#x27;s Day I did two sessions with two
&gt; &gt; different sets of participants. The messages always seem to be the same,
&gt; &gt; though: &quot;I love you.&quot; Over and over, threading all through the recording,
&gt; &gt; both in the background, and more overtly when I ask a specific question such
&gt; &gt; as, &quot;Do you have a message for Heather?&quot; Does anyone else get this? I mean,
&gt; &gt; it&#x27;s flattering and all, but it doesn&#x27;t really mean that much when I don&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; know for sure who&#x27;s telling me this.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, &quot;they&quot; seem quite ready to tell me their first names, but almost
&gt; &gt; never their last names. Why? Do last names cease to exist on the other side?
&gt; &gt; Or is there some unwritten rule that says verifiable information can&#x27;t be
&gt; &gt; passed along? If so, who makes and enforces these rules?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; And if they can so easily say a name four times in a row (yesterday it
&gt; &gt; was my friend&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s name Donald), why can&#x27;t they say one word to
&gt; &gt; me that would mean something? Or to my friend Heather? We both asked, and
&gt; &gt; got nothing, at least not that we could discern. It would seem a simple
&gt; &gt; thing to say the word plumber (that was my dad&#x27;s secret word) or some other
&gt; &gt; single-syllable word. Now I&#x27;m pretty sure I really did talk to my dad, as I
&gt; &gt; had another &quot;contact&quot; from him in my waking dream state the other morning,
&gt; &gt; but if it&#x27;s really him, why can&#x27;t he say something he would&#x27;ve said in life?
&gt; &gt; Why do I have the nagging feeling that &quot;they&quot; aren&#x27;t human and never were?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I just don&#x27;t get it! Any thoughts, guys?
