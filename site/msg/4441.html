Oh, Bruce...I agree. Th=
e stuff I have been working on outside this ghost box stuff was completely =
led by "spirits" on the other side. My job, if you will, was to begin a web=
site and build it for the sole purpose of getting others to consider that t=
here might be more than the physical realm. That led to Angels & Ghosts in =
2004, and I had no idea why that name was given, but I went with it. I love=
 the tech side, but have felt the goal of A & G was to make people think an=
d decide for themselves. There are plenty of the debunkers, TAPS type inves=
tigators out there, and that was not the vision I had been given (though I =
like that approach). We recieve submissions from all over the world of audi=
o, pictures, videos, stories, etc, and then I post much if it monthly. Agai=
n, the site's flavor is "you decide." In the digital age, there is no way t=
o authenticate what's absolutely truth, from fiction. So, again my mantra h=
as been, "You decide." Do I think everything on A & G is of ghosts and spir=
its? Nah...not my job to anyway. I make it interesting, and allow the minds=
 of the visitors to decide. That's been my job and the spirits' beckoning. =
They want people to begin looking for more than what the five sense can bri=
