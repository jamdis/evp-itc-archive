&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I was a GB skeptic. I had seen someone doing a presentation, &amp; a bad one at that. I was sure it was fraudulant. So I built one and it took a good many tries. I was about to chuck the thing (It was around 6 or 7 different days we had tried), and me and one of my members picked someone up clear as could be. It was very bizaar. If you want others in the field to respect you do this. Build yourself a box or two. Tape yourself recording over it, over a few months at least. Then present what you have/don&#x27;t have.
&gt; 
&gt; There is so much mud slinging in this community. We should be lifting each other up instead of tearing each other down. However, you have a right to your own opinion, we all do. Just present it logically and with your own evidence. Also posting Franks name and picture is a tad crude. I&#x27;d suggest making your video private until you can present some evidence to support your claims.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know these idiots, but I would suggest you report this to YouTube
&gt; &gt; &gt; since they have your picture up and your name for copyright issues or
&gt; &gt; &gt; slander:
