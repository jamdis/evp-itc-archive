<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t know one way or the other about reincarnation... heard so many sides don&#x27;t know what to believe... but can certainly understand the idea that we would share cellular memories, regardles of whether or not full reincarnation is real... fascinating ideas and possibilities there..

&gt; to  return here over and over again, makes no sense really. 16 people could 
&gt; have  been related to Cleopatra through cell memory, but they all cannot have 
&gt; been  her.  When ones hears about the &quot;long, long line&quot; going from darkness 
&gt; into  the light for all those who may have thought they were going to 
&gt; reincarnate, to  buy Heaven know differently now.  There is a such thing as 
&gt; &quot;incarnation&quot;  but that is far different from reincarnation.  Difference is: with 
&gt; R, they  try to buy the way into Heaven, with In, they are already coming 
&gt; from Heaven  down to help on this side for a purpose, not to try to earn 
&gt; brownie points to  get into Heaven, they come here to attach with other spirits 
&gt; in the body to aid  in some way, or for a Divine purpose. sf

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; When my husband asked whether or not reincarnation is real, he was met with 
&gt;  a slew of &quot;no&quot;&#x27;s. We know better than to believe anything they say one way 
&gt; or  the other, but we do recognize that this is excellent proof of 
&gt; intelligent  communication... how often do you scan the dial and get like five or 
&gt; six  &quot;no&quot;&#x27;s this close together?
&gt; 
&gt; See &quot;reincar-no&quot; file in my folder  &quot;Adriana&#x27;s files&quot; in the files  section.
