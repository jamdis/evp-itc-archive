<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I just got my Joe&#x27;s Box #2 back, which is what i started with and had 
much success.  I did a 10 min. session this morning and only went over 
the first 1 min. so far, but wanted to share a couple.  The &quot;Seven&quot; 
file may be pertaining to the &quot;seven&#x27; we are all getting.  2 good 
messages so far and i haven&#x27;t asked a question yet....Maybe Frank is 
right?  If we listen, maybe they will tell us what we need to know and 
could it be possible that our questions are sidetracking them from 
getting their point across.  Just something to think about.

-Steve H.</pre>
