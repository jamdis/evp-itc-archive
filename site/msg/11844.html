<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I just said that in reference to Al&#x27;s comments. There are a cluster of  
researchers who insist on tagging religious myth on research...  
angels, devils, heaven, hell, assuming anything visiting our plane is  
&quot;stuck&quot; and needs &quot;saving&quot; and ignoring other energies assuming  
everything they hear is or was a human mortal.

Yes, I&#x27;ve heard from many energies claiming to be many things and some  
never having inhabited a body.
