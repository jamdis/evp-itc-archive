That's a good question dbmdude.=C2=A0 The best process I can imagine is, wh=
ether or not you ask questions, to get a group of unbiased people (or as un=
biased as possible) to analyze the results from your session, without any k=
nowledge of what the questions where, and without any knowledge as to what =
you or anyone else thinks the 'voices' are trying to say, only sharing inte=
rpretations once all interpretations are complete. 

Someone biased might b=
e someone who has some kind of stake in finding an intelligence in the reco=
rding, versus someone who doesn't care if one is there not.=C2=A0 For insta=
nce, the person seeking contact with a loved one would be biased.=C2=A0 Or =
someone who makes money off of recording EVP or ITC.=C2=A0 Or someone tryin=
g to produce entertaining content for a tv show.=C2=A0 Or someone who has i=
nvested a lot of their time believing or claiming there are intelligences a=
t work there.=C2=A0 

That is not to say biased people would all be purpose=
ly deceptive.=C2=A0 But, when dealing with such subjective and hard to anal=
yze data, the best process I can imagine would want to remove as much subje=
ctivity and single points of personal 'choice' in interpreation, and impose=
 as much objective analysis and peer review as possible.=C2=A0 While this m=
ight result in much less valid EVPs, I think it would also help to eliminat=
e those EVP methods of less utility, and help the researcher better focus o=
n the methods that really have most promise.

Unless the person doing this =
doesn't really care what others think, or doesn't want to be questioned as =
being wrong, or doesn't want to face the possibility they are making things=
 up.=C2=A0 Then the best process is to just post what they hear, tell peopl=
e what it says before people can interpret the sounds on their own, and ign=
ore or insult those who question them.
