<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ron, it&#x27;s interesting, but I cannot make it out any differently 
than &quot;Evedot.&quot;  Not sure if it is an audio chopped bit or a 
communication of some sort.  ;)

I just uploaded a file from this morning in my folder entitled, spirit-
12808, and it is direct recorded from a 12-470 (older version) piped 
directly into my recorder, but I first added an audio amplifier (into 
the line) to pick up my voice and a head set to adjust both volumes (of 
the radio and the mic) before recording (and to analyze the responses 
in real time).  I basically used Mike Coletta&#x27;s set up he did with the 
ghost box, minus the ghost box and direct recording the session.  
Listen to the audio, as it is much clearer and may provide a better set-
up for adjusting it than direct plugging it into the audio recorder.

Hope this helps.

&gt; I recorded this with a RS 469 patched direct into by handheld 
recorder.  I hear a two sylable word over the background noise.  Hoping 
I can get some help from the group to define the word or words.  
Thanks   Ron L
