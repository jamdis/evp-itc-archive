You just have to go with the voice that sounds out of \n&gt; place most of the time. But than again, they can probably use radio \n&gt; words too. The jury is still out for me on this subject, i don&#39;t \n&gt; know how they do it i just know they do. Maybe Frank knows the \n&gt; answer, he built these things.
