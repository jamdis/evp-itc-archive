It&#39;s what the skeptics a=\r\nnd debunkers tout as the answer to all paranormal experience. I think we ou=\r\nght to pull our claws back in, especially me!&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;I have gotten &quot;voices&quot; that I thought were perfectly clear, and no on=\r\ne else could hear it, and some&nbsp;I found&nbsp;was just&nbsp;a snippet of=\r\n music, so yeah, that happens, but it does not eliminate or explain everyth=\r\ning from the boxes, and other EVP methods, you&nbsp; just have to be aware =\r\nof the possibility. Anotherr problem is broadcast fragments, sometimes they=\r\n are just what they sound like, an ad for one thing or another, sometimes t=\r\nhey can&nbsp;have sychronistic meaning, and sometimes they can be altered i=\r\nn some way to form a messages, such as the recent one I had about learning =\r\nsex, which was seemingly ignored by all cuz it has the &quot;s&quot; word--I guess. T=\r\nhe fragments can also be distorted as the radio tuning is swept across a st=\r\nation, I don&#39;t accept every word and syllable as meaning something. You hav=\r\ne tio judge mnessage by content and personal meaning. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;I have seen faces stand up in a carpet right in front of me,=\r\n not something I just happened across, something that happened live as I wa=\r\ntched. For someone to suggest that&#39;s imagination I find very offensive.&nbs=\r\np; &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;When I first switched to a linear sw=\r\neep in the boxes, I could hear nothing but gibberish, then suddenly&nbsp;I =\r\ncould hear &quot;them&quot;&nbsp;speaking. I doubt that is all imagination either, I =\r\nthink the mind(which is not brain) has to reprogram the ears, which are bra=\r\nin, to hear.&nbsp; I also think the skeptics can not allow this programming=\r\n to take place, hence they can&#39;t hear. I would be very surprised if any of =\r\nthe hard core skeptics even turned on a box for fear that they may hear som=\r\nething that&#39;s not there. Rorke(the Phd) implied as much when he wanted a bo=\r\nx to test, or more&nbsp;like debunk.
