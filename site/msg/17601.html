I am by no means implying that you want to hear this kind of thing! 

But, you are thinking about it at the time of your questioning.  Just that simple act alone may be influencing the outcome of the communication's results.  This is why I question the old trick of asking the box to tell you what is in your hand, because you already know!  I think that the unconscious mind has a lot to do with the communication we receive but I cannot tell you exactly why.
