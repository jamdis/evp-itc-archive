Since day one,\n&gt; one arguement after another over the boxes, what they are for, who can use\n&gt; it, how one jerkoff or another is the master box user and determines who\n&gt; can use the box, and always somebody claims my work no good, while theirs\n&gt; superior.  I&#39;m jumping off this track, ya want it? You got it, someone else\n&gt; can have the loonies, the con men, the tricksters, the posers, and the\n&gt; &quot;ones that know better&quot;. Not getting sucked into the dark with this box\n&gt; crap any longer, it was supposed to be for my own use anyway, y&#39;all simply\n&gt; can&#39;t handle that level of spirit communication. Learned the hard way that\n&gt; there is a reason why certain knowledge is withheld from the uninitiated.\n&gt;  I can&#39;t fix what I have done, all I can do is walk away. Like the guy said\n&gt; &quot;you can&#39;t handle the truth!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Not gonna debate it, been there done that, no one hears or listens,\n&gt; always &quot; Oh, I know so much better&quot; is the response. &quot;For my research&quot;,\n&gt; yeah, heard that about five hundred times!\n&gt;\n&gt;  Time for me to seek the light side of the force--while there is still\n&gt; time.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Frank Sumption\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nDon' do i !On Wed, No 9, 2011 a 12:00 PM, F ank Sump ion pu plealiengi l@...> w o e:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n  Time o me o back he uck up and look in he mi o .
