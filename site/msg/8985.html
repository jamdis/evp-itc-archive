<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce.  That&#x27;s wonderful your are in a financial position to be so generous. :-) 

I don&#x27;t know if we can really go so far as to say that people who buy from eBay are 
receiving units with the wrong kind of energy attached, just because profiting from sales 
isn&#x27;t a course of action you or I, nor some others would take.  If that is the case, where do 
we draw the line?  I paid a hefty price for my MiniBox, as have many others.  I&#x27;m sure there 
is some profit involved there.  The energy of it seems just fine to me and I hold no 
disregard toward Ron for recognizing there is a market for his devices.

Perhaps those who log onto eBay looking to find something so they can experiment with 
automated sweep feel it&#x27;s their lucky day when they discover such a listing?  Maybe they 
even feel it&#x27;s a &#x27;sign&#x27; that it&#x27;s the right thing for them to do some research.  And as far as 
the seller is concerned, we don&#x27;t know what their attitude or motivation is, unless we know 
them personally.  Reminds me of a person on the cleaning crew who used to steal the food 
from the fridge at one of my corporate jobs.  Everyone was so harsh and judgmental about 
it, until one day, we learned she was feeding her hungry children!

Even if the person selling the units is the most greedy person in the world, I fully believe it 
is far more the attitude and intention of the person conducting the experiments which 
influence the energy of communication devices, than the attitude of the people selling the 
devices.  It&#x27;s my opinion WE are the ones who attract what comes through to us on our 
equipment, much more so than the equipment itself.  

Margaret

&gt; Do not give in to these demons that are trying to make a buck from the research we love 
and the equipment we use.
&gt;  
&gt; I have given away including the shipping 5 RS boxes for free, 4, 470&#x27;s and 1 469 all 
hacked by me.
&gt; I did not do it to gain popularity or even wanted a thank you. my sole motivation was to 
bring new people into the research and 
&gt; in turn change someones life and perpetuate the idea of strength in numbers, in this 
case strength of communication.
&gt;  
&gt; To all new people on this board, do not patronise these wolves that prey on the needs 
and wants of others. 
&gt; The RS 20 -125 is everything the 470 &amp; 469 are and a little more. do not let the size or 
complicated button arrangement scare you off.
&gt; the hack is as simple as the others. 
&gt;  
&gt; Do not buy any RS hacks from ebay, they are sold with the wrong energy attached to 
them, spirit wise.
&gt; That is why I and all other researchers should follow the example of a great man to 
whom we owe all of this research.
&gt; Mr. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to make a substantial amount of 
money from his boxes and
&gt; was offered the opportunity on a silver platter. But chose to follow what had been asked 
of him by higher entities.
&gt; And that was to keep the research pure for research sake. And that at no time was this 
equipment or knowledge there of
&gt; to be for monetary gain.
&gt;  
&gt; I adhere to this promise made by Frank to our friends on the other side and feel that 
there is no need to give in to these box 
&gt; extortionists. If a box is not attainable for a new person yet, the right way. Then it 
probably is not their time yet.
&gt;  
&gt; I have coined a phrase and believe in it. &quot;The researcher does not choose the box, the 
box chooses the researcher&quot;
&gt; Be patient, those that do not yet have a box. We will do all we can to help you obtain 
one.

&gt; 
&gt; No bodies at fault, but I would do the hack just to help more people get in this field.  As 
Bruce sayes the more people the better comunication we will have.

&gt; I just took a look at eBay and these are the NEW 12-469&#x27;s. Well, all I can say is the 
market is driven by BUYERS. If people are willing to pay, you can&#x27;t fault the person selling 
for taking advantage of what the market will bear. Perhaps the people who do not have 
the tools, or the skills, to do their own hack, feel this price is reasonable?Margaret--- In
