&gt; April,
&gt;
&gt; I have received EVP&#x27;s during ghost box sessions. One thing that bugs me
&gt; about doing sessions is that you can never be sure whether the clear
&gt; communications received are EVP or box related. It has been shown in studies
&gt; that EVP&#x27;s can be received in a vacuum so even recording a session with
&gt; using the line out may capture EVP&#x27;s (but probably is much less likely to do
&gt; so).
&gt;
&gt; This clip is from June 2009 at Rolling Hills Asylum. I am sure that this is
&gt; an EVP because it my recorder was set up about 12 feet from the shack hack
&gt; and it was the only recorder from that session to pick up this audio. This
&gt; is a genuine Class A EVP, which is a rare thing.
&gt;
&gt; We were conducting a session and you can hear the cycle through ending and
&gt; starting again. We were just about to end the session and had just called
&gt; for any last minute communications when this clip occurred.
&gt;
&gt; I use Google Chrome as a browser, so and it has problems with attachments.
&gt; According to Chrome, the link is here:

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I totally agree. Electronic Voice Phenomena is a completely different
&gt; &gt; animal. That is not to say however that one couldn&#x27;t get an EVP during a
&gt; &gt; ghost box session.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So you have stated that the person conducting this study was an EVP
&gt; expert?
&gt; &gt; &gt; That leads me to question how the study was actually conducted.
&gt; Listening to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the box is certainly not like listening to an EVP and I personally
&gt; disagree
&gt; &gt; &gt; vehemently with the people out there who call box communications EVP&#x27;s!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; In an EVP situation, you are listening closely for a voice to sound
&gt; &gt; &gt; typically over the quiet. A box session forces one to listen through
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; noise as opposed to the silence.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Were these sessions recorded and listened back too or was an analysis
&gt; made
&gt; &gt; &gt; strictly from real time? I do sessions all the time and I am lucky if I
&gt; can
&gt; &gt; &gt; pick up 35% of what comes through in real time.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; And finally, try not to be too dismayed. An EVP &#x27;expert&#x27; makes their
&gt; bread
&gt; &gt; &gt; and butter parading their EVP techniques. I witnessed one such expert
&gt; who we
&gt; &gt; &gt; all have at least heard of create an EVP. How? The person in question
&gt; &gt; &gt; scratched their thumb nail against the recorders mic to create a sound.
&gt; This
&gt; &gt; &gt; person then played back the recorder to me and pitched it down to make
&gt; what
&gt; &gt; &gt; this person say what was heard sound more convincing.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If I made my money parading my EVP ability, I would discredit your box
&gt; too.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why? Because box users are the future of ITC and paranormal research.
&gt; It is
&gt; &gt; &gt; relatively cheap, vastly available, and provides instant gratuity when
&gt; &gt; &gt; operating. Who wants to sit alone in the dark talking to silence when
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; can hear the responses in real time? EVP is still a valid form of
&gt; &gt; &gt; communication, but ghost boxes threaten an EVP experts way to make
&gt; money.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Boxes are being used more and more, especially on the television shows
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; public hunts. This hurts the revenue stream for EVP experts who used to
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; the ones getting invited to guest star on hunts for a fee; they are now
&gt; &gt; &gt; being replaced by box users.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; In short, box use can be discredited by every expert and skeptic in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; field. It doesn&#x27;t matter. Ghost box use now has its place in paranormal
&gt; &gt; &gt; culture and it is not going to leave it anytime soon. Being situated in
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; paranormal group that is lead by a para-celebrity has put me in the
&gt; unique
&gt; &gt; &gt; position of visiting other groups and working with the other
&gt; &gt; &gt; para-celebrities in this field quite frequently. I can assure you that
&gt; ghost
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes aren&#x27;t going anywhere because the majority of these people have
&gt; at
&gt; &gt; &gt; least a shack hack in their paranormal arsenal.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So let this expert discredit to his or her&#x27;s hearts&#x27; content. When they
&gt; &gt; &gt; publish their results, the results become public and they are on the
&gt; hook
&gt; &gt; &gt; for what they say at that point (which could bite them in the ass one
&gt; day).
&gt; &gt; &gt; Their results will not hurt the work that you are doing today Frank,
&gt; nor
&gt; &gt; &gt; will what they say influence this forums core group in any way because
&gt; we
&gt; &gt; &gt; know the boxes work.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#x27;s probably not kosher to post this, but I find this highly
&gt; insulting
&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all of us. As usual, igonore all facts and all other methods, such as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EVPmaker, which forms all the voices inside the computer. Ignore all
&gt; &gt; &gt; phone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EVP messages, ignore all voices heard with no electronic aids. Ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messages received via turned off TV and printers--and on and on, yet
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know all about EVP..Ignore the fact that probably thousands use boxes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; successfully.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep
&gt; EVP
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of
&gt; &gt; &gt; such
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how
&gt; EVP
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; visual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without
&gt; &gt; &gt; solid
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; research supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommend it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conducted by experienced researchers that shows it does produce
&gt; &gt; &gt; phenomena,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we would gladly promote it as an alternative technique.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are pretty sure that, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the
&gt; voice
&gt; &gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; formed in the electronics by transforming available audio-frequency
&gt; noise
&gt; &gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an active part of the electronics such as a transistor junction. We
&gt; think
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the process is amplification of a weak telekinetic signal via
&gt; stochastic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resonance and we have found that the optimum audio-frequency signal
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a chaotic one rich in voice-frequencies with many transient
&gt; &gt; &gt; perturbation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is our working hypothesis. &quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can&#x27;t say who this is from, cuz almost certain I&#x27;d get sued.
&gt; There&#x27;s no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; double blind testing their BS either. Clueless!!
