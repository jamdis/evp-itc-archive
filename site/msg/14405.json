The recording is of a couple messages left on their landline phone\nanswering machine. The messages are mostly garbled and unintelligible. I&#39;ve\ntried every method of processing them to try to bring out the words in the\nmessages, mostly with no luck (that&#39;s how distorted they are.) I was able to\nhear &quot;This is your father ...&quot; in one message and &quot;I love you very much very\nmuch&quot; in another.\n\nThe people suspect the house is haunted by their father and mother, who\nboth passed away within 6 months of these messages. It could very well be.\n\nZack\n\nOn Mon, May 18, 2009 at 12:07 PM, David Koenig\n&lt;floridajakeblues@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree.

There is plenty of other stuff coming through as well,\n&gt;&gt; what do I care if people don&#39;t believe this, I do because, I know this is\n&gt;&gt; meant to be, and I am sure of it it&#39;s going to be something for other&#39;s like\n&gt;&gt; seeing is believing and there is nothing we can do for them, it&#39;s like the\n&gt;&gt; Wright Brother&#39;s flying for the first time here people, they said how in the\n&gt;&gt; world will that big heavy thing get off the ground?  I say lets go for it, a\n&gt;&gt; machine will be found to make them come in loud and clear one day.  sf*\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  In a message dated 5/18/2009 9:13:25 A.M.

Wouldn&#39;t to\n&gt;&gt; much enhancing &quot;taint&quot; the results?  To me the more enhancing you do the\n&gt;&gt; less convincing it becomes.  I hope no one finds this offensive, it is not\n&gt;&gt; meant to be I am just really curious.  The way I look at it is that if you\n&gt;&gt; have to do so much enhancing to find anything, was there really something\n&gt;&gt; there to begin with.  Are we just making ourselves believe there is\n&gt;&gt; something there??\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Eric\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; *A Good Credit Score is 700 or Above.
