I believe the documentary this article references was actually a repeat, an=

Does Nostr=
adamus agree with 
the Mayan calendar about a coming change?

By Stephen Wa=
gner, July 13, 2009

On July 10, 2009, 
The History Channel aired a two-hou=
r documentary on the prophecies of 
Nostradamus and how they might relate t=
o 2012. It was the latest in a growing 
heap of information, theories, fear=
s, warnings, enlightenment and anxiety about 
the year 2012, so perhaps it'=
s time I throw in my two cents. 

I have 
never put much stock in the suppo=
sed Mayan prophecy that 2012 will mark the end 
of the world, the end of an=
 era or however you want to view it. I mean, haven't 
we been through this =
countless times? Some predicted May 5, 2000, as doomsday 
because the plane=
ts were in rough alignment. Then there was the hysteria over 
the millenniu=
m and Y2K. And of course various religious cults have named date 
after dat=
e when the world would surely end, all of which came and went without 
so m=
uch as a hiccup. 

The year 2012 will be no different. Yes, the 
subject is=
 selling a lot of books, drawing large audiences for talk radio and 
counti=
ng up lots of hits on websites, but I think that's the most drama we'll 
ge=
t out of 2012. It, too, will come and go without a major shift on the plane=
t. 
Don't we all really know that? 

Those promoting the 2012 changes have =

thrown out a wide range of possibilities for what might happen =E2=80=93 e=
verything from 
a literal end of the world, to dramatic social, economic, p=
olitical and climatic 
upheaval, to a "spiritual awakening," which, of cour=
se, could mean almost 
anything.
Why 2012?

And what is it based on? Primar=
ily, it's based on an 
ancient Mayan "long count" calendar, carved on stone=
, which according to 
calculations ends on December 21, 2012 and marks the =
end of a 5,126-year era. 
Without a doubt, the ancient Mayans were remarkab=
le mathematicians and 
astronomers, but can we really take this "prophecy" =
seriously? First of all, 
it's not even a prophecy. It happens to be when t=
heir long count calendar ends. 
Why should that hold any significance for u=
s? 

The second reason 
proponents of this coming apocalypse say it is on i=
ts way is that in 2012 there 
will be an alignment of sorts with the center=
 of our galaxy. Because the Earth 
wobbles slowly as it rotates (once about=
 every 26,000 years) the sun will appear 
to rise in alignment with the cen=
ter of the Milky Way. Interesting, yes, but 
there seems to be no cosmologi=
cal evidence of any kind that this should have an 
effect on our planet, ph=
ysically, socially or even spiritually. 

The 
third reason touted is that =
the sun is scheduled to be at a "solar maximum" in 
that year, a time when =
sun spots and solar flares are very active. This kind of 
activity really c=
an cause problems. Such activity can disable and damage 
satellites and can=
 have a dramatic effect on the Earth's weather. The schedule 
is based on p=
ast patterns of such activity, but we have no way of knowing 
whether it wi=
ll happen in 2012, and if it does how severe it might be. 


Strained Inter=
pretations

Back to the Nostradamus documentary for a moment. As 
usual, th=
e Nostradamus experts quoted a selection of his quatrains =E2=80=93 those t=
hat 
feature famine, pestilence, war, etc. =E2=80=93 and strained to tie th=
em into 2012. Not 
successfully, in my opinion. The world has always been p=
lagued with famine, 
pestilence, war and the rest of it, and I saw no quatr=
ain that even remotely 
indicated that what Nostradamus was talking about w=
as the year 
2012.

Aside from the quatrains, the documentary focused mainl=
y on the 
so-called "Lost Book of Nostradamus, " which was discovered in a =
modern 
library in Rome in 1994. Dating to 1629, the manuscript, filled the=
 bright 
watercolor drawings, is titled Nostradamus Vatinicia Code and has =
on the 
inside the name Michel de Notredame as the author. First of all, al=
though this 
"lost book" is thought by some to be the work of Nostradamus, =
there is no 
definitive proof or scholarly consensus that he was actually t=
he author; some 
experts have serious doubts. So to make this book the plat=
form for this 
documentary puts it on very shaky ground. 

And then the len=
gths to which 
the talking heads on the show reached and strained to connec=
t the drawings to 
2012 was positively ludicrous. For example, the drawing =
of a sword, held 
pointing up and around which is looped a banner or scroll=
 (see illustration 
above) =E2=80=93 this was interpreted as the sun's alig=
nment with the galactic center in 
2012. Really? The other drawings were li=
kewise twisted and mangled to fit the 
interpretations needed for the argum=
ent. We all know that we can take such 
enigmatic drawings =E2=80=93 and qu=
atrains =E2=80=93 and interpret them to fit virtually any 
scenario that we=
 want. 

So What Will 
Happen?

Why are some people obsessed with 
2012 (ap=
art from its marketing aspects)? Why are they obsessed with apocalypse 
and=
 the end of the world? Why is it always seen as right around the corner? 

=

I think the answer is that we both fear and want great change. As 
wonderf=
ul as the world can be, it is, as noted earlier, continually plagued by 
wa=
r, economic difficulties, famine and climate shifts. This stuff is not new.=
 
They are continuing problems that ebb and flow on the planet. While we fe=
ar that 
it's going to get worse (and it certainly can get worse), at the s=
ame 
time we have the hope that it's going to get better. We fear the catas=
trophes of 
an apocalypse, yet we hope for that spiritual awakening that wi=
ll save us from 
our own human nature. 

I'm no Nostradamus, but here's my =
prediction for 
2012: the world will continue on pretty much as it has in t=
he past. There will 
be dire problems and there will be great joys. Perhaps=
 some problems will get a 
bit worse than they are right now, but there wil=
l be no earth-shattering 
catastrophe. If there is a spiritual awakening, i=
t won't be on a planetary or 
mass scale through some unspecified miracle, =
as some hope, it will be as 
individuals. (But that has nothing to do with =
2012.) The best we can shoot for 
is that as individuals we do our best to =
make our own small fragments of the 
Earth better places. This has always b=
een the case and ever shall 
be.
