&gt; Yep Steve you are right. I have even tried emailing a few people  
&gt; programs to easily convert them to no avail. Some people just want  
&gt; to ignore what is being said but soon they will have no choice but  
&gt; to listen.

&gt; Misty,
&gt;
&gt; I have and idea. One solution is to post Mp3 files instead of Wav.
&gt; files or any other format. It seems like the Mp3&#x27;s sound the same
&gt; and are only 1/10th of the size. I think that would probably clear
&gt; up 90 percent of the board right there. If i actually have more than
&gt; a couple files from here on out, i will be attaching them to an e-
&gt; mail and not the board to save space here. And also, if people do
&gt; post files maybe we can all just have one post that says we have
&gt; uploaded files to our folder instead of 30 audio announcements in a
&gt; row that just seems to waste a lot of e-mail space in the individual
&gt; e-mails. And it also pushes the current topic on the board to
&gt; another page and is lost for those who wanted to share. Just my
&gt; thoughts on helping the subject. I know we are all excited, but
&gt; misty is right. I went to add a file the other day and the group was
&gt; at 93 percent capacity, so it won&#x27;t be long before we run out of
&gt; space.

&gt; &gt; Just a little friendly reminder that you all need to organize your
&gt; &gt; files better in the files area. Space is limited here and you are
&gt; all
&gt; &gt; nearing the 100% mark so try to keep your section under 5 megs. If
&gt; &gt; you need more space use www.esnips.com and you can store 50 gigs to
&gt; &gt; share with the group or public.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think it is great you guys have so much to share I just wish that
&gt; &gt; our yahoo group wasnt so limited on space (and that I wasnt so
&gt; &gt; limited on time). But I have found a way around it. If just a few
&gt; &gt; people signed up and shared using esnips they can invite others to
&gt; &gt; visit thier files and once they do they also get 50 gigs of free
&gt; &gt; space for audio pictures or video or whatever you want to post.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was considering setting up one &quot;group&quot; account to start with and
&gt; &gt; inviting all members who post files to join it and be able to post
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; the account. It will automatically notify everyone thats a member
&gt; &gt; when a file is added to it just like the yahoo group does. It also
&gt; &gt; allows you to share with the public or privately if you so choose.
&gt; &gt; You can even allow your friends to post to your account if you wish.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This group has grown and expanded and we just need to make a few
&gt; &gt; changes to how we do things to keep it running more smoothly for
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; future. I am hoping that you all will help me in this endeavor. I
&gt; &gt; know many of you have already adapted the idea to help us organize
&gt; &gt; and maintain the group.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I want you to keep sharing and to be able to share more!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So please organize and not post stray files that are targets for
&gt; &gt; deletion once the que is 100% full. And for your own sake, if no
&gt; one
&gt; &gt; elses, be respectful to each other.

&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! Mobile.  
&gt; Try it now.
