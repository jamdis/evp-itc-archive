It was my understanding that the messages come\n&gt; through &quot;whomever&quot; manipulating the radio voices as it rapidly goes\n&gt; from station to station. I&#39;m just recording what comes through the\n&gt; radio.\n&gt;\n&gt; Am I leaving out some important step?\n&gt;\n&gt; ~Elabeth\n&gt;"}
