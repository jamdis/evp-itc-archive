<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Supposedly. I&#x27;ve tried watching it, but it&#x27;s not working. I&#x27;m at work so I don&#x27;t know if the feed is just being blocked or what. They have an EVP lecture tomorrow and I think it would be interesting to ask a question and see what they have to say about what we&#x27;re doing.

&gt; I tried sending this yesterday (Friday), but I guess it didn&#x27;t go through. &quot;I know how some people feel about the TAPS guys, but is anyone going to TAPSCON ( http://tapscon.com/ ) in Clearwater, Florida this weekend? I can&#x27;t make it on Saturday, since I have to work, but I&#x27;m thinking about going on Sunday. If you go to the site it has a live feed (which I plan to watch at work) and its venue, etc. There&#x27;s going to be all kinds of different stuff, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the money. I think it&#x27;d be interesting to go though.&quot;
