Here is one from the neighbors grandpa or father which died a few years  
ago, I can't very well go next door and tell the neighbor that his granddad or 
 dad came through calling his name, telling him he loves him, although he  
probably would appreciate it, he would also think me nuts.  Some guy at the  
end saying his name as Jerry, then a fella saying" rabbit creek."  I know  
his dad, "jack" was a trapper for awhile, but he built some natural dens for 
 rabbits, beaver, and fox, he liked to hunt deer and bear, but all the deer 
were  coming over here, so he gave that up, and was no longer hunting his 
own land  next door.  Jack was just a young guy when he got cancer and died 
few years  ago, a couple years after my mom died.  I have more files but i 
got to make  them louder seems they don't play as loud unless i make them 
louder with  goldwave program.
