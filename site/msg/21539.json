I for one, don&#39;t post because I have nothing valuable to contribute.  I am very interested in\n&gt; communication from the spirit world. And read all the posts with interest; But I work full time and don&#39;t \n&gt; have the time to spend right now in learning and developing my interest. Maybe someday I&#39;ll be able to\n&gt; retire and be able to devote more time. But I  also know once I got started , I would become too engrossed and\n&gt; probably neglect other areas of my life. This Forum is one way for me to keep the door open, when I&#39;m ready.\n&gt; So all your posts are read and appreciated by me, even tho I don&#39;t contribute.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; IS THIS WHERE YOU LIVE? \n&gt; &quot;No, I live in heaven, and my affections\n&gt; are there.
