<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Oops! I didn&#x27;t see the price till now. I told hubby it would run around $200.00. I must&#x27;ve seen something that wasn&#x27;t 3. Maybe Spectrecam 1 or 2? I&#x27;d LOVE to have a &quot;3&quot;. If I have to buy everything separate, it will  probably run over $400.00. I know my husband can&#x27;t afford that. He was really slurging with a $200.00 camera.

You definately have me wanting one of these now though. If I could get someone around here to buy my home gym, that would help alot.
