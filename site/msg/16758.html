<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>If you could get some info from Walter about his life that you had no way of knowing, and then were able to verify that info, I would be REALLY interested in hearing about that.  These entities lie so very much, I would love to hear about one that didn&#x27;t.  Please keep us posted, OK?

&gt; Hello, 
&gt; I have been sitting on the side reading the post to this group for a while now.  I did have a strong interest in the &quot;box&quot; since I do belong to a paranormal investigation group.  About a month I decided to build a &quot;box&quot;  Mine uses a radio shack radio,  mp3 white noise generator, and a listen up amplfyer all enclosed in a box. I first tried the am band what I got was scratchy but I definately got cussed out.  Later I tried AM band and got answers to questions,  the voice was so clear it did not even seem to be coming from the blips from the sweeping radio.  THe voice told me to check on my sister, and called her name, saying she was sick.  Actually she was sick and had just gotten back from the hospital the day before.  The voice gave me the name of Walter, and said he like to visit me due to me having EMF meters and such, making it possible for me to know when he came around.  I has on several occasions smelled cigarette smoke, and upon asking Walter if he smoked, and had smoked around me he answered yes.  He further said he was from the small town where I live, and had been born and raised there.  He also said he knew my whole family here.  The most interesting thing is a man named Walter lived on the street behind where I live, and died back in the sixties.
&gt; Anyway I was a skeptic concerning real time EVP&#x27;s, but the results I have gotten thus far are quite Impressive.
