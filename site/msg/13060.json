This is not a test, just a means of gathering \naudio with the use of material associated with a plane crash, at a \nlocation other than where the crash happened.\n\nAll I asked them to do is provide five, 30 second audio files which \nthey record while using the pieces of debris I will be sending them.\nI have faith in the researchers on this forum who have volunteered \n(six people so far have been selected).  \n\nWhatever is found on the audio files will be studied, and since I \nwill be the one listening to the recordings, and since I already know \nall the details of the incident, I have not set my mind to \npredetermine anything.\n\nYes, a different type of test could have been done, and I could have \nhidden all information, but that would not have mattered for this \neffort, since the outcome is to only get the audio files, what ever \nmay be found on them.\n\nThanks to those who have volunteered, I cound still use four more \npeople too.\n\n- Mike C.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Cheri Esperon &lt;cesperon@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have to agree with Rick, the less information in a situation like \n&gt; this- the better.  When we do investigations, I supply very little \n&gt; information to my team, as a matter of fact, I prefer to be kept in \nthe \n&gt; dark (no pun intended) as much as possible myself.    This type of \n&gt; phenomenon is common in many fields, it is simply the power of \n&gt; suggestion, there are hundreds of document cases where a well \nmeaning \n&gt; witness who truly wants to provide accurate & honest information, \ncan be \n&gt; led by innocent suggestions.\n&gt; \n&gt; A really really good example of this is Derren Brown.   Watch this \n&gt; video...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQjr1YL0zg     Of \ncourse, I \n&gt; don&#39;t think Rick nor anyone was suggesting you would intentionally \nlead \n&gt; anyone, but it is sooo easy to do so.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; David Koenig wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You seem to be assuming a built in prejudice amongst the \nexperimenters \n&gt; &gt; here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Thu, Dec 11, 2008 at 1:32 PM, Rick &lt;rasterer@... \n&gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:rasterer@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Prejudice refers to prejudgment.

Now\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; that everyone knows they are from a plane crash, that \nwill set\n&gt; &gt;     up the\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; prejudice of hearing plane/travel related words in the \nevp noises.\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; And as you probably know, once that prejudice is active, \nonce\n&gt; &gt;     I say\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; &quot;Doesn&#39;t that sound like someone saying\n&gt; &gt;     &quot;Sssssstewardesssss...&quot;, then\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; everyone hears THAT word, rather than just noise, or, for \nexample\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; &quot;Stewed ass&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; And, if something does sound like a plane/travel related \nword, it\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; will now be highlighted as an example of why this was a \nsuccessful\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; test, and the other less-relevant words ignored. This is \na form of\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; confirmation bias, which again, hurts the value of the \ntest.\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; A more objective way would have been to send out both \ncrash\n&gt; &gt;     related\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; items, and completely innocuous items, with no \nexplanation of\n&gt; &gt;     where\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; each was from, and see what kind of EVPs were returned on \neach.\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; Further, the returned EVPs should then be returned to \nsomeone to\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; evaluate who ALSO doesn&#39;t know the origin of the objects, \nso that\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; they do not torture the interpretations into the forms you\n&gt; &gt;     hope and\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; expect them to be (again, plane/travel related). While \nthis\n&gt; &gt;     test of\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; course lacks all kinds of controls, this would at least \nbe a\n&gt; &gt;     start to\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; defining a double-blind test, which is the gold standard \nfor good\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; research in this kind of research.\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; Even though you have tried to keep some of the \ninformation quiet,\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; there is still quite a large opportunity for guessing and\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; coincidence. For example, one person might assume this \nwas from an\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; airshow (since, as you said, the event was very fast, and \nmany\n&gt; &gt;     people\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; saw it), and so only send in EVPs that would be relevant \nto that\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; situation (I.e. Not sending in child-like sounds, or \nsending in\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; sounds that sound like scratchy tower or inter-plane\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; communication). If the crash was a commercial airline, \nthen dozens\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; of different people could have been killed, which means \nyou could\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; find SOME relevancy no matter what noises are returned to \nyou:\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; practical any word, name, or sound will support some\n&gt; &gt;     speculation that\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; it could have been relevant to one of those people.\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; I do think it is a good idea to test your theories. But \nmy purpose\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; here is to suggest ways to help these tests be as \nobjective as\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; possible, and for your efforts and testing to be as worth \nwhile as\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; possible, and for the youtube video results you make to \nbe as\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; valuable and bulletproof as possible. But I am concerned \nthat the\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; above scenario is full of opportunity for subjectivity and\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; misinterpretation.\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
