Anything over 50 or 100kb has \nto be linked to?  This way we will cut down on the file strain \nwithout having to convert to mp3.  Many of the mp3 files are massive \nhere.  My wav files are smaller...plus the mp3s don&#39;t open up \ncorrectly for some of us.\n\nI requested this yesterday, but it surely got lost in the fireworks.  \nI have deleted some of my files, as well.  \n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@...m, &quot;lisbyfarrum&quot; &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Deleting my files took it down about 3 percent, I noticed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I have been sick and I&#39;m plain worn down to a nub with all this\n&gt; fighting.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do appreciate you asking after me, Misty. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll be around.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Misty&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks Ann. I think going to more compacted files will help us \nall in \n&gt; &gt; the long run. We are already back to 72% rather than 96% tho most \nof \n&gt; &gt; the file space was being used by someone else besides you =)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know it gets to be a bit testy around here and the other \nforums. I \n&gt; &gt; also know that some of the nastiness can tear apart good working \n&gt; &gt; relationships as well as friendships. I was just askin Frank if \nhe \n&gt; &gt; knew if you were still sick or not because you had been very \nquiet \n&gt; &gt; lately.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I agree sometimes its good to take a step back rather than get \n&gt; &gt; yourself caught up in the drama fests going on around us all. \nThats \n&gt; &gt; on and off the board as well. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I said I know some of what goes on off of this forum, and I am \nsad \n&gt; &gt; to see most of it happening. I just hope everyone can regain \nfocus \n&gt; &gt; and like you said, remember why we are here.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope you feel better soon, and rejoin us when the stress level \nis \n&gt; &gt; passed. And I hope it passes soon so ya can run some test \nsessions \n&gt; &gt; with the new tool that arrived!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I keep telling people that all the negativity does take a toll, \non us \n&gt; &gt; personally and our working together. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Misty\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get a grip--all of you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m out of here until all this petty BS and hatred sorts out. \nThe  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; amount of stress that I&#39;ve been through with all this fighting \n&gt; &gt; since  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; early this year has really taken a toll on me as a person and \na  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; researcher.
