<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for the clarification, Rosemary and April.

I just got great news! Ron&#x27;s personally going to be bringing to my 
new Mini to the DAPS group meeting next Tuesday!! 

I&#x27;ve heard such positive feedback, from him and others, I can&#x27;t wait 
to start experimenting. 

As positive communications with the Mini are established, I&#x27;ll make 
sure other researchers are in the loop.

&gt; On the specs side, the MiniBox has controls for both scan rate as 
well
&gt; as sensitivity, so you can cut down on the amount of random noise 
and
&gt; also find a speed which seems clearer, whereas you cannot with the 
RS
&gt; Hack (as far as I know). The rechargeable battery lasts about 40-50
&gt; hours on one charge... nothing to replace that way. It has both a
&gt; speaker output and one for a recorder so you can not only hear it as
&gt; loud as you like, but you can directly record your session from the 
box.  
&gt; 
&gt; When it comes to audible differences, the quality of the electronics
&gt; used provides clearer sound. I am not straining so much to hear
&gt; things. It is just speculation on my part, but it seems to take less
&gt; time and less effort for communication from the other side to come
&gt; through with the Mini. At least, in my experiences with both 
devices.
&gt; Though, I have gotten snippets from the RS Hack that were 
impressive.
