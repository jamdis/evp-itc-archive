<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The guy obviously knows nothing about TV.  I do.  There&#x27;s no way that 
image could&#x27;ve been generated naturally.

Remember the old days when TV&#x27;s had tuning knobs?  You could adjust it so 
you had the best picture. Or tune it completely off-channel.  Modern ones 
just don&#x27;t work that way.

Somewhere in my junquebox I still have an ancient UHF converter from the 
early days of UHF, when most TV&#x27;s didn&#x27;t have it.  You set your TV to 
channel 2, I believe, and turned a knob on the front to tune in UHF 
stations.

&gt; I slowed down the Sweet Jesus voice. and

&gt; &quot;The problem with this sort of thing is that it requires a detailed technical knowledge to decide what is normal expected behaviour for a detuned TV and what is genuinely odd. While there is lot of information available on the proper normal function of a tuned TV there is little about what badly tuned TVs do! In this case, it looks as though the two images may be from different slightly different times. I?m not an expert in TV operation so I don?t know if this is expected behaviour for detuned TVs. From a little research, it seems likely that the horizontal retrace signals are getting screwed up, due to the bad reception, meaning the screen is not updating correctly, leaving old signals still visible. It would be well worth researching this subject.&quot;
