<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>When he hell did you get an electronic engineering degree!? I was not interested in a circuit that only simulaters random sweep. You take everything I say, turn it all around and insult me over an over, in public, using my work to make a name for yourself. Now you claim I ripped off some one else, you lying piece of shit!!



 Screw warnings, I&#x27;ve had it with this clown. I still have the banned button!!

&gt; It was named that, because i have several recordings of Edison speaking through the boxes.  I also believe that he had helped me produce my own version of the box, given the fact i had no electronics background.
&gt; 
&gt; It has nothing to do with Edison building a box of his own, not that i need to explain anything to you about why i did what i did.
&gt; 
&gt; I am aware of all that frank mentioned in his post about the history of ITC, i&#x27;ve been researching all of this for the past 5 or 6 years.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that frank cannot get a random circuit to work, but i have offered to help several times.  I believe his answer was &quot;Bite Me&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I will upload the video next of the random circuit on the scope as requested by frank.  It is not hard to get a working random circuit or a clear sounding ghost box, just have to use good parts.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m glad that frank was able to copy somebody else&#x27;s work to make this a popular subject in the field.  If he didn&#x27;t take the idea of a sweeping radio, none of us would be here right now.
&gt; 
&gt; I would never try to remove frank from box history, my box #39 from frank is still my favorite box to use.

&gt; &gt; Not to mention that Edison never built his spirit phone.  He only theorized that such a device *could* be built.  People really need to do 15 mins worth of research before naming these things :))

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For the record, I correct everyone around me that call them anything but Frank&#x27;s box.

&gt; &gt;   
&gt; &gt; 1-Calling an Edison box is sham and scam. A way of trying to lend credbility to it, and remove me from box history, and it does look suspicioulsy like what I make. It is also ignoring all EVI-ITC history of the last one hundred years. How many here realize the ghost box, or radio sweep method used to be called Direct Radio Voice, and has long history? I have never heard any stories of Edison getting radio contacts wioht spirit.
&gt; &gt; How many have even done five minutes of research on the history of EVP. I can tell ya, none! No, y&#x27;all want to sit in the dark and ask what color your shirt is then claim to be great researchers and experts. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2-I doubt that it truely random, I&#x27;d like to see a scope vid of the sweep modes. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I wouldn&#x27;t have problem, but these people like the one putting on this video belittle and insult me in public. For what? For their own fame and fortune. Then try to copy Chirs Moon, and blame the concept on Edison--freaking clueless, all of you!

&gt; &gt; &gt; This video explains all the features of the box.  So, get some popcorn and enjoy.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is the first box to have shack hack modes as well as linear and random adjustable sweeps.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, the only box other than the &quot;Minibox&quot; to have a working random circuit in it.
