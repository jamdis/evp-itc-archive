I am\nthinking about using wood for the casing and then building a rather\nmore advanced version is the prototype if it shows promise. \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Laura Kimberley&quot; &lt;itcnap@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s great. Do you have a proto type built?\n&gt; \n&gt;  I would enjoy testing it for you! \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, please send me your designs would enjoy looking them over.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; LK\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of\n&gt; seanjankowski1\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 25, 2008 8:11 AM\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] All In One Device\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; This is my first post. I was wondering if anyone had created an all in\n&gt; one ITC EVP device. I know that researchers such as Seidle had created\n&gt; the psychophone that seemed to cover many aspects of ITC but I have\n&gt; yet to see all ways of communication in one device.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have created an all in one design that covers most of the devices\n&gt; used. If you wish I will share the design.\n&gt;"}
