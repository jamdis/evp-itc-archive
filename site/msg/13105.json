Many of the data being recorded in ITC sessions is in DIRECT answer to the questions being posed. The same can be said of the EVP people are recording as well... Also, there are characteristics of the EVP that in my opinion set them apart from stray radio signals... one is the distinct monotone or &quot;other wordly&quot; sound of the EVP... also, many people record a popping sound seconds before the EVP is recorded...  As far as digital recorders go. I don&#39;t think anyone has conducted an independent study of which brands are more suseptible to radio interference than others. I think that would have less to do with make and brand and more to do with the the power of a particular 2-way radio...

That way we know where everyone is at all times. So far this\n&gt; has been successful for us. This method assumes a level of\n&gt; responsibility and respect on the part of the investigators - I have\n&gt; found that if you are doing an event where others and the public are\n&gt; invited it is essential to have them see the schedule and agree to\n&gt; abide by it when they sign up and then again when they arrive.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Laurie\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Luis Gonzalez&quot; &lt;almovadar@. ..&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, December 13, 2008 11:40pm\n&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Of Radio Interference and equipment...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tom,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I own a Motorola Razor.

This false positive\n&gt; reading led me to make sure that everyones phone was instead turned\n&gt; off entirely.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have also recieved radio interference or bleed over from other\n&gt; two-way radios in the area that can be confused as EVP if not\n&gt; mentioned when recording audio.

I&#39;m sure my\n&gt; colleagues in the Gettysburg area would agree with me ... but I also\n&gt; hear from my friend Bill Murphy that many have resorted to hand held\n&gt; GPS systems to mark particular areas of interest when conducting EVP\n&gt; or ITC sessions in the field...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Louis\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- On Sat, 12/13/08, Tom Arnold &lt;topgun0123@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From: Tom Arnold &lt;topgun0123@ ...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC]cpl question for team investigators\n&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;&gt; Date: Saturday, December 13, 2008, 6:34 PM\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have never have had our radios mess with equipment.Cell phones\n&gt; never off on vibrate.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- On Sat, 12/13/08, Rick &lt;rasterer@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From: Rick &lt;rasterer@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC]cpl question for team investigators\n&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;&gt; Date: Saturday, December 13, 2008, 2:27 PM\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That&#39;s interesting Laurie.

Ive never been on an investigation with a team so\n&gt;&gt; Im kinda curious how different groups work and run things.(wish I knew\n&gt;&gt; people in arizona I could go on an investigation with) I know when I\n&gt;&gt; do my research here with my radio shack hack I always say thanks and\n&gt;&gt; am polite and have never freaked out or cussed in response to one of\n&gt;&gt; the responses Ive gotten.
