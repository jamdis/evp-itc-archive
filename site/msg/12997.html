<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Maybe your right :) Who is craziest though...the crazy person or the 
person that stays with the crazy person?  

I will add that she knew about them and I told her about them before I 
asked her to leave. Besides the gadgets weren&#x27;t strictly for her, they 
were for the weirdness at the new apartment. But thanks for the shallow 
help.

&gt; It sounds like you seriously need some professional help. Anyone who  
&gt; would not only stay with someone like you describe, but go to the  
&gt; length you have with spying has some serious issues that no one on  
&gt; this list can advise you with. My suggestion, and I&#x27;m extremely  
&gt; serious, is that you get some professional psychological help and 
quick.
