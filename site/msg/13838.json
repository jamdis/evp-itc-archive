Asking for a specific, predetermined number \n        is not subjecti=\r\nve.&nbsp; It is about as objective as you can get. \n        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am no=\r\nt trying to prove anything, or rule out any \n        possibilities.&nbsp; I=\r\n am suggesting a method to determine, \n        statistically, how accurate =\r\nsomeone=E2=80=99s board, or methodology, might \n        be.&nbsp; Lets say =\r\nI select two people, and in separate rooms, I give \n        each a spelling=\r\n test.&nbsp; Person 1 gets 100% right.&nbsp; Person 2 \n        gets 50% rig=\r\nht.&nbsp; Now, if I later give them a second spelling test, \n        I can =\r\nstart with the theory that Person 1 will get near 100% correct, \n        an=\r\nd Person 2 will get near 50% correct.&nbsp; This doesn=E2=80=99t mean they =\r\n\n        will, or that they have gotten these scores in the past.&nbsp; But=\r\n \n        statistically, it is a reasonable assumption at this point.&nbsp;=\r\n After \n        the second test, I can examine the deviation of the results=\r\n from the \n        first test, and update the statistics.&nbsp;&nbsp; If th=\r\ne deviation \n        remains small (if the results remain similar), then I =\r\ncan more and more \n        safely assume that person 1 will have a very hig=\r\nh chance of getting a \n        word right, and person 2 will have half that=\r\n.&nbsp; If the deviation \n        swings wildly, than my statistics may not=\r\n be very predictive after \n        all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The same is true with the bo=\r\nard.&nbsp; As you said, getting \n        this number wrong doesn=E2=80=99t =\r\nsay past answers were wrong, or that future \n        answers will be wrong.=\r\n&nbsp; And it is possible it could have been right \n        by mere chance =\r\n(though very unlikely: winning the lottery is more likely \n        than gue=\r\nssing one number out of a billion).&nbsp; What we=E2=80=99d have is one \n  =\r\n      single objective data point.&nbsp; It gives a starting point for \n   =\r\n     reasonable assumptions.&nbsp; As you noted, after more such tests, tho=\r\nse \n        assumptions may start changing.&nbsp; It would be interesting t=\r\no see how \n        they change, if they do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Different people seem to=\r\n have different \n        feelings about the board.&nbsp; Some believe it gi=\r\nves great \n        results.&nbsp; Some are suspicious, even dubious.&nbsp; =\r\nAnd there are \n        plenty of opinions in between.&nbsp; My test is not =\r\nfor those who \n        believe it is statistically likely that psychic tamp=\r\nering would occur, \n        or that the board=E2=80=99s performance is just=\r\n not testable, which is the camp \n        I gather you are in.&nbsp; My tes=\r\nt is only good for that segment of this \n        population who believes or=\r\n wonders if the board is capable of giving a \n        straight objective an=\r\nswer to a straight objective questions, and that \n        such performance =\r\nis testable.&nbsp; To address one of your examples, \n        while it canno=\r\nt show that an entity is reading my mind if it gets the \n        numbers ri=\r\nght, it can conversely show that an actual entity is not \n        reading m=\r\ny mind (or that it is not performing remote viewing, or that it \n        is=\r\n not predicting the future of what the right answer is when it is \n        =\r\nrevealed, or that it is not being forthright in its answers) if it \n       =\r\n cannot get the numbers right in the first place.&nbsp; But if these \n     =\r\n   things are true, then it begs the question of its accuracy \n        anyw=\r\nay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So again, this is one data point, in what could be a \n        nu=\r\nmber of tests, for those who are not ruling out that testing is \n        po=\r\nssible, and even desirable, when believing, or acting on, information \n    =\r\n    gathered by using this kind of board.&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Wed, =\r\n\n        4/15/09, April Abercrombie \n        &lt;i&gt;&lt;april@abercrombiegh ost=\r\nresearch. com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; \n        wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;=\r\nborder-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: \n          April Abercr=\r\nombie \n          &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: R=\r\ne: \n          [EVP-ITC] Re: An alternative to the usual ghost hunter stuff.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;To: \n          EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;br&gt;Date: Wednesday, April 15, 2=\r\n009, 2:45 \n          PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n          &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1815592389&quot;&gt;\n      =\r\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;M=\r\nyriad Pro&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to test \n          it,&nbs=\r\np;it is that I can&#39;t.
