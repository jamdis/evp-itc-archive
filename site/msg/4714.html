<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Perhaps I should have been more specific.

Ominous--in reference to the people speaking through the box not  
being our loved ones who are &quot;somewhere else.&quot;

&gt; Ominous?  It depends on which side of the fence your on?  I have  
&gt; been in a position
&gt; of asking for Angels / Gods protection after sensing what was  
&gt; perceived as evil.
&gt; Good and evil / Light &amp; darkness can not exist in the same space.  
&gt; You can&#x27;t have
&gt; one without the other. Negativity will always be overpowered by  
&gt; Good &amp; darkness
&gt; will always be illuminated by the light.  Negative entities will  
&gt; try to lie and / or mislead?
&gt; You can&#x27;t always know who your dealing with, but that&#x27;s part of the  
&gt; investigating process,
&gt; isn&#x27;t it?  Asking &amp; Trying to determine who your dealing with?

&gt; That  sounds quite ominous, Zack. Not sure I like the sound of it.  
&gt; What is your theory?

&gt;&gt; We actually don&#x27;t know who we&#x27;re communicating with using the  
&gt;&gt; boxes. I
&gt;&gt; suspect it isn&#x27;t what we traditionally call a &quot;ghost&quot;.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I also suspect that people are not hearing their loved ones. The  
&gt;&gt; loved
&gt;&gt; oneshave probably been elsewhere for some time ...

&gt;&gt; &gt; I personally have seen Chris use his box in public forum four  
&gt;&gt; times.
&gt;&gt; &gt; I have heard the box give audible yes and no type answers to  
&gt;&gt; peoples
&gt;&gt; &gt; questions. I do feel though that the ones that get emotionally  
&gt;&gt; moved
&gt;&gt; &gt; the most are the ones wanting with all their heart to hear from a
&gt;&gt; &gt; loved one. When these people get an answer that may or may not be
&gt;&gt; &gt; heard by all, they feel that it is indeed from a loved one and it
&gt;&gt; &gt; hits them in the heart as if it was real. I would love to hear a
&gt;&gt; &gt; recorded session from start to finish as an investigator. After all
&gt;&gt; &gt; this research is for all not just &quot;30&quot;.... :-)
