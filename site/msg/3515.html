&gt; I for one appreciate the openness and the willingness of this group of
&gt; people to open up the technology to anyone and everyone willing to put in
&gt; the time and effort that is so blatantly needed.  I don&#x27;t know Chris Moon
&gt; but I have heard him on C2C and have read his opinions.  I am always weary
&gt; of anyone claiming to be one of a &quot;chosen few&quot; and using fear to further
&gt; their arguments.  
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; The fear-based reasoning&#x27;s and omni-potent subterfuge employed by Mr. Moon
&gt; only tells me to ignore him and anyone else like him.  There is no manual or
&gt; class  this research is done by Joe-Schmo in his basement and therefore
&gt; open to many different interpretations and methodologies.  Take the good 
&gt; delete the bad.  I believe in Karma  even if she is only my dog digging in
&gt; my garden :-)

&gt; 
&gt; Hi All;
&gt;  
&gt;  First, the thing, the equiment I make, and experiment with as a device for
&gt; ITC, Instrumental Trans-Communication, also now know as Franks&#x27; Box, or the
&gt; Ghost box (that&#x27;s also an audio devioce,a nd photography device) was never
&gt; described by me, it&#x27;s inverntor, as the &quot;Telephone to the Dead&quot;, that label
&gt; was put on my equipment, loaned to Moon for testing, he was the first to
&gt; want to test the box, he is not, and was not designated by me as the
&gt; &quot;primary tester&quot;.  In fact he has yet to pay anything for the boxes he has,
&gt; or any of the other equipment he &quot;barrowed&quot;, such as the Sony pocket size
&gt; cassette recorder, and Tarot CD, he still has. Moon is the one that claims
&gt; only he, or a designated trainee can properly interpret the output of the
&gt; box, despite the fact that I have stated numerous times that I made the box
&gt; for anyone to use, and one&#x27;s results are any no better or supercede in
&gt; anyway the results of anyone else. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Now when someone claims that these new system don&#x27;t work, or only get the
&gt; evil spirits, and even open portals so demons, or what not can enter, they
&gt; are lying, and attempting to keep the use of any equipment,  and methods of
&gt; spirit communication for themselves. The motive being priofit,a s far as I
&gt; can tell. The portal thing is Hollywood! I use my equimpemt in my basement,.
&gt; and have sinece 2000, amnd have never expereinced anything I could call evil
&gt; beside soem cussing, nakme calling voices, which is hardly threatening
&gt; except to maybe 13 year old girl. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I must point put, because of preivisou threats, that slander is stating
&gt; something in public about a person that is knowingly untrue. So for anyone
&gt; comptemplating such threats I can say only-- Bring It, I will have
&gt; everything you own!

Put him &quot;out of business&quot; in making money/profits from YOUR box! This seem unethical in what he&#x27;s now doing, don&#x27;t ya think?   My 2c worth.  Makes me annoyed!  =Judy=                           . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</pre>
