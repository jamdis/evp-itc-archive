Thanks to ALL of you!\n&gt; \n&gt; Now... I&#39;ve decided to try out a bit of ITC.\n&gt; Okay... for those of you interested, I&#39;ve put out (oh\n&gt; no, not another \n&gt; video), yes... another video.\n&gt; It can be seen at my website:\n&gt; http://www.ufomagazine.net\n&gt; or on YouTube at:\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S-4e-wxd6U\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks... and have a very paranormal day!\n&gt; - Mike Coletta (UFO Geek)\n&gt; Unidentified Frequency Oscillations (UFO) Magazine\n&gt; UFOMagazine.net"}
