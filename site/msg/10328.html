<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Huh!? I can only say, I don&#x27;t have to do this group thing either, I 
stay cuz a few request it. The guys actually talk more if I don&#x27;t 
share. 

 I can understand where Bruce was coming fom, to a point, but when 
you start making threatening private e-mails to make sure everyone 
agrees with you, that&#x27;s just demented and wrong. This shit ain&#x27;t 
that important!

self. And can aid you with your spiritual insight, growth and 
travels on the astral planes.
