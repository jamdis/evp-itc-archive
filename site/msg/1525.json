I made two of these boxes in a \nttempt to make them smaller, and portable. The number a the begiing is \nusually the order received or heard. The other one is AM/FM, but the AM \ntuner takes a screwy tuning voltage, so it doens&#39;t work right. I want to \njust add a different AM tuner, and keep the FM tuner. That one has the steel \nbox too, but I don&#39;t remember if it&#39;s the wave guide box.\n\nAll of the later Boxes are made so the Echo box can be easily replaced, and \nsome have front panel jacks to allow the use of other echo boxes. I quite \nputting in those jacks, as most had no understanding of their use, even if I \nexplained it.\n\nFrank-S\n\n\n\n\n&gt;From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Box 12\n&gt;Date: Wed, 11 Jul 2007 22:06:58 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt;\n&gt;#13 Doesnt look so ugly to me Frank. I think it would be cool if it had the \n&gt;option for both but not a necessity. Is #12 the one you got my name/voice \n&gt;on? &quot;this is Misty Dawn&quot; I still have that sound clip saved hehehe I cant \n&gt;remember but the sound files had 12 at the start of it and i think thats \n&gt;how you were numbering them at one point. I kinda remember 13&#39;s tests but \n&gt;it wasnt around long enough to gather much info. Was around the time when \n&gt;we tested video itc.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Anyway heres the that file from that box 12 if it was indeed as labled. \n&gt;Oh and if it is 12 then when u fix that one let&#39;s play with it a bit before \n&gt;it goes anywhere LOL.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           This is a box returned. I replaced the capacitors in the whithe \n&gt;noise amp\n&gt;that control the gain, and voila--kick butt box. This is one of two that I\n&gt;tried &quot;ugly construction&quot;, where the components are mounted on an unetched\n&gt;piece of copper clad board in an effort to reduce size. One drawback with\n&gt;this box is it&#39;s AC powered, so not portable to places wihtout power--like\n&gt;grave yards, so I might convert it. I have one more of these, #12, but the\n&gt;tuner needs to be replaced.\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________________\n&gt;Don&#39;t get caught with egg on your face.
