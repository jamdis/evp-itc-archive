I think part of the animosity between the scientist/skeptic and the paranor=
malist/believer, is that they are speaking a different language, and often =
don=E2=80=99t know it.



Both come up with theories. =C2=A0And these may l=
ead to conclusions. =C2=A0A scientist frames this as part of the scientific=
 method, and expects a lot of work to be done between the theory and the co=
nclusions. =C2=A0A believer often starts with a theory, =C2=A0and then stat=
es new things based on that. =C2=A0The scientist interprets the believer=E2=
=80=99s statements as the believers =E2=80=98conclusions=E2=80=99, and is a=
ppalled at the lack of process that got the believer from theory to conclus=
ion. =C2=A0



The believer is appalled at the scientist's closed mind. =C2=
=A0But in fact, the believer did not mean their statements to actually be c=
onclusions, in the scientific sense. =C2=A0=C2=A0The believer thinks about =
their theories, maybe tests them, and more often than not, comes up with ne=
w THEORIES. =C2=A0But by not stating that these are theories, the scientist=
 sees them as conclusions (since they seemed to flow from theory and testin=
g). =C2=A0And hence, the friction between these camps.



So I think both p=
arties share some of the blame. =C2=A0The scientist assumes the believer un=
derstands the scientific method, and is making conclusions from the scienti=
fic method, when the believer may really just be detailing more theories. =
=C2=A0The believer watches scientific-looking tv shows, uses scientific-loo=
king equipment, and uses scientific-sounding words like =E2=80=98theory=E2=
=80=99 and =E2=80=98evidence=E2=80=99, without realizing this casts them in=
to the scientific method in the ears of the scientific community.



What t=
o do? =C2=A0I think if the scientist/skeptic more often asked things like =
=E2=80=9CAre you sure of that, or is that a theory?=E2=80=9D, and the paran=
ormalist/believer used the word =E2=80=98theory=E2=80=99 a lot more in thei=
r proclamations, it would go a long way toward less hostilities.

Yes=
