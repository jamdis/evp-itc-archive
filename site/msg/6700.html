Laura I was not being rude at all.  I think that you then of all people know how many people bother him being around so long.  He is a good man (as I am sure you will agree) and I very much dislike some (not namely you) who come running through with other motives in mind!
   
  The board was evident of that 2 weeks ago with the mud be thrown.

               The schematics are on in the folder section.  I would request from the new members please not to beg for boxes, it is actually sickening.  Frank is back for a whole 2 minutes and people are graveling at his feet.

            Welcome back Frank,

    I have a question for you. You have given boxes all men here in the group except one man has any woman been given the opportunity to have a box? I have requested one for a  long time now and even offered to pay you.

    But if you just send me the schematics I will build it, I am studying electronics now and here in Mexico the random would be a good thing I believe. Because even though  there�s no English speaking stations near me all I get is English J

 There is a lack of the background hiss, and white noise of the random tuned systems.
 
 The sweep circuit is simple, and using pre-made tuners a real time saver, provided a source for the older tuners can be found. I used to get them from junk yards, but the old radios are getting harder to find. They have the advantage of all the RF components matching the chip.
