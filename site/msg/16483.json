He uses a compass inside a box as the\nindicator for possible paranormal events and has electronics to detect when\nthe compass needle moves. He also has an IR sensor and it&#39;s not clear to me\nif it just senses changes in an IR field or if it uses IR to detect if the\ncompas needle moved.\n\nThere&#39;s no audio involved in it. My guess is that my Trifield meter does the\nsame thing basically but costs more and is less subject to false\ntriggerings.\n\nZack\n\nOn Mon, Jan 4, 2010 at 3:00 PM, W.
