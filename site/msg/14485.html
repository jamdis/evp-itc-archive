Your points seems to be that you can make it work without knowing how it wo=
rks.=C2=A0 So we need to talk about what you mean by that.

When you use th=
e microphone, you just speak, and let the recorder do the rest.=C2=A0 In th=
is case, you are using the recorder without really knowing how it works. =
=C2=A0 If a spirit can manipulate the EMF field around the AtoD converter (=
even without using the mic), then they should be able to do the same: just =
use it without knowing how it works: the recorder does the rest.=C2=A0 In n=
either case do either of you need to know how it works, to get it to work. =
I am not questioning this.

But, if they are going to change the bits on th=
e actual media themselves, then they must know how it works, it order to ge=
t all those bit-things I mentioned right.=C2=A0 The recorder can't "do the =
rest", because by changing the bits on the media themselves, they are going=
 completely around what the recorder does, and doing the details themselves=
.=C2=A0 And as I said, the details there are very technical, and include th=
ings like converting their words into digital samples of groups of a specif=
ic number of bits in a specific format on specific places in specific order=
s with other specific other bits connected to them like file ownership and =
dates and such.=C2=A0 It is the job, basically, of a computer, not a person=
.

If they are changing the bits on the media, then the recorder is not doi=
ng that.=C2=A0 They are no longer letting the recorder "do it", like you or=
 they would be if they just used it normally.=C2=A0 The reason you can "mak=
e it work" without understanding it, is because the recorder is doing the w=
ork for you.=C2=A0 If they are to change the media directly, then the recor=
der is no longer doing the work, and so they must understand all those digi=
tal issues.

So that is the difference between being able to use it without=
 understanding it, and not being able to use it.

work without knowing how it works.  So we need to talk about what you =
mean by that.<br><br>When you use the microphone, you just speak, and let t=
he recorder do the rest.  In this case, you are using the recorder wit=
hout really knowing how it works.   If a spirit can manipulate the EMF=
 field around the AtoD converter (even without using the mic), then they sh=
ould be able to do the same: just use it without knowing how it works: the =
recorder does the rest.  In neither case do either of you need to know=
 how it works, to get it to work. I am not questioning this.<br><br>But, if=
 they are going to change the bits on the actual media themselves, then the=
y must know how it works, it order to get all those bit-things I mentioned =
right.  The recorder can't "do the rest", because by changing the bits=
 on
 the media themselves, they are going completely around what the record=
er does, and doing the details themselves.  And as I said, the details=
 there are very technical, and include things like converting their words i=
nto digital samples of groups of a specific number of bits in a specific fo=
rmat on specific places in specific orders with other specific other bits c=
onnected to them like file ownership and dates and such.  It is the jo=
b, basically, of a computer, not a person.<br><br>If they are changing the =
bits on the media, then the recorder is not doing that.  They are no l=
onger letting the recorder "do it", like you or they would be if they just =
used it normally.  The reason you can "make it work" without understan=
ding it, is because the recorder is doing the work for you.  If they a=
re to change the media directly, then the recorder is no longer doing the w=
ork, and so they must understand all those digital issues.<br><br>So
 that =
is the difference between being able to use it without understanding it, an=
d not being able to use it.<br><br><br><br>--- On <b>Wed, 5/20/09, April Ab=
