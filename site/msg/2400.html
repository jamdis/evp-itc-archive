<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Your grumpy old father better not a touch a hair on that baby or

&gt;  Yeah, the ER said they&#x27;ll probably have to pin the bones because

&gt; &quot;set the dog free&quot; (kill it). My dad used to talk like that...hmmmm.

&gt; Well, you just keep bonding with the poor baby. The aliens are just  
&gt; jealous and they need to suck it up. ;)
&gt;
&gt; She needs surgery, too?

&gt; Yeah, life sucks sometimes! We were hoping to get a loan to pay for  
&gt; her leg surgery, but that&#x27;s a no go.
