Tonight I was in a silly mood, though,  and \ntried doing a little magic act with Oscar to have him read my mind.  I \ndon&#39;t know if it was from being goofy or because of the full moon, but I \ngot 3 responses from him in one little 2 minute recording.  I&#39;m assuming \nit&#39;s the former, since his responses were a little on the silly side, too.\n\r\n--------------000504020508030401010405\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg;\n name=&quot;RS469 2-20-08 Hello Oscar.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: inline;\n filename=&quot;RS469 2-20-08 Hello Oscar.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------000504020508030401010405\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg;\n name=&quot;RS469 2-20-08 Have I ever told you.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: inline;\n filename=&quot;RS469 2-20-08 Have I ever told you.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------000504020508030401010405\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg;\n name=&quot;RS469 2-20-08 Impress your parents.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: inline;\n filename=&quot;RS469 2-20-08 Impress your parents.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------000504020508030401010405--"}
