However I am in need of some \nschematics. \n&gt; Where could I find those?\n&gt; \n&gt; Tom in WIsconsin\n&gt;\nHey Tom,\nI&#39;m new here so I just saw your message. I have downloaded several \nschematics from the internet for different versions of the box as I \ncould find them. If you want me to send them along to you, drop me a \nline. Like you, I want to build one but I lack the expertise and \nknowledge when it comes to electronics so not only do I have to find \nthe right box to build, but also someone to help me out with \nconstructing it as well. \nI have a group here in the La Crosse area but both of my techs left \nto start their own group with some of our other members. So much for \nmy tech department. Anyway, let me know if you want me to send them \nalong to you. They are all in pdf format. Take care and we&#39;ll talk \nwith you again soon.\n\nMark Waldenberger"}
