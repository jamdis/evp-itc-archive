I like predictions -it let's us do real testing, and validate what works, a=
nd invalidate what doesn't (what you called below the "the cut and try meth=
od, see what works").

I have added this prediction to my calendar, and wil=
l remember to remind the group of it when the 17th passes, to help with tha=
t validation/invalidation process.
