<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for the help Juli.  Now that you mention the 20-125, I remember
reading about Steve hacking it.  

I&#x27;ve got the 12-469 &amp; 70 burned in my brain.  Every time I&#x27;m near a
Radio Shack, I stop in to see if they have an older 470.  I will
certainly try out the 20-125.  

I had actually been seriously thinking about getting a Mini Box, but
that&#x27;s a hefty price tag.  Especially since I have no experience with
box research at this point.

&gt; Jeremy:        IF you are unable to find an old 470 and you dont
care for the clicking on the 69, why don&#x27;t you try the 20-125?  This
has the internal speaker and you can hack that as well.  I believe
Steve has directions on his site, keyportparanormal.com.
&gt;    
&gt;   Good luck!

&gt;           I just read on the Paranormal Systems website that they
are developing
&gt; a new box called the MaxiBox. It has a lot of features I&#x27;ve heard
&gt; Bruce mention that would be beneficial to the boxes. 
&gt; 
&gt; Hell, I&#x27;ve been trying my best to locate an older 12-470 to modify so
&gt; I could start doing the research. I know there is the 12-469, but
&gt; I&#x27;ve been hesitant because of all the talk about the annoying click.
