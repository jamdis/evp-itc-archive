EVP-ITC] The copper vs steel box.


=A0I wanted to compare the two boxes, I=
 just finished a galvanized steel box, that scrap metal I get from work. I =
did the same as the copper box, try to select the best sounding speaker for=
 it. The use it with #33. I like the steel box better, I think last night, =
the clearer voices had more to do with conditions thant he equipment. Or--c=
ould it be the other way around, tonights conditions are poor for either bo=
x? It gets frustrating cuz ya can't nail the damn stuff down, it seems to d=
efy any attempts at definition. 
=A0
=A0I know, there was at least one pers=
on scrambling to make a copper box, that's why I wanted more testing. I wis=
h I could give some difinitive answers, but there just=A0doens't seem to be=
 any.

e signifgiant difference with the copper box, I'm not hearing any thing any=
 better.
