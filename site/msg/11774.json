The detector runs on a single\nlithium-ion battery and captures the &quot;specific rhythm of ultrawaves in\nan area&quot; that are supernaturally aligned, according to Solid Alliance\nspokesman Shuichiro Saito.The detector also translates what the maker\ncalls &quot;spatial algorithms&quot;into electronic sounds, warning the user if\na supernatural being isapproaching. Solid Alliance claims on its Web\nsite that Baketan 2 reacted strongly when tested at sites that are\ndeemed haunted. The gadget maker has sold more than 50,000 sets in\nless than three years.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Got Game?
