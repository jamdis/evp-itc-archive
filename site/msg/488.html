<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Vicki, I did get a Luminator photo. Mine appeared a bit dark but I 
should examine it again. 

I was equally impressed with Alex MacRae and Paolo Presi for their 
keen scientific scrutiny of the phenomenon. Even under close 
examination, some submitted EVP&#x27;s appear to be genuine paranormal 
phenomenon. EVP recordings are being subjected to some of the most 
vigorous digital forensic analysis techniques available. Of course, 
many supposed EVP&#x27;s can be debunked, but those considered supernatural 
in origin are classified as such due to audio characteristics that to 
not comply with our physical world as science currently understands 
it. I would recommend any of the doubters to not jump to conclusions 
until reviewing the work of some of these great researchers. 

Better yet, I recommend attempting to record EVP&#x27;s themselves. Be 
patient, but diligent. Nothing convinces a person faster than personal 
experience.

Cheers, Bill

&gt; Hi Bill,
&gt;   Good to see you here!  Enjoyed our lunch together and the 
conference.  Some of those presentations were excellent, weren&#x27;t 
they?  did you get a luminator picture with Mark Macy?  If so, did you 
get anything in it?  Take care, Vicki

&gt;             Hello Frank, those who are advancing the study of EVP&#x27;s 
will likely always face the critics and doubters. Imagine what Tesla, 
Edison, Ford, the Wright brothers, and all the pioneers and early 
adopters have had to deal with. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Vicki, it&#x27;s been nice reading your post. I am still absorbing all 
the presentations including yours I heard at the AA-EVP Conference in 
Atlanta. I was your lunch time pal, Bill Murphy.
