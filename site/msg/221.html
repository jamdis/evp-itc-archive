Hello All,

  I have taken the time to write some stuff up about scrying and pendulums.
Scrying and the use of pendulums are two totally different things. I've
never heard of using both together and honestly, I wouldn't know how to!
Pendulums are very useful to doing paranormal research and ghost hunting,
but honestly, scrying isn't something I would personally not want to do to
do this! 

  If anyone here does scrying and uses a pendulum at the same time to
communicate or researches with the paranormal, I'd be interested to hear how
you do this and why you would do this! The email below is long, but it has a
lot of information that is very useful! It's worth the reading! Thanks!
Leah!

Scrying

Scrying is a method of divination and takes on many forms. Information
received varies with the type of scrying one is using to get answers.
Information can be objective, message given that are in depending of the
scryer - or subjective, determined or influenced by the scryer. Scrying can
also be viewed as a form of mediumship, messages allegedly coming from
another realm. This all goes to the scrying tool used and the interpretation
of the symbol shown. A dream dictionary is often helpful. 

Scrying comes from the Old English word descry meaning "to make out dimly"
or "to reveal." Adding the prefix/suffix 'be' (often 'gye' in Germanic
languages), gives us the modern word 'describe'. 


Art of Scrying


Scrying can be an auto-deepening trance process that progresses in stages
using tools such as a crystal ball, or other medium. Initially, the medium
serves as a focus for the attention, removing unwanted thoughts from the
mind in the same way as a mantra. Once this is achieved, the scryer begins a
free association with the perceived images suggested, for instance in a
crystal ball, by the tiny inclusions, web-like faults and/or the cloudy glow
within the ball under low light (i.e. candlelight). 

The technique of deliberately looking for and declaring these initial images
aloud, however trivial or irrelevant they may seem to the conscious mind, is
done with the intent of deepening the trance state, wherein the scryer hears
their own disassociated voice affirming what is seen within the concentrated
state in a kind of feedback loop. This process culminates in the achievement
of a final and desired end stage in which visual images and dramatic stories
seem to be projected within the mind's eye of the scryer, like an inner
movie. This overall process reputedly allows the scryer to "see" relevant
events or images within the chosen medium. 

Scrying has been used for thousands of years by different cultures. Ancient
Egypt used scrying in their Initiations. This included water scrying, dream
scrying, oil scrying, and mirror scrying. One legend states that the goddess
Hathor carried a shield that could reflect back all things in their true
light. From this shield she allegedly fashioned the first magic mirror to
"see." Ancient Greeks and Celts practiced scrying using beryl, crystal,
black glass, polished quartz, water, and other transparent or light catching
bodies. Nostradamus is believed to have employed a small bowl of water as a
scrying tool into which he gazed and received images of future events.
Alchemists Edward Kelley and John Dee employed a form of scrying using a
small crystal ball or shewstone - a piece of polished obsidian.

Cloud Scrying


Cloud Scrying is one of my favorite past-times. The clouds always speak to
me in scenes of various patterns - sometimes mixed with the colors of the
sky and the setting sun. 

The fluffy cumulous clouds are best as they gently float along and tell an
unfolding story if one is to watch them move. These are seen on days when
the day is sunny with some cloud formations. Having too few or too many
clouds is no good for scrying. The best time is when the clouds are thick. 

Sometimes clouds have layers of colors which seem to accentuate the story
formations. 

While flying on an airplane - it is fun to watch the clouds from above as
the also unfold many interesting patterns - like celestial art. 

You may hear thoughts in your mind while watching clouds images. These are
probably coming from spirit - your own spirit guide - perhaps a Native
American guide of some kind. 

Find a location to relax your mind and watch the clouds. Sometimes the
clouds just seem to call to you and say, "Look up here." 

Watch the clouds as they drift across the sky. the patterns / scenes are
most often very large and easy to see. 

Throughout history symbols of political or religious importance have been
seen in the clouds. In A.D. 312 when Emperor Constantine was marching
against the army of Maxentius at Rome, both he and his entire army saw a
shining cross of light amid the clouds. 

It was said the cross contained the Greek words "By This Conquer". Later
that night Christ appeared to Constantine in his dreams bearing a cross in
his hand ordering Constantine to have a military standard made in the same
image. 

Under this standard his outnumbered army was victorious. Down through
history entire military battles have been witnessed in the clouds.

Crystal Ball Scrying

Crystal Balls can be used as oracles of divination by those who are
clairvoyant. Crystal balls come in many sizes - shapes - colors - types of
crystal - with varying inclusions which allow the psychic to see things in
color spectrums - (the inclusions produce rainbows as light hits the crystal
ball). It is best to use a clear quartz crystal ball with few inclusions or
imperfections. Psychics are generally attracted to the crystal ball they
will use, based on the frequency of the crystal. As with any crystal - the
larger the crystal ball - the stronger the energies. A larger crystal ball
will also give a larger area in which the viewer can observe images.

  _____  

Selecting a Crystal Ball

As with all crystals that come into your life - crystal balls just seem to
'call to you'. There is something in the frequency of the crystal that you
chose - or that chooses you - that is needed to enhance your vibration -
raise it to a higher level - so you can access information more easily.
Remember that all crystals are energy boosters - and are good for
communication no matter what form they are in. 

When a psychic chooses a crystal ball - it is no different than choosing a
crystal skull - for in truth the shape really doesn't matter. It is what the
crystal does for the psychic that is important. 

After working with the crystal ball for a while - or just holding it - you
begin to share a frequency and feel comfortable. 

After selecting your crystal ball - take it home and clean it. I use mild
soap and water then place the crystal ball in the sunlight and moonlight to
energize. 

  _____  

Mirror scrying is an evolved form of water scrying. When it became possible
to build mirrors they were regarded as being like water that was fixed into
one place. 

The early mirrors were made of polished copper, brass, marcasite, tin foil
or mercury behind glass, polished silver and obsidian. All types of mirrors
may be used for scrying and the size is not important. 

Because mirrors are linked to the moon mirrors should be backed with silver.
Try and use a round or oval mirror instead of a square mirror. 

For the frame try and use a mirror that has a silver frame. Old mirrors also
seem to work better than new mirrors. 

Most seers prefer to use a black mirror. Because this is difficult to buy
you may have to make one. 

Just simply take out the glass and paint it black. You may have to give it a
few coats of paint though. When you put it back in the frame make sure the
glass part is to the front. 

The use of black mirrors may be traced back over the centuries. Alchemists
Edward Kelley and John Dee used a black mirror of shewstone - a piece of
polished obsidian. 

When using the black mirror for scrying you do not want to see your
reflection. The best is to leave the mirror on a table and look at it from
an angle. 

Look into the depths of the mirror as though you were looking into a bowl of
water. At first it may appear grey than colors will come and go. 

With time and practice you will be able to see scryed images like still
photographs or moving film images. Spirits may sometimes look at the scryer,
talk to the scryer or even touch the scryer. 

The visions may even exist outside the mirror and surround the scryer on all
sides. 

  _____  

Mirror Scrying - Other Methods 

This type of Mirror Scrying involves messages received on a mirror ... 

*	after it is steamed up in an area such as bathroom - these messages
appear in totality and not no develop as if a script or art design. They may
come from the consciousness of the scryer. 
*	standing in a dark room with a flashlight a few inches below your
face and stare into the mirror for a few minutes. You will see your features
change then change again. Some believe this reflects who you are in a
parallel or past life. 

Remember - when it comes to reality - it's all done with mirrors... 

  _____  


Oil Scrying


The history of oil scrying can be traced back to the ancient Babylonians.
Some of their magic books have survived down through the centuries with
details of the methods they used. 

One of their techniques was called the "Princess of the Thumb". A scryer
anointed the forehead and thumbnail of a subject. 

The shiny nail acted as a magic mirror in which the scryer saw spirits.
Another version was called the "Princess of the Hand". 

Oil was mixed with black soot to make a black paste that was then smeared
upon the hand. The scryer then used the hand as a mirror to scry future
events. 

A third type of oil scrying was called the "Princess of the Cup". Sesame
seed oil was used to coat the inside of a cup that was rested on its side. 

The cup was used as a concave magic mirror to capture and magnify the light
of a candle that was fixed on its inner rim. 

From the Babylonians oil scrying found its way to the Egyptians and Hebrews.
The most detailed examples of oil scrying are written in the Greek Magical
Papyri written in Egypt between 200 B.C. and A.D. 500. 

Four kinds of water which is to be mixed with the oil is used for four types
of divination. 

If you call upon the services of the heavenly Gods then use rainwater. If
you invoke the terrestrial Gods then use sea water. If you invoke the Gods
Osiris or Serapis use riverwater And if you call upon the souls of the dead
then use spring water. 

  _____  


Shell Scrying


This is a modern method of scrying and is becoming more popular. Most people
are familiar with the sound of when a shell is placed over the ear. 

Shell Scrying is listening to the sounds of the ocean. But in fact it is the
sounds of blood flowing through the vessels in your ear. 

If however you listen to this sound you will eventually by able to pick up
fragments of conversation. 

At first you may be able to only make out a few words, but in time you will
come to understand whole segments of conversations. 

It is all about frequencies - and your developing ability to tune into those
sounds and recreate their frequencies into your spoken language. Everything
is about frequency - as in radio or TV - communication - and your ability -
and your ability to tune in - or tune up - as the frequency level may be... 

  _____  


Smoke Scrying


Smoke scrying is watching the patterns that develop as smoke rises either
from candles - outdoor campfire - or the like. 

As you watch the smoke - it will create patterns - much like clouds in the
sky - or ectoplasm in spirit photography. 

You may see people, places, things, letters, numbers, scenes or events.
Often this is in the eyes of the beholder. 

Some images are easy to figure out - while others more need interpretations.


American Indians practice a special type of smoke scrying during a sweat
lodge. Water is poured over hot rocks in a tent to create steam. The steam
is inhaled by those who sit naked around the rocks. 

The combination of temperature, humidity and elevated levels of carbon
dioxide produce a state in which visions can arise. This form of scrying may
be dangerous and should only be undertaken by experienced people. 

  _____  


Water Scrying


You will need a large, deep bowl made from glass, brass or silver. It must
have a smooth and even rim. 

The best time to scry is at night when it is dark and quite. 

Selecting a bowl. You will need to do your own testing to find out which
bowl works best for you and how much water you should use. Metal bowls
contain stronger energy. A ceremonial bowl that connects for you can also be
used. 

Set the water vessel in a dry level space, one in which you can easily
observe. 

Bottled water - or water from a stream is best as it is pure and clear. 

The ancient Greeks believed that nature spirits dwelled in fresh water. 

The water may be stored in a vessel and used again. 

Water with great energy is often thought to be collected by the light of a
full moon. 

To make your wand use a branch from a bay tree, hazel tree or the laurel.
The end of the wand should be covered in dry tree sap or resin. 

Dip the end of the wand into the water until it becomes wet. Wet the rims of
the bowl. By gently drawing the rim of the wand around the bowl it will
cause it to resonate. 

The action of the resonating basin will cause circular ripples to form in
the basin. The water seems to breathe with the sounds. 

It is the harmonics that seem to whisper forth predictions of the future.
These are interpreted with the help spirit. 

In ancient Egypt - scrying by looking into a pool of clear water - brought
visions of gods and of the future. 

You may also receive visual impressions which Nostradamus likened to that of
a "burning mirror". 

You can also scry by looking into a natural body of water such as stream or
lake that is still. Images will form. Moonlight is best for this form of
scrying. 

  _____  


Wind Scrying


Many people hear 'whispers in the wind' as the movement of sound carries
voices that we sometimes pick up. 

Ancient Greeks practiced wind scrying in the sacred grove of Dodona, which
was dedicated to Zeus. Psellus referred to this technique writing "there is
a mode of predicting by means of the air and the leaves of the trees. 

The method seemed to involve the hanging of striking wands from branches of
sacred oak tress in a way that they struck resounding brass basins when the
wind blew. 

Interpretations were made of these sounds and that of the wind. 

On a windy listen - sit or stand in a place - where there are few other
noise to break the flow of the energies of the tones you will hear. 

Casually focus your attention on the wind, blocking out all other thoughts.
You may hear someone talking. Telepathically send a message back through the
movement of the wind and see what happens and who you are talking to. 

You may be hearing between dimensions - or noise or conversations within our
realm. 

In order for you to scry the wind, you must, for a time, become the wind. 

  _____  


Lamp Scrying


Both the Egyptians and Babylonians scryed by means of an oil lamp. The lamp
itself was in fact a stone shaped as a low open dish with a strip of white
linen coiled in the oil that had an end hanging over the end of the dish. 

The Egyptians used clear Oasis oil which was a kind of palm oil. The clearer
the oil the better. 

The Egyptians used a lamp that was red in colour which is the color of the
God Set. Set is in fact the God of evil. 

It may be advisable for you to use a white lamp. Place your lamp on a table
and sit on the west side facing east across the lamp. 

You should address your invocation to the Greco Roman God who rules the day
you scry on. 

Sunday : Sol. 

Monday : Luna. 

Tuesday : Mars. 

Wednesday : Mercury. 

Thursday : Jupiter. 

Friday : Venus. 

Saturday : Saturn.

Using the name of the God of the day you should chant a suitable invocation
doing so directly into the flame. This invocation should be chanted in a
soft voice and done so several times. 

Gently focus on the flames of the lamp. You will begin to see moving shadows
off to the side. 

Do not look directly at the shadows or they will vanish. Ask the shadows
what it is you seek. 

You may hear voices or you may see images. 

  _____  

Crystal Ball Reading

To begin a crystal ball reading one should 

- place the crystal ball on a stand 
- place it on a table with a solid - usually dark surface 
- hold it in their hands - either in one place or turning it slightly
- have the person they are reading touch it also

Gazing into a clear crystal ball opens the third eye and allows the psychic
to see images that appear physical - then others that are non-physical. The
psychic is focusing their mind and seeing beyond 'visual eyes.' It is almost
hypnotic s one is looking within for information. 

Your eyes may appear to cross if you gaze too long. In that case - relax and
start again. 

Images with the crystal ball can be stationary or move around as if viewing
a screen. 

This takes time and practice and the ability to relax the mind. 

When two people can gaze into the crystal ball at the same time - they usual
see different things and get different messages. It is whatever you tune
into - like a radio! 

The psychic will tell you what they see as they gaze into the crystal ball.
Record - or write down - what they say. Scrying Crystal ball reading is
linked to  <http://www.crystalinks.com/scrying.html> Scrying.

Scrying is divination of distant or future events based on visions seen in a
ball of rock crystal. Divination based on an analysis of reflections in
water, on polished metal, or on precious stones was practiced by early
humans, who probably interpreted these phenomena as a vision of the spirit
world. Scrying became widespread by the 5th century AD and was condemned by
the medieval Christian church as the work of the devil. 

Crystal gazing was a popular pastime in the Victorian era, together with
palmistry and astrology, and it involved elaborate rituals for cleaning the
crystal ball and for conducting crystal-gazing sessions, which are said to
work best when the Sun is at its northernmost declination. Immediately
before the appearance of a vision (which may be realistic or a mere wispy
swirl), the globe is said to mist up from within. 

  _____  

Interpretations of Images

Interpreting what you see in a crystal ball is like any other form of
divination. 

Colors - symbols - everything you see - has meaning and must be interrupted
based on the person involved. 

Shapes can be recognizable or can be archetypes of something connected to
the person you are reading. The larger the image appears in the crystal ball
- the closer the time line for it to manifest in third dimension - and the
more important the information is. Everything seen or heard should be
recorded - on paper or by a tape machine. Images my be stationary - or may
appear to move. They may move around the crystal as if showing a scene. They
may look flat - two dimensional - or be holographic.

Egyptian Dream Scrying


Egyptian dream scrying may be traced back thousands of years. The method
used by the Egyptians was recorded in the Greek magical papyri which were
written between 200 B.C. to 500 A.D. 

In preparing to use the Egyptian dream scrying method you must not speak to
anyone on the evening you plan to scry. You should remain in silence after
the setting of the sun. 

Do not consume alcohol on that day or engage in sex. You must refrain from
consuming food for up to four hours before the scrying. 

After having a warm bath you anoint your temples with olive oil. You will
need an oil lamp which must not be colored red or bear any inscription. 

Write on a short narrow strip of white linen with ink mixed with myrrh the
name of the dream God and the purpose for the dream scrying. Twist the linen
strip into a wick and insert into the oil of the lamp. 

Place the lamp on a table beside your bed. Using the ink draw the image of
the dream God upon your left palm. 

You must decide which God or Goddess you wish to use. Thoth was well used
with the Egyptians. 

Light your lamp. - Kneel before the lamp. 

Concentrating on the image on your left hand recite the following invocation
: 
Thoth I invoke, blessed power of dreams divine,
Angel of future fates, swift wings are thine,
Great source of oracles to human kind,
When stealing soft, and whispering to the mind,
Through sleep's sweet silence and the gloom of night,
Thy power awake the sight,
To silent souls the will of heaven relates,
And silently reveals their future fates.

Concentrate on your question. Around your left hand wrap a piece of black
linen about four inches wide and about thirty inches long. The black cloth
is called the 'black eye of Isis. <http://www.crystalinks.com/isis.html>  -
or the Magic of Isis. 

Blow out the flame of the lamp. 

Clear your mind and go to sleep. 

Have a tape recorder beside your bed so that when you awaken you may record
your dreams while still fresh in your mind. 

You will find that the dream will come to you in a voice that is clear and
powerful rather than in dream images. Sometimes the messages are in symbols
- cryptic forms. Take your time in deciphering the messages you have
received. You may want to use a dream dictionary.

HOW TO USE A PENDULUM

Once you select your pendulum you are ready to begin. 

Sit down and get comfortable. Your mind and body should feel relaxed with no
stress. 

You can rest your elbow on a table in front of you allow the pendulum to
swing free - or you can hold your arm in a horizontal position again
allowing your pendulum to swing freely. 

You do not have to be psychic to use a pendulum. It will guide itself. It is
moved by either your thoughts or someone in spirit who works through you -
generally your spirit guide. 

The first step is to get the feel of the pendulum and how it will move for
you. 

Pendulums movements: 

- straight line - side to side or front and back 
- circles - clockwise or counterclockwise
- elliptical motion 

Most questions asked when using a pendulum have Yes or No answers. You must
determine the direction your pendulum will take for Yes and for No. 

Hold the pendulum in your hand. With the other hand - touch the point to
steady its motion. 

Keep your eyes on the point. 

Now address the pendulum and say, "Show me 'Yes'." It will soon swing in one
direction - which could be side to side, back and forth, or circles. 

Now say, "Show me No." It should swing in the opposite direction. 

Be certain the pendulum is not being guided by the movement of your hand or
fingers. 

Once you have determine the pattern for Yes and No - you are ready to begin.


There are times that the answer is unknown - or the spirit needs more
information. At that time - the pendulum will swing diagonally. 

The faster the movement - the stronger the energies. 

Sometimes a pendulum will appear to bob or dance up and down. This is
usually an affirmative response. the point is sometimes called a bobber. 

It the pendulum does not move at all - then you must stop and try again at
another time - or find another way to channel. 

There are generally no rituals involve with pendulum use - though some
people hold their pendulum in their hand before they begin to 'charge' it. 

You can use it anywhere. 

When you ask your questions you may want to record the answers. 

Now you are ready to begin to ask your questions. 

Start with something simple such as, "Is it sunny today?" "Is it Monday?"
"Are you here to answer my questions?" 

Once you get the 'swing' of it - you can move on to personal questions. 

Remember to only ask a question ONCE. If you want more information - you
might want to use a chart. At this time the pendulum should be about two
inches above the chart - or as is comfortable. 

If the motion of your pendulum increases - or the circles get large - the
energy is increasing and you can expect change linked to the question you
were asking. Pursue further questions to get additional information. 

Pendulums can be made of different materials. The best length for the
pendulum is six inches. As long as the bobber - or weight on the end is not
too light - nor too heavy. It should weigh less than have an ounce. The best
shape for the weight - or point - is something that comes to a point. 

You can make your pendulum or buy one. Pendulums are a simple way to
communicate with the other side. I have seen people in stores use them to
select products such as - books - produce - clothing - just about anything. 

The most common types of pendulums are: 

- a crystal tied with wire then suspended on a chain or cord 
- a chain necklace with some kind of charm suspended at the bottom
- a chain with metal pointer at the bottom - these are usual store bought
- the human body - which is a pendulum that can move back and forth - or
side to side 

  _____  

CHAKRAS - POLARITIES <http://www.crystalinks.com/chakras.html> 

- Stand in front of - or directly behind - the person you are working with. 

Place the pendulum directly over their crown chakra [top of head]. It will
either swing back and forth or side to side - or in circles. 

Next place the pendulum in front of the third eye [forehead]. If the chakra
is balanced the pendulum will swing in the opposite direction of the crown
chakra - or the circles will be reversed. 

Continue with each chakra down the line - throat, solar plexus, spleen, and
root. 

If a chakra is balanced the pendulum will continue to reverse polarities 

If it is out of balance the pendulum will swing in the wrong direction - or
not at all 

You can also use the pendulum by placing it slowly a few inches away from a
person's body. The point should remain still and move when it locates a
problem.

DOWSING


Dowsing is the action of a person called the dowser using a rod, stick or
other device called a dowsing rod, dowsing stick, doodlebug (when used to
locate oil) or divining rod to locate such things as underground water,
hidden metal, buried treasure, oil, lost persons or golf balls, etc. Since
dowsing is not based upon any known scientific or empirical laws or forces
of nature, it should be considered a type of divination. 

Map dowsers use a dowsing device, usually a pendulum, over maps to locate
oil, minerals, persons, water, etc. However, the prototype of a dowser is
the field dowser who walks around an area using a forked stick to locate
underground water. When above water, the rod points downward. (Some dowsers
use two rods. The rods cross when above water.) Various theories have been
given as to what causes the rods to move: electromagnetic or other subtle
geological forces, suggestion from others or from geophysical observations,
ESP and other paranormal explanations, etc. 

Dowsing and other forms of divination have been around for thousands of
years. There are large societies of dowsers in American and Europe and
dowsers practice their art every day in all parts of the world. There have
even been scientists in recent years who have offered proof that dowsing
works. 

The testimonials of dowsers and those who observe them provide the main
evidence for dowsing. The evidence is simple: dowsers find what they are
dowsing for and they do this many times. Scientific thinking includes being
constantly vigilant against self-deception and being careful not to rely
upon insight or intuition in place of rigorous and precise empirical testing
of theoretical and causal claims. 

Controlled study of dowsers, has shown that dowsers that dowser believe in
what they do - but much of it is by chance. 

Dowsing is a searching tool that has been used for thousands of years by
those who have tried, with the help of a Y shaped rod, to locate underground
water, ore bodies, oil and other important resources. Dowsing is subjective
by nature. Its success depends on the qualities developed by the dowsers
themselves, who sense, via a mind-body link, the presence of underground
structures. 

Scientists have tried to understand the physical basis of dowsing; what
factors link the movement of the rod in the dowser's hand to underground
structures. No one has yet successfully explained the dowsing signal and for
now it remains by chance - or another psychic tool. 

 

Thanks!

 

Leah!

<p><b><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;">Hello All,<o></o></span></font></b></p>

<p><b><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;">  I have taken the time to write some stuff up about
scrying and pendulums. Scrying and the use of pendulums are two totally
different things. I’ve never heard of using both together and honestly, I
wouldn’t know how to! Pendulums are very useful to doing paranormal
research and ghost hunting, but honestly, scrying isn’t something I would
personally not want to do to do this! <o></o></span></font></b></p>

<p><b><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;">  If anyone here does scrying and uses a pendulum at the
same time to communicate or researches with the paranormal, I’d be
interested to hear how you do this and why you would do this! The email below
is long, but it has a lot of information that is very useful! It’s worth
the reading! Thanks! Leah!<o></o></span></font></b></p>

<p align="center" style="text-align:center;"><b><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;">Scrying<o></o></span></font></b></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Scrying
is a method of divination and takes on many forms. Information received varies
with the type of scrying one is using to get answers. Information can be
objective, message given that are in depending of the scryer - or subjective,
determined or influenced by the scryer. Scrying can also be viewed as a form of
mediumship, messages allegedly coming from another realm. This all goes to the
scrying tool used and the interpretation of the symbol shown. A dream
dictionary is often helpful. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Scrying
comes from the Old English word descry meaning "to make out dimly" or
"to reveal." Adding the prefix/suffix 'be' (often 'gye' in Germanic
languages), gives us the modern word 'describe'. <o></o></span></font></p>

<h3 align="center" style="text-align:center;"><b><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Art of Scrying<o></o></span></font></b></h3>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Scrying
can be an auto-deepening trance process that progresses in stages using tools
such as a crystal ball, or other medium. Initially, the medium serves as a
focus for the attention, removing unwanted thoughts from the mind in the same
way as a mantra. Once this is achieved, the scryer begins a free association
with the perceived images suggested, for instance in a crystal ball, by the
tiny inclusions, web-like faults and/or the cloudy glow within the ball under
low light (i.e. candlelight). <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
technique of deliberately looking for and declaring these initial images aloud,
however trivial or irrelevant they may seem to the conscious mind, is done with
the intent of deepening the trance state, wherein the scryer hears their own
disassociated voice affirming what is seen within the concentrated state in a
kind of feedback loop. This process culminates in the achievement of a final
and desired end stage in which visual images and dramatic stories seem to be
projected within the mind's eye of the scryer, like an inner movie. This
overall process reputedly allows the scryer to "see" relevant events
or images within the chosen medium. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Scrying
has been used for thousands of years by different cultures. Ancient <st1><st1>Egypt</st1></st1> used
scrying in their Initiations. This included water scrying, dream scrying, oil
scrying, and mirror scrying. One legend states that the goddess Hathor carried
a shield that could reflect back all things in their true light. From this
shield she allegedly fashioned the first magic mirror to "see."
Ancient Greeks and Celts practiced scrying using beryl, crystal, black glass,
polished quartz, water, and other transparent or light catching bodies.
Nostradamus is believed to have employed a small bowl of water as a scrying
tool into which he gazed and received images of future events. Alchemists Edward
Kelley and John Dee employed a form of scrying using a small crystal ball or
shewstone - a piece of polished obsidian.<o></o></span></font></p>

<h3 align="center" style="text-align:center;"><b><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Cloud Scrying<o></o></span></font></b></h3>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Cloud
Scrying is one of my favorite past-times. The clouds always speak to me in
scenes of various patterns - sometimes mixed with the colors of the sky and the
setting sun. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
fluffy cumulous clouds are best as they gently float along and tell an
unfolding story if one is to watch them move. These are seen on days when the
day is sunny with some cloud formations. Having too few or too many clouds is
no good for scrying. The best time is when the clouds are thick. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Sometimes
clouds have layers of colors which seem to accentuate the story formations. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">While
flying on an airplane - it is fun to watch the clouds from above as the also
unfold many interesting patterns - like celestial art. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">You
may hear thoughts in your mind while watching clouds images. These are probably
coming from spirit - your own spirit guide - perhaps a Native American guide of
some kind. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Find
a location to relax your mind and watch the clouds. Sometimes the clouds just
seem to call to you and say, "Look up here." <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Watch
the clouds as they drift across the sky. the patterns / scenes are most often
very large and easy to see. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Throughout
history symbols of political or religious importance have been seen in the
clouds. In A.D. 312 when Emperor Constantine was marching against the army of
Maxentius at <st1><st1>Rome</st1></st1>,
both he and his entire army saw a shining cross of light amid the clouds. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">It
was said the cross contained the Greek words "By This Conquer". Later
that night Christ appeared to <st1>Constantine</st1> in his
dreams bearing a cross in his hand ordering <st1><st1>Constantine</st1></st1> to have a military standard made
in the same image. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Under
this standard his outnumbered army was victorious. Down through history entire
military battles have been witnessed in the clouds. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Crystal
Balls can be used as oracles of divination by those who are clairvoyant.
Crystal balls come in many sizes - shapes - colors - types of crystal - with
varying inclusions which allow the psychic to see things in color spectrums -
(the inclusions produce rainbows as light hits the crystal ball). It is best to
use a clear quartz crystal ball with few inclusions or imperfections. Psychics
are generally attracted to the crystal ball they will use, based on the
frequency of the crystal. As with any crystal - the larger the crystal ball -
the stronger the energies. A larger crystal ball will also give a larger area
in which the viewer can observe images.<o></o></span></font></p>

<div align="center" style="text-align:center;"><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;"><b><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;">Selecting
a Crystal Ball</span></font></b><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;"><o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">As
with all crystals that come into your life - crystal balls just seem to 'call
to you'. There is something in the frequency of the crystal that you chose - or
that chooses you - that is needed to enhance your vibration - raise it to a
higher level - so you can access information more easily. Remember that all
crystals are energy boosters - and are good for communication no matter what
form they are in. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">When
a psychic chooses a crystal ball - it is no different than choosing a crystal
skull - for in truth the shape really doesn't matter. It is what the crystal
does for the psychic that is important. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">After
working with the crystal ball for a while - or just holding it - you begin to
share a frequency and feel comfortable. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">After
selecting your crystal ball - take it home and clean it. I use mild soap and
water then place the crystal ball in the sunlight and moonlight to energize. <o></o></span></font></p>

</span></font></div>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Mirror
scrying is an evolved form of water scrying. When it became possible to build
mirrors they were regarded as being like water that was fixed into one place. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
early mirrors were made of polished copper, brass, marcasite, tin foil or
mercury behind glass, polished silver and obsidian. All types of mirrors may be
used for scrying and the size is not important. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Because
mirrors are linked to the moon mirrors should be backed with silver. Try and
use a round or oval mirror instead of a square mirror. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">For
the frame try and use a mirror that has a silver frame. Old mirrors also seem
to work better than new mirrors. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Most
seers prefer to use a black mirror. Because this is difficult to buy you may
have to make one. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Just
simply take out the glass and paint it black. You may have to give it a few
coats of paint though. When you put it back in the frame make sure the glass
part is to the front. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
use of black mirrors may be traced back over the centuries. Alchemists Edward
Kelley and John Dee used a black mirror of shewstone - a piece of polished obsidian.
<o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">When
using the black mirror for scrying you do not want to see your reflection. The
best is to leave the mirror on a table and look at it from an angle. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Look
into the depths of the mirror as though you were looking into a bowl of water.
At first it may appear grey than colors will come and go. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">With
time and practice you will be able to see scryed images like still photographs
or moving film images. Spirits may sometimes look at the scryer, talk to the
scryer or even touch the scryer. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
visions may even exist outside the mirror and surround the scryer on all sides.

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
history of oil scrying can be traced back to the ancient Babylonians. Some of
their magic books have survived down through the centuries with details of the
methods they used. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">One
of their techniques was called the "Princess of the Thumb". A scryer anointed
the forehead and thumbnail of a subject. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
shiny nail acted as a magic mirror in which the scryer saw spirits. Another
version was called the "Princess of the Hand". <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Oil
was mixed with black soot to make a black paste that was then smeared upon the
hand. The scryer then used the hand as a mirror to scry future events. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">A
third type of oil scrying was called the "Princess of the Cup".
Sesame seed oil was used to coat the inside of a cup that was rested on its
side. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
cup was used as a concave magic mirror to capture and magnify the light of a
candle that was fixed on its inner rim. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">From
the Babylonians oil scrying found its way to the Egyptians and Hebrews. The
most detailed examples of oil scrying are written in the Greek Magical Papyri
written in <st1><st1>Egypt</st1></st1>
between 200 B.C. and A.D. 500. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Four
kinds of water which is to be mixed with the oil is used for four types of
divination. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">If
you call upon the services of the heavenly Gods then use rainwater. If you
invoke the terrestrial Gods then use sea water. If you invoke the Gods Osiris
or Serapis use riverwater And if you call upon the souls of the dead then use
spring water. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">This
is a modern method of scrying and is becoming more popular. Most people are
familiar with the sound of when a shell is placed over the ear. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Shell
Scrying is listening to the sounds of the ocean. But in fact it is the sounds
of blood flowing through the vessels in your ear. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">If
however you listen to this sound you will eventually by able to pick up
fragments of conversation. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">At
first you may be able to only make out a few words, but in time you will come
to understand whole segments of conversations. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">It
is all about frequencies - and your developing ability to tune into those
sounds and recreate their frequencies into your spoken language. Everything is
about frequency - as in radio or TV - communication - and your ability - and
your ability to tune in - or tune up - as the frequency level may be... <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">As
you watch the smoke - it will create patterns - much like clouds in the sky -
or ectoplasm in spirit photography. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">You
may see people, places, things, letters, numbers, scenes or events. Often this
is in the eyes of the beholder. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Some
images are easy to figure out - while others more need interpretations. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">American
Indians practice a special type of smoke scrying during a sweat lodge. Water is
poured over hot rocks in a tent to create steam. The steam is inhaled by those
who sit naked around the rocks. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
combination of temperature, humidity and elevated levels of carbon dioxide
produce a state in which visions can arise. This form of scrying may be
dangerous and should only be undertaken by experienced people. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">You
will need a large, deep bowl made from glass, brass or silver. It must have a
smooth and even rim. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
best time to scry is at night when it is dark and quite. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Selecting
a bowl. You will need to do your own testing to find out which bowl works best for
you and how much water you should use. Metal bowls contain stronger energy. A
ceremonial bowl that connects for you can also be used. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Set
the water vessel in a dry level space, one in which you can easily observe. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Bottled
water - or water from a stream is best as it is pure and clear. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
ancient Greeks believed that nature spirits dwelled in fresh water. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
water may be stored in a vessel and used again. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Water
with great energy is often thought to be collected by the light of a full moon.
<o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">To
make your wand use a branch from a bay tree, hazel tree or the laurel. The end
of the wand should be covered in dry tree sap or resin. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Dip
the end of the wand into the water until it becomes wet. Wet the rims of the
bowl. By gently drawing the rim of the wand around the bowl it will cause it to
resonate. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
action of the resonating basin will cause circular ripples to form in the
basin. The water seems to breathe with the sounds. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">It
is the harmonics that seem to whisper forth predictions of the future. These
are interpreted with the help spirit. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">In
ancient <st1><st1>Egypt</st1></st1>
- scrying by looking into a pool of clear water - brought visions of gods and
of the future. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">You
may also receive visual impressions which Nostradamus likened to that of a
"burning mirror". <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">You
can also scry by looking into a natural body of water such as stream or lake
that is still. Images will form. Moonlight is best for this form of scrying. <o></o></span></font></p>

<h3 align="center" style="text-align:center;"><b><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Wind Scrying<o></o></span></font></b></h3>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Many
people hear 'whispers in the wind' as the movement of sound carries voices that
we sometimes pick up. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Ancient
Greeks practiced wind scrying in the sacred grove of Dodona, which was
dedicated to Zeus. Psellus referred to this technique writing "there is a
mode of predicting by means of the air and the leaves of the trees. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
method seemed to involve the hanging of striking wands from branches of sacred
oak tress in a way that they struck resounding brass basins when the wind blew.
<o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Interpretations
were made of these sounds and that of the wind. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">On
a windy listen - sit or stand in a place - where there are few other noise to
break the flow of the energies of the tones you will hear. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Casually
focus your attention on the wind, blocking out all other thoughts. You may hear
someone talking. Telepathically send a message back through the movement of the
wind and see what happens and who you are talking to. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">You
may be hearing between dimensions - or noise or conversations within our realm.
<o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">In
order for you to scry the wind, you must, for a time, become the wind. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">Both
the Egyptians and Babylonians scryed by means of an oil lamp. The lamp itself
was in fact a stone shaped as a low open dish with a strip of white linen
coiled in the oil that had an end hanging over the end of the dish. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
Egyptians used clear Oasis oil which was a kind of palm oil. The clearer the
oil the better. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">The
Egyptians used a lamp that was red in colour which is the color of the God Set.
Set is in fact the God of evil. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">It
may be advisable for you to use a white lamp. Place your lamp on a table and
sit on the west side facing east across the lamp. <o></o></span></font></p>

<p><font size="1" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;">You
should address your invocation to the Greco Roman God who rules the day you scry
on. <o></o></span></font></p>
