They have a very hard  \nseeing that both can exist at once. There seem to be al kinds of  \nspirits--from stuck humans to purple aliens to lost kids to pets to  \ndark entities to who knows what all else. And each type has some sort  \nof place it seems to thrive or dwell in or visit. For some  \nresearchers, only one type of spirit is the type they want to seek,  \ntalk to, or prove exists. There is nothing wrong with this, as long  \nas they know there are other types as well. So, if a person only  \nwants to be with a certain type of spirit, it&#39;s their choice--in  \nwhich case, that&#39;s fine--or out of ignorance. Perhaps you can say to  \nthe second type of these people, &quot;You may not have been in this field  \nlong enough to have encountered spirits that are far outside this  \nmold of (trapped or lost humans, demonic entities, etc.), but there  \nare a great number of types of spirits and once you have encountered  \nthem, you&#39;ll see this is not a simple question with simple answers.&quot;\n\nAnn\n\n\nOn Nov 9, 2007, at 3:49 PM, Frank Sumption wrote:\n\n&gt;  I think I&#39;ll start making a distinction between the typical  \n&gt; paranormal investigator moron, and ITC.
