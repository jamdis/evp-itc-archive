&gt; Heres a few from a recent session I am sharing with the group. I 
recently bumped into one of the names they have been mentioning and I 
thought they meant someone who passed. Then I run across someone with 
the same name who is becoming involved in the ITC field of study. So 
I asked my group there why they have expressed such an interest in 
him. Someone (alive) mentioned it&#x27;s because he is into studying 
reverse speech and has trained his ears to hear it. I have to agree 
he definitely hears things out of my ranges, and his methods totally 
differ from my own. They only gave me a few clear answers to my 
question and one of them is the first attached file. Hope you can 
hear it easily because for me it is very clear. Probably one of the 
clearest so far. 
&gt;    
&gt;   The rest of the attachments are other entities who popped in the 
conversation and some of thier chat was directed at each other. As 
for the a-hole thing on the last part when it mentioned other mouths 
to talk I had a flashback of Ace Ventura bending over making his butt 
cheeks talk, I dont know why but I found it funny. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Yes sometimes they argue amongst themselves, or bump into 
entities they know and carry on conversations.

Just heard that undertaker recording of your Misty -- very clear! I 
wonder what it means?</pre>
