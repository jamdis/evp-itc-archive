I&#39;ve also done lots of psychic work over the years, had lots of\nexperiences, and consider the unseen world as &quot;normal&quot; and real as our\nso-called ordinary world.\n\nI have wanted for years to try recording voices of my unseen associates, and\nam SO excited to begin to experiment, so I thank you all for the invaluable\ninformation I&#39;m reading on this list so far!\n\nI have some very basic questions, and apologize if they are too simple or\nrepetitious for the more experienced and regular members of this list.\n\nWhen some of you are mentioning that your mini-box is on the way, from where\nare you buying it? What other systems are available, other than making one\nwith the Radio Shack radios (which I will experiment with for sure!).\n\nWould it be possible to list the possible other equipment that one might\nbuy, and the sources? Or is this already available somewhere on the\nyahoogroups website for this group?\n\nThanks in advance to one and all for any help you can give me with this...\nthere&#39;s SO much great info here it&#39;s a bit hard to sort out as a newbie on\nthe list who just dove in recently!\n\nCheers,\n\nLeslie (in NYC)\n\n&quot;A hunch is creativity trying to tell you something.&quot;\n\n\t-- Frank Capra, Film Director\n\n&quot;Honor your error as a hidden intention.&quot;\n\n\t-- Brian Eno"}
