It was important \nfor our engineer Ron, as well as our team at ASUP for you to see it and \nwe deeply appreciate your cooperation and support.\n\nSo many of the main players in paranormal research were impressed with \nthe device, and most of them will be the proud owners of the MiniBox \nsoon. They were impressed with the quality of the construction, the \nportability, and the performance considering the more than reasonable \ncost of the unit. \n\nThank you again!\n\n~April Slaughter"}
