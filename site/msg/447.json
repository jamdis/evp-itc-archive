Most of the people who joined both groups \nplay no part in this war of words thats been going on and as for \nhaving an enemy camp...who made you the judge?\n\nI will say the same thing I said to the owner of the other group. I \njoined both groups to study evp, I dont know what you all joined to \naccomplish but to learn more and progress were my intentions. I had \nnothing to do with any of the arguments going on. When you guys fight \nit just lowers your vibration and interferes with the work. Franks \nbeen told this as well as the GH group.\n\nSo if you want to continue your war of words try using private email \nand leaving the innocent people who just want to study and research \nout of your drama.\n\nI&#39;ve been told my unsubscription was accidental and I can rejoin. I \nmay do that once the negative crap is over and done with. Unlike a \nfew others I chose not to take sides. I&#39;d rather spend my few moments \nof freetime learning and doing sessions rather than join the tongue \nlashing. You should all do the same, after all thats what the groups \nare for..... So we can discuss evp, not the &quot;days of our lives&quot;\n\nMisty\n\n&gt; And to anyone else who plans on staying in Frank&#39;s enemy camp here, \nyou \n&gt; are missing some other really good lists.\n&gt;"}
