Th=\r\ne stuff I have been working on outside this ghost box stuff was completely =\r\nled by &quot;spirits&quot; on the other side. My job, if you will, was to begin a web=\r\nsite and build it for the sole purpose of getting others to consider that t=\r\nhere might be more than the physical realm. That led to Angels & Ghosts in =\r\n2004, and I had no idea why that name was given, but I went with it. I love=\r\n the tech side, but have felt the goal of A & G was to make people think an=\r\nd decide for themselves. There are plenty of the debunkers, TAPS type inves=\r\ntigators out there, and that was not the vision I had been given (though I =\r\nlike that approach). We recieve submissions from all over the world of audi=\r\no, pictures, videos, stories, etc, and then I post much if it monthly. Agai=\r\nn, the site&#39;s flavor is &quot;you decide.&quot; In the digital age, there is no way t=\r\no authenticate what&#39;s absolutely truth, from fiction. So, again my mantra h=\r\nas been, &quot;You decide.&quot; Do I think everything on A & G is of ghosts and spir=\r\nits? Nah...not my job to anyway. I make it interesting, and allow the minds=\r\n of the visitors to decide. That&#39;s been my job and the spirits&#39; beckoning. =\r\nThey want people to begin looking for more than what the five sense can bri=\r\nng them. I feel they speak often, but we don&#39;t listen enough. However, I al=\r\nso feel they speak often and we think it is coincidence or better yet our o=\r\nwn thoughts - LOL. ;) January of &#39;07 began with a dream and a &quot;new technolo=\r\ngy&quot; I was to work on that would be big. I sort of blew it off as a pizza dr=\r\neam, but then was led to contact people from my past for &quot;other purposes&quot; o=\r\nf business This of course unwittingly led back to this whole communication =\r\nbox, again. They (spirits) will not let up on me.So I am working on project=\r\ns and I get nudged in the spirit to get on this box thing again. I pop on h=\r\nere, see the latest news with the RS Hack (they bugged me as soon as it bro=\r\nke, but I stalled a few days) and am now running experiments, etc with it. =\r\nI am posting articles, videos and audio about it to spread the word.
