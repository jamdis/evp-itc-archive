I have a Soundblaster X-FI (with the front\npanel I/O) for example, and the drivers are notoriously finicky under\nXP.  The last time it went out, it was just like you described - loud\npop through the speakers then no sound.  I build my own PC&#39;s and work\nin software, so troubleshooting is down my alley and I proceeded to\ntroubleshoot after that happened.  Reseated the card, uninstalled and\nreinstalled the drivers, etc. etc.  Wouldn&#39;t work right until several\nweeks later after another reboot everything finally was mapped right.\n\nMarty  \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, monki rei &lt;monkiintherabbithole@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey,\n&gt; I am having an unbelievable time with fried equipment.
