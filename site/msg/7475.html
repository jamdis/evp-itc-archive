Hi Frank,
 
I am sorry about your wife.  I am going thru a similar situation with  my 
father but he refuses to take care of himself.  Most of all I got on him  about 
the smoking which is funny because I still smoke.  But he has a sever  case of 
sleep apnea that has not been diagnosed yet and he is robbign his body  of 
much needed oxygen.  Anyways, the spirits had a message for me today  regarding 
my father and they called him a puppy.  WHich he is at this point  always 
striving for attention, boy do they have his number.  I hope all  goes better with 
your wife.
 
Jeff

I heard the Norma one really clear. The one marked "seg" I  heard something 
say SUDDEN DEATH RADIO which I thought was kind of ironic.  Did you hear 
that part of it?

I'm readding  the "digest" here at work. I have the group e-mail off, or I'd 
spend all day  just on e-mail! 

There does seem to be synchronistic  fragments from time to time, and I think 
this is just part of this  method. If it's meaningful then I accept it as a 
message. I did hear  that, but didn't want to bias the segment too much. 

Yeah,  they mention my wife often, which my not be a good thing, as she had a 
 heart attack about a year and half a go, but still refuses to quit  
smoking--she caughs all the time, esspecially when there's somehting I want to  hear! 


thanks!

Frank-S
