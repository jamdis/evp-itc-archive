<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Everything is ok by me. It&#x27; not like I&#x27;m the big expert or something. I 
think everyone needs a varity of methods to use, cuz it seems like 
everything has it&#x27;s time when it works, and nothing else does. I use other 
stuff as the whim hits, but it might be kinda intuition. I want to play with 
the manual radio method, but I go downstairs, and there sits the 
board....waiting, so I start playing with that, next thing I know it&#x27;s 
midnight!
The only requirement is a radio with a tuning knob, preferabley non-digital. 
You want a radio that doesn&#x27;t kill the audio between stations as you tune 
across the band. I was &quot;playinig&quot; just a bit, and it does seem to work 
better with smooth, constant motion while tuning, maybe taking only a few 
seconds to cover the whole band. I was using the &quot;shower&quot; radio in the 
bathroom. I&#x27;m gonna have to do some experimenting, maybe I don&#x27;t need the 
random voltage, maybe just a slow traingle wave would do, so the tuning 
voltage slowly goes up, then slowly down. That would be a piece of cake! No 
finicky noise transisitor would be big plus. I already modified the latest 
board to take an external VT signal (V-oltage-T-uning), that&#x27;s just adding a 
connector, with a blocking diode to isolate the external voltage from the on 
board VT amp.
