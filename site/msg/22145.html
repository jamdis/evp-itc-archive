&gt;  Time for me to back the fuck up and look in the mirror. Since day one,
&gt; one arguement after another over the boxes, what they are for, who can use
&gt; it, how one jerkoff or another is the master box user and determines who
&gt; can use the box, and always somebody claims my work no good, while theirs
&gt; superior.  I&#x27;m jumping off this track, ya want it? You got it, someone else
&gt; can have the loonies, the con men, the tricksters, the posers, and the
&gt; &quot;ones that know better&quot;. Not getting sucked into the dark with this box
&gt; crap any longer, it was supposed to be for my own use anyway, y&#x27;all simply
&gt; can&#x27;t handle that level of spirit communication. Learned the hard way that
&gt; there is a reason why certain knowledge is withheld from the uninitiated.
&gt;  I can&#x27;t fix what I have done, all I can do is walk away. Like the guy said
&gt; &quot;you can&#x27;t handle the truth!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;  Not gonna debate it, been there done that, no one hears or listens,
&gt; always &quot; Oh, I know so much better&quot; is the response. &quot;For my research&quot;,
&gt; yeah, heard that about five hundred times!
&gt;
&gt;  Time for me to seek the light side of the force--while there is still
&gt; time.
