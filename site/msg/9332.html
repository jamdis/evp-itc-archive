<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Oh noooooo, Kay and Jeff.  I&#x27;m having a vision that making another purchase at Radio 
Shack is in my near future.  ROFLOL.  

Looking forward to hearing some 820 examples once they start coming through for you.

&gt; The diffence between the 12-820 and new 12-469 is amazing. There is 
&gt; no clicking what so ever on either band. The Am band is so quiet I 
&gt; had to look at the radio to make sure it was still sweeping! I tried 
&gt; it out this morning for a bit but didnt get anything. I hope they 
&gt; like the new radio.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the update, Kay.  I&#x27;ve also noticed varying sweep times 
&gt; between AM &amp; FM on other 
&gt; &gt; models.  Not sure if the actual rate of sweep differs, for just 
&gt; the amount of channels there is 
&gt; &gt; to be swept on one band versus another, so it takes longer to 
&gt; complete one full cycle.
