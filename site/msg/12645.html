<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank,

Please excuse me if I appear confused... but I am. How am I shunning 
contact with you?  Did I miss something?
Did you send me something or call me and I did not receive it?

Thanks,
Mike

&gt;  UFO Geek lives like an hour drive to the south of me, calls 
himslef a &#x27;Ghost Boxologist&#x27;, yet seemingly shuns contact from 
the &#x27;Ghost Box master&#x27;--wierd.   I know I can come across as a total 
dork on e-mail, but that&#x27;s can be deceiving. Or-perhaps being a The 
Princess, some fear gayness, which I ain&#x27;t even though girliness is 
difficult to completely mask. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I&#x27;m guessing there&#x27;s some fear of repercussings for making boxes, 
but I have often stated there are many ways to do this stuff, as well 
as different methods to use raw audio, such as white noise, DRV, 
running water, EVPmaker or foreign language--IT&#x27;S ALL THE SAME! The 
concept is the same, provide something for entities to form voices 
out of and they will speak. I am also not the only &quot;one from the 
stars&quot; here, many of us have these dual--or more--personalities.  Ya 
never really know who you are talking to. I also don&#x27;t jump on the 
usual paranormal BS everyone else repeats-endlessly. Most of that 
stuff is urban myth and legend passed off as facts. Now, I&#x27;m felling 
really far behind, since I don&#x27;t even have a podcast!   Just a 
thought--of course, that&#x27;s working without tools again. I mean I can 
be brain dead, it never occured to me to use other digital radios 
until the hack boxes came out, and it was like DAH! Which lead to 
improvements in sound quality. I have to use pre-made radios since my 
home radios are C-R-A-P-P-Y! Another reason why I can&#x27;t mass produce 
this junk. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I know it really pisses people off by the way I give some of the 
boxes out, but I can&#x27;t make many--so I have to go on intuition-sorta 
kinda- as to who gets them. It seems the boxes just don&#x27;t work for 
everyone, so deciding who gets it is difficult. 
&gt;  
&gt;  The antenna shield is only maybe a half dozen turns of solid wire 
over the end of the AM rod antenna--loosly over the antenna coil,  
then the other end of the wire is grounded through a switch. The end 
of the extra wire on the antenna rod is left un-connected to 
anything.
