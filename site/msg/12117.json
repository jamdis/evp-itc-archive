Frank&#39;s box seems to really force\nall kinds of &quot;voices&quot; out of the airwaves and I am not yet buying it.\n\nDoes any one have anything constructive to say to us in regard to\nactual paranormal investigation via Frank&#39;s box, rather than mildly\nentertaining techno-tweaking? \n\nI was on a multi-group investigation at an old historical mission in\nSanta Barbara a week ago, for instance and watched the frank&#39;s box at\nwork for the first time.\n\nSure, I heard a few things that sounded obviously like radio, but we\ndid hear a very eerie woman&#39;s voice screaming when we were in the main\nchapel room, and THAT got my attention..  But everything else I have\nheard so far in the files here is not striking me as the voice of any\napparition, due to the weakness of quality. \n\nIf you&#39;re still reading this, I have to tell you I have had striking\nresults in my own home, simply letting a recording device roll, and if\nyou&#39;re not yet interested in hearing these samples, I guess you&#39;re\nmore into the box than the afterlife and that&#39;s YOU, not me! :)\n\nLOVE,\n\nKatherine."}
