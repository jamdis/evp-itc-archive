<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Less than a minute of FM, you can hear more feedback in this--feedback is
from being in echo chamber mode. At 3 seconds &quot;box---big box&#x27;, 15--seconds
&quot;Hultay gets---something&quot;, at about 23 seconds a weird one &quot;the end comes in
hours--you leave the planet&quot;, like I haven&#x27;t heard that about a thousand
times.

 I found if I lift the top panel up I kills the feedback, so I drilled some
3/8 vent holes in the sides that helped quite a bit.

 These aren&#x27;t Jack approved EVPs, so probably not real, since they are not
in digital format--except conversion to mp3 for e-mailing. This recording
started out braodcast out of the radio station analog, traveled to the radio
in analog RF, was down converted in the radio chip in analog circuits, and
the audio was recorded on magnetic tape. The EVPs are clearer from tape,
that&#x27;s why I use it, cuz digital sucks! I&#x27;d use tubes if it wasn&#x27;t for the
high voltage power supplies and larger transformers. Some worship this high
tech crap, which is killing the planet. They over estimate it&#x27;s true value.
