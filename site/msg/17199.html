<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>A simpler explanation is that, when listening to ambiguous audio, you tend to interpret the noise in the context of your current state of mind.  It is a simpler explanation to explain hearing a difference in ambiguous audio from week to week under that assumption, than to attribute the change to spirit activity in the electronics or on the media.

Seems to me.
