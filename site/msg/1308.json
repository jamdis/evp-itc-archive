Recently Ive been trying the ST method first \nthen \n&gt; continue on into the water method. For some reason the voices are \n&gt; very loud after the ST session ends and the radio is shut down. \nAnd \n&gt; a few say they prefer the water over the radio for speech. Others \n&gt; prefer the radio static. Not sure why exactly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;          \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Don&#39;t be flakey. Get Yahoo!
