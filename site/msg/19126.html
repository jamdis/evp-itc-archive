<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I sent all my good, or newer bnatteries to Rolling Hills, and was running
this box on almost dead batteries, the voltage was down to 10 volts for the
pack. That also affects the sweep. Rechargables are best, but that adds
cost, and a charger.  I have this clip-leaded to a 12 volt gel cell.  At 2
seconds, sounds like &quot;poor princess they want you again&quot; followed by what
sounds like a wierd language, can&#x27;t make it out.
