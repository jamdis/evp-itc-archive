<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Doing ghost hunts most are going into old, usually abandoned, not
maintained--or cleaned buildings. There&#x27;s mold, dust, dirt, insects, rat and
mouse droppings that contain viruses and bacteria, lead based paint,
asbestos, radon, and who knows what other toxins. No one takes any
precautions, they get this stuff in their hair, clothes, and cars, then
bring it home to their children, freinds and families, then wonder why the
kids are getting wierd deseases. Who is going to pay your health bills, the
property owners, the event promoters? I don&#x27;t think so! Still think it&#x27;s all
fun and games, a quest for fame and fortune?

 I wouldn&#x27;t go ghost hunting without a full hasmat suit, including a
respirator!

 Just tell yourselves I don&#x27;t know anything, bring your pregnant wife on
your hunts, or your newborns--couldn&#x27;t hurt--right?
