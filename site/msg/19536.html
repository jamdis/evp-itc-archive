I know what you mean. I just had to=
 return a pedometer for lack of doing research first. The stupid thing kept=
 resetting itself throughout the day. I looked up reveiews because it was d=
oing that to me, and it turns out that was a common problem with that brand=
.

With bigger purchases I do research first, not after like the pedometer.=
 Lol!
