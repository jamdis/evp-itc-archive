I would now like \nto render my opinion as to the subject of what we or anyone can do \nabout it.\n\nMy suggestion is DO NOTHING! Now before everybody&#39;s jaw hits the \nfloor, hear me out.\n\nA couple of months ago I would have been the one to lead the charge \nin the assault on this guy in the name of box justice.\n\nI can now say with confidence, That is not the way to handle it.\nLet me explain why I believe this way. Without going into a lot of \ndetail, I was a tough street kid that grew up on the streets of \nBrooklyn, I also served my country proudly for six years as a us army \ngreen beret, then to a career as a FDNY Fireman whose heart and \nhealth where both broken at 911.\n\nMy point is, I have always lived my life believing that anything I \ndid not agree with or that did not fit my sense of right and wrong\nwhether it be right or wrong, could be easily solved with aggression \nof some kind.\n\nIt took a long while and much sole searching and a lot of \ncommunication interpretation from our friends on the other side.\nBut I have come to learn that aggressive action in any form is \ndetrimental to the harmony and peace of the whole involved.\n\nGuy&#39;s like this guy on ebay do not and can not last in the face of \ngood and well intentioned people that are here and willing and trying \nto get the word of this miraculous research and spirit communication \nout to as many people as are in need or want of it.\n\nThat is how we can stop people like this bottom feeder. By spreading \nthe knowledge of this research from one person to the next. Our \nfriends have stated time and time again that any negative energy will \nbe detrimental to the communication and the research, and positive \nharmony and vibration will serve to strengthen the bridge between our \nworlds.\n\nSo even if you are not religious and do not believe in Jesus Christ \nas I do, these words ring true no matter what context they come from\nthis wisdom was spoken by my lord two thousand years ago.\n\n&quot;do not check the splinter in your brothers eye, until you have \nchecked the plank in your own&quot;\n\nTruthfully, anything we could do to sway this individuals sale of \nthese boxes would be minimal. Negativity and greed always find a \ncrack to seep through.\n\nMy suggestion is lets try a little harder to spread the word of the \nresearch and educate individuals that are or may become interested, \nthrough all the various outlets available to us on the web concerning \nthe paranormal research community. There are endless chat boards, \ngroups and forums plus websites and word of mouth. \nInstead of trying to stop this idiot from defrauding innocent \nunknowledgable people. Lets make sure the knowledge is out there for \nthem and we are here to help them and guy&#39;s like Mr. ebay will \ndisappear on their own.\n\nAnd we will not have expended an ounce of negative energy in the \nprocess.\nThat&#39;s how I feel, but that&#39;s just me.\n\nBruce"}
