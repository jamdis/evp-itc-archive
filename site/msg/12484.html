Hi Judy. I think i=

any=
thing else you might need to go along with it for EVP purposes), why not? F=
or myself, I 
just find it to be too time consuming and frustrating to go t=
hrough so much recorded 
material for so little in return, content wise, wh=
en we already have the ability (albeit in it's 
infancy) to engage in real-=
time, or nearly real-time, two-way conversations.

Yes, Sarah got amazing r=
esults and bless her pioneering spirit which helped bring us to 
where we a=
re today. I'm not sure how much of her success was her equipment and how 
m=
uch was her energy (I think we are all a component in our sessions). In reg=
ard to 
traditional EVP work, given how good many of today's inexpensive di=
gital recorders are, 
that is the route I've gone for situations where swee=
p isn't an option. I've gotten good EVP 
with my Panasonic RR-US360, the So=
ny B26, and a handful of others. I know some are 
still successfully using =
cassettes. 

I guess it all boils down to a matter of preference and the ty=
pe of EVP research that most 
interests you. As my dear hubby says, "Whatev=
er floats your boat!" ;-)

If you do decide to try Sarah's method, let us k=
now how you do.
