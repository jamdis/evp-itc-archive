<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, ever look at spider legs? To me, look like long slender alien fingers that one might see in the middle of the night as a child.  It&#x27;s not the spider, it&#x27;s those legs.

&gt; Talking to bugs is not that weird, I am guilty of it too.  I have a dislike
&gt; of spiders myself, they just creep me out.  Back about ten years ago I was
&gt; living in Northern California and I moved into a house that had spiders
&gt; everywhere!  I was practicing Wicca at the time (burn me at the stake!) so I
&gt; had a sit down talk with them.  I told the spiders that they could have the
&gt; kitchen, the hall and the guest bedroom and I would never bother them as
&gt; long as they left the rest of the house alone and never bothered me when we
&gt; shared a room.  Guess what?  The next day every spider was gone from my
&gt; bedroom and the living room and I never had a single problem with them at
&gt; that place.  I have a spider on my ceiling now and I talked to him at the
&gt; beginning of summer and I told him he had to stay on that side of the room
&gt; and he hasn&#x27;t moved any closer to my side of the room.

&gt; You can certainly tell the quality difference of that tuner you&#x27;re using, it
&gt; is very clear.

&gt; &gt;  My work room out in the garage, and spiders come in. I told them, yeah I
&gt; &gt; talk to bugs--bite me and I gas everyone of ya! They stay outta sight. So
&gt; &gt; this was recorded in the garage last night &quot;Us, (or house) Spiders Speak&quot;
&gt; &gt; at 15 seconds. Brain is not mind, anything that lives, thinks, ghost voices
&gt; &gt; are thoughts. If man thinks he is so advanced, how many can control eight
&gt; &gt; legs and spin a web? How many eyes does a fly need if there is no intellect
&gt; &gt; to process the information? Humans vastly underestimate the rest of nature.
&gt; &gt; Human ego, unjustifiable.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  These big radios make better boxes because the quality of the radio is
&gt; &gt; better. Better front end, not so easlily overloaded by strong nearby
&gt; &gt; signals, and better IF filter(the down conversion process), less surious
&gt; &gt; signals, clearer sound. Larger audio amplifiers, and less distortion.
