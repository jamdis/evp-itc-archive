<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Bruce, I didn&#x27;t mean to come across annoyed or offended by your  
comment.  I was just saying incase it came across like I was ignoring  
the box.  I agree that it isn&#x27;t a toy and to pay attention to it when  
doing a session.

&gt; Nick,
&gt;
&gt; You are a new member and a possible researcher so I do not want to  
&gt; get off on the wrong foot
&gt; It sounds like you may have taken what I said as criticism, It was  
&gt; not meant to be.
&gt; Just experienced advice. There are some researchers that believe it  
&gt; is beneficial to leave
&gt; a box running and unattended, so that our spirit friends can  
&gt; &quot;imprint&quot; to the frequency of the box
&gt;
&gt; That is not at all necessary, Spirit techs do need to imprint to  
&gt; certain boxes but do so through two way communication
&gt; you see they also imprint the energy signature of the user of the  
&gt; box also. And that can only be accomplished through
&gt; communicative interaction during a session. If the box is left  
&gt; unattended they may only accomplish half of what they need to do.
&gt;
&gt; Also I have had first hand experience with certain researchers that  
&gt; do practice this lackadaisical us of a box and had begun to
&gt; get less and less communication during attempts at actual sessions  
&gt; and eventually nothing but negative entities coming through.
&gt; I am not saying this is solely due to doing an absent session which  
&gt; is what I have come to call it, It entails man6y factors.
&gt;
&gt; But the absent session practice definitely contributes to the  
&gt; ultimate failure of communication.
&gt; Nick, it is better for you to establish solid research practices in  
&gt; the beginning that will serve to enhance your communication
&gt; skills and growth in the future.
&gt;
&gt; Remember your spirit contacts or &quot;technicians&quot; will become not only  
&gt; the facilitators of your link and communication from the
&gt; other side but they will become your trusted friends and  
&gt; protectors. you would never leave your buddy on the phone and go
&gt; on to something else while he remained on the line calling for you  
&gt; to speak with him. Our spirit friends where people just like us
&gt; at one time and the emotions we carry in the physical also carry  
&gt; over to our spirit lives.
&gt;
&gt; I hope you do not take this as preaching or criticism it is just  
&gt; experience from communicating with my own techs and friends
&gt; and gathering information on what they feel and expect from us as  
&gt; researchers.
&gt; Remember all we have to do is turn on a box and listen and record  
&gt; their job to send the communication
&gt; no matter how short the phrase or word is a 1000x harder for them  
&gt; so don&#x27;t you think they deserve a 100%
&gt; of our attention when we open the lines of communication.
&gt;
&gt; Also in closing let me say that my belief on &quot;imprinting&quot; of a box  
&gt; is for boxes like Frank&#x27;s box and the mini box, for the simple
&gt; reason that they are individually made and each carry a slightly  
&gt; different frequency range, indicative to that particular box.
&gt; The radio shack hack box on the other hand is manufactured in china  
&gt; most likely on an automated assembly line so each
&gt; circuit board is exactly like the next, this being the case I  
&gt; believe that when our friends imprinted on the first of the RS boxes
&gt; it was sufficient for most of the others. That is why people  
&gt; experience immediate communication right out of the box.
&gt;
&gt; So therefore the RS box does not need that grace period to &quot;Imprint&quot;
&gt;
&gt; These comments and statements are my own hypothesis based on my own  
&gt; extensive research with every type of box that is made to date
&gt; and I am only offering it so that it may help others to avoid the  
&gt; toil and mistakes that I have endured.
&gt;
&gt; thanks for giving me the soap box once again!
&gt;

&gt; Just FYI, I had stopped checking my email at that time and was  
&gt; trying to get someone to say something.  I usually can&#x27;t get my  
&gt; self to not pay attention to the box when i turn it on.

&gt; Nick,
&gt;
&gt; My advice as a long time researcher is not to just turn the box on  
&gt; and leave it running
&gt; unless you intend to do a session and give your friends on the  
&gt; other side that are working
&gt; extremely hard to send you the communication your undivided attention.
&gt;
&gt; It&#x27;s kind of like calling someone on the phone and when they start  
&gt; a conversation you decide to
&gt; put the phone down and focus your attention on other things.
&gt;
&gt; There are other researchers that feel that there is nothing wrong  
&gt; with this practice and do it on occasion
&gt; But I have come to the understanding that it is deemed  
&gt; disrespectful and while you may be listening with
&gt; one ear as you do something else, you will hear a loud curse word  
&gt; or nasty statement, that is their way
&gt; of getting your attention back. I have gotten numerous messages  
&gt; about the difficulty of the attempts for
&gt; them to communicate so when I turn the box on it gets my full  
&gt; attention. just some experienced advice.
&gt;
&gt; As for them telling you to close the portal, it could have two  
&gt; meanings. Sometimes they refer to box that
&gt; is turned on and in use as a portal for the simple reason that each  
&gt; time we turn a box on to communicate
&gt; it opens a direct open link between our realm and theirs so in  
&gt; essence it is an open door for anything to pass in or out.
&gt;
&gt; that is why when I end a session I always ask my technician to  
&gt; bring back any spirits that may have come through the
&gt; portal during the session and I ask for conformation and 10 times  
&gt; out of ten will get &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;OK THEY ARE BACK&quot;
&gt;
&gt; also they may have meant since you had the box running and where  
&gt; not doing a actual session to shut the box so
&gt; that they could go and not have to protect the open connection from  
&gt; any negative entities that where able cross through the open
&gt; portal.
&gt;
&gt; A few researchers have been receiving numerous messages about the  
&gt; number 7 within the past month. The only known
&gt; significance that the number 7 has in evp research is the 7  
&gt; entities that controlled communication back in the eighties and  
&gt; nineties
&gt; during the spiricom and luxembourg era. To receive this number in  
&gt; messages so often and by more than one researcher, odiously
&gt; holds some importance which they have not been able or are not  
&gt; ready to convey.
&gt;
&gt; If you need any help or have any questions please feel free to ask.

&gt;
&gt; Hey,
&gt; Anyone have any odd problems in the morning with using it. I am
&gt; sitting here checking my email so i just thought i&#x27;d turn it on
&gt; and... not check my email. Anywho.... Then right at about 6:20 i
&gt; heard a voice say &quot;Nicholas Etheridge please turn off the dsfnlsd&quot;
&gt; not quite sure what word it used... possibly portal. I just thought
&gt; it was weird. Also under all of the jumble and this voice speaking i
&gt; heard a deep male voice almost chanting &quot;seven&quot;. Not sure if I
&gt; actually heard this or its the want to have an excuse to stay home
&gt; and not take the HSAs.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway.. just curious if anyone has gotten heard this or if they know
&gt; something I don&#x27;t about using the box in the morning.
&gt;
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Nick
