However, since I have learned=\r\n \nabout you guys, and what you have all been  sharing, and with me working =\r\non \nit myself, I have not been sick.  I am  still really new at this, I onl=\r\ny \nstarted doing this since March of 09, and  I&#39;ve collected, and kept all =\r\nthe \nraw data, plus what i tried to pull out of the  files, it was harder t=\r\nhen \nbecause I didn&#39;t know how to work with it I still  don&#39;t know what to =\r\ndo with \nGoldwave, but Kristin is the one that told me about  Goldwave, it =\r\nis easy to \nsave files, and just recently I learned how to make the  wav fi=\r\nles mp3&#39;s most \nof the older files are still in Wav format.\n \nAll  i do now=\r\n, is make their words louder, and try  to pull them out, from \nthe other vo=\r\nices, that get in the way.  As far as  &quot;listening to negative  \nentities&quot; l=\r\nook at what goes on in this world, don&#39;t  we have enough negative \nstuff to=\r\n worry about already?  I just don&#39;t enjoy  encouraging them to keep \nit up,=\r\n feeding into the negatives only makes them  stronger, and does not \nset a =\r\nvery good example it&#39;s like what a philosophy  professor once told a \nclass=\r\n back I took one, students could  understand him, oh yes, he spoke clearly =\r\n\nperfect English, but the man spoke 8  languages fluently, wrote several \nb=\r\nooks;  &quot;I speak to lift this  class up to my level of understanding, so you=\r\n \nwill learn, I will not  lower myself to your level, you are all here to \n=\r\nlearn.&quot;    Difficult class?  Very much so, and no student ever managed to g=\r\net an  \nA or B in his class one was lucky to get a C + in that class, and I=\r\n had 3.9 \nin  all of my undergraduate work, and a 4.0 in what PhD credits I=\r\n \naccumulated.   But of all the science classes I took, the biology&#39;s, chem=\r\nistry&#39;s,  \ntheology, physics, all of them, that was by far the most challen=\r\nging  ever, but \nboy was it interesting! sf\n \n \n \nIn a message dated 6/2/20=\r\n10 2:28:19 P.M.
