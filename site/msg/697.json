The work that you will see mostly on this evp group is done at home and not for &quot;ghost hunting&quot; per say, rather making contact with those on the other side that are able to make contact. We have people here that are in constant contact with &quot;groups&quot; on the other side and relatives. Frank receives communications about events people etc as well.
