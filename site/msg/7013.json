So consiquently \n&gt; the files will sound different, and I think many of Frank&#39;s \n&gt; box files get better as the box is used more by the reasearcher\n&gt; and has time to be imprinted by the spirit technitions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; So the communication with a Frank&#39;s box is like wine, it gets\n&gt; better with age. This particular box is performing excellently\n&gt; on the first session, it holds special promise of possibly being\n&gt; the best box Frank has ever produced.\n&gt;  \n&gt; More files to come!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: lisby@...: Thu, 7 Feb 2008 19:38:04 -0500Subject:\nRe: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m hearing something like &quot;I can build it&quot; on this one. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Feb 7, 2008, at 7:18 PM, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com  wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,This email message is a notification to let you know thata\nfile has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC group.File :\n/*Bruces Box Files/ FB#29 files /8_HOW YOU DOIN.wav Uploaded by :\nbhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; Description : 8_HOW YOU\nDOIN.wav You can access this file at the\nURL:http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/%2ABruces%20Box%20Files/%20FB%2329%20files%20/8_HOW%20YOU%20DOIN.wav\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please\nvisit:http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfilesRegards,bhali333\n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Need to know the score, the latest news, or you need your\nHotmail-get your &quot;fix&quot;.\n&gt; http://www.msnmobilefix.com/Default.aspx\n&gt;"}
