The \n&gt; amplified speakers are from OEM Electronics here in town.  They have \n&gt; tons of used parts, of all sorts.  It&#39;s a place the size of a grocery \n&gt; store with aisles and aisles of used electronics stuff. Sets of used \n&gt; speakers go for around $10.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;judy_in_hollywood&quot; \n&gt; &lt;Ticket_to_Heaven@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In \nHi Mike,  Can you give me/us the make & parts # of the mixer & speakers, so I can try to locate the same items online somewhere???

I got a brand-spanking new audio mixer today for $8, so I \n&gt; just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; had to put a new Radio Shack Hack configuration together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; See it here: http://ufogeek.com/?p=182\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    Hi Mike!  Wow! I really like the \n&gt; 2 speakers & the small mixer you show on your photo!!  Where did you \n&gt; get/find the mixer (for $8) and the 2 speakers (how much)???  I have \n&gt; a RS 12-469 that I hacked. I have &quot;El Cheap-o&quot; $1. dual speakers, but \n&gt; I have to put the dynamic mic right next to them + put the RS Hack \n&gt; volume to max, to record! Not the greatest, but it works. Let me/us \n&gt; know, thanks!!   8-))  =Judy=\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
