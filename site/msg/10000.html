<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No one would expect you not to resell it in the &quot;real&quot; world. $400 is  
a lot of money, as I know, since I paid it, too. You reselling it,  
even at a profit if the eBay market will bear, hardly constitutes  
filthy lucre in my book.

Just MHO. That&#x27;s all.

&gt; Ann,

&gt; Thank you for your support. Anyone that knows me, knows I have  
&gt; given away my fair share of boxes
&gt; to further the cause and help others get started in this wonderful  
&gt; research.
&gt;
&gt; I have given and not even asked for the postage to be paid.
&gt; But I payed a considerable ammount for the minibox as anyone that  
&gt; owns one has.
&gt; And I am still taking a loss, my only motivation here is that  
&gt; someone get the box that will give it the
&gt; attention that it deserves. But I would like to recoupe some of  
&gt; what I paid.
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t think that is wrong, and do not see why I or any of my  
&gt; friends should have to defend it.

&gt;
&gt; Oh, and I want to jump in here and say that if anyone thinks that  
&gt; Bruce shouldn&#x27;t try to get his investment in his mini back on ebay  
&gt; or any other sales venue, I suggest practicing such charity oneself.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A few people have seen my ebay listing and commented about the price
&gt; &gt; listed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ebay will not allow you to change a description after the item has
&gt; &gt; been listed. They do however allow you to add and amending  
&gt; statement.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Which I have done In Big Bold Red Letters, the price listing was a
&gt; &gt; mistake. I am certainly not trying to misrepresent the item or  
&gt; make a
&gt; &gt; profit on it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have also lowered the reserve price on it as a result of the
&gt; &gt; mistake.
&gt; &gt; Believe me I will be taking a loss on the box.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have already sent my apologies to Rick Moran from Paranormal
&gt; &gt; systems.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And now extend my apologies for the mistake to anyone that was
&gt; &gt; interested in it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The reason for selling the MB was not the money, it was the guilt of
&gt; &gt; having this excellent piece of equipment go without the attention it
&gt; &gt; deserves. And the hopes that someone or some group can utilize it
&gt; &gt; more than myself.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But I could not as much as I would have liked to, give it away.
&gt; &gt; My intention was to get back at least a decent amount of my
&gt; &gt; investment.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hope no one gets the wrong idea and thinks ill of me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bruce
