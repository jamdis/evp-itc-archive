I did buy a 20-125, and \nhacked it correctly, and I didn&#39;t like it. I also didn&#39;t get very much reception. The 20-125 \nhas a long anntena, and the 12-469 you can hold it in your hand, and you act as the \nanntena. That way you get better reception. Only problem with the 12-469 is that it \nclicks a little, but I can&#39;t hear it anymore.
