While I&#39;m not new to paranormal experiences, I am\npretty new to the science of it. I recently bought a Radio Shack 12-587\nbelieving that I could just bend the pin to make a ghost box. When I got it\nyesterday and opened it up I didn&#39;t find any pins. Instead I had a ribbon of\nwires. I cut the one that said &quot;mute&quot; and it didn&#39;t work. The radio works\nthe way it&#39;s suppose to but not as a hack. Got any ideas to try?\n-- \nVicky\n\nHello. I'm new he e. While I'm no new o pa ano mal expe iences, I am p e y new o he science o i .
