<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I see what you&#x27;re saying below. I may be waaay too caffinated today  
to be allowed near a keyboard. Your last paragraph is very and  
explains your position nicely. Might have been nice if I had read it  
correctly the first time. :(

&gt; If 30 people listen to your EVP recording and they all (100%) hear

&gt; the recording real? Just a coincidence?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If we all sit in a theater and watch the same movie, we might like  
&gt; it or not, form 100&#x27;s of different opinions about the movie, but  
&gt; the movie is still real.
&gt;
&gt; No matter what we do as researchers, there will always be someone  
&gt; to attempt to say what we do isn&#x27;t real.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve seen people experience paranormal activity, objects move and 5  
&gt; other people besides them witness the same thing, the exact same  
&gt; thing, only later to hear them later make excuses for what they  
&gt; saw. So no matter what proof we present, there&#x27;s always someone  
&gt; around to poo poo it - usually a person who has never actually  
&gt; researched EVP/ITC themselves ever.
