Hi Lizzie,=

Sorry to hear about your mom going across the Rainbow Bridge, she is proba=
bly in what is known as "the rest plain" right now, it's too soon after her=
 passing, when she is ready she will wake up over there, become fully consc=
ious of everything around her, then she will be shown her book of life with=
 her guardian angel, and go meet up with her loved ones, after she learns h=
ow to communicate, she will no doubt come through and speak to you.=C2=A0 S=
he is alive, in another dimension, and is safe. sf
