I have a week off from school and actually have some time to say hey. Still need to read back through the posts to catch up.\n\nSince Halloween is right around the corner, I&#39;m checking around for an investigation to participate in. Not that Halloween has anything to do with it! Well okay, a little. \n\nSteve, Ralph, Tracy, any interest in getting another investigation under way? Is Tanya still kicking around here? \n\nRegards,\n\nMark"}
