&gt;         I am sorry but I dont know/remember who hes here for. Might
be someone from the other group. I had these messages come through
before listening to others recordings when I was a member there and I
cant remember who it was but it was important to someone off the board
at the time. But his name wasnt exactly Brandon it was something that
sounds similar but I hear it as &quot;Bran-den&quot; while they hear it
differently. So I am posting this here hoping it finds its way to his
mother as well as forwarding this to anyone I think may remember. The
part about a guest today for sumption makes me think its someone in
this group but this group wasnt here when I had heard it last time. I
dont know.
&gt;    
&gt;   I had a &quot;pop in&quot; from them during a session the other night but
with all the drama things have been fuzzier so today I decided to use
a newer method and I keep getting mom messages. I dont have any
children so something tells me Brandon and his friend are back to let
thier moms know they are around.
&gt;    
&gt;   Some of these are very hard to hear and I&#x27;d apologize if there was
anything I could do about it but theres not so if nothing else take
the message from the filename and leave it at that. Perhaps others
will hear more than my ears do. It&#x27;s always hard to say if anyone can
hear the fuzzy ones.
&gt;    
&gt;   Some of the new session are clearer. Hopefully its a good sign
that communication will improve soon. Its a method that only recently
started working even tho they had me trying it for months with no
results... so I dont use it often. 
&gt;    
&gt;   They were bugging me to contact Sonia Rinaldi again, but I still
have no clue how to do that. At least this time I know shes a real
person LOL. They want us to share methods/contacts. I been gettin
those messages for like almost a year now and I havent bumped into her
yet so I can only assume maybe the opportunity will present itself in
the future. Until then I just post the info how I do stuff for anyone.
&gt;    
&gt;   I am not even sure she speaks english and they were speaking
another language after they say her name and I cant understand it at
all. So whatever it was it wasnt for my ears to understand.
