The constant clash of ego&#39;s and childish bickering of which I \nhave become a big part has begun to affect my research in a negative \nway.\nI have been advised to retreat from being an active part of this \ngroup for an undetermined amount of time. I would like to stay on the \nrolls as a member but will not actively participate as far as posting \nresults, files or opinions and advice.\n\nI will however be posting the results of my research on my box website\nif there are any of you who would like to hear them.\n\nhttp://free-paranormalinvestigating.com/franksboxjoesbox/\n\nFor the new members, please do not let my comments on this matter \naffect your opinion of this research. I have chosen not to \nparticipate here for personal reasons. I will be devoting all my \nenergy to advancing the communication and technology.\n\nIf any new members feel they value my advice please feel free to \nprivately e-mail me paranormalinvestigating@...\n\nI will be glad to help anyone but will not offer advice on any \nsubjects posted here.\n\nThank you to all the friends that I have managed to make here you \nhave been an immeasurable help.\n\nThank you\nBruce Halliday"}
