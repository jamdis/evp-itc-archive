Depending on who you&#39;re speaking&nbsp;to, some even describe &lt;EM&gt;what it =\r\nwas like&lt;/EM&gt; when&nbsp;the planet Earth was destroyed, speaking as though =\r\nit has/had already occured.&nbsp;There would also be dimensions in which th=\r\nis event has already occured thousands of years ago, 5 minutes ago, 3 days =\r\nfrom now and 10,000 years into the future and every other possible scenario=\r\n. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;So which one is the RIGHT one then? &lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Well, I think they all are. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;Because &quot;they&quot; live in a world of &quot;source energy&quot;, light, consciousne=\r\nss and perfect&nbsp;information fields...one that&#39;s&nbsp;so completely and =\r\ntotally different to our own experience here/now&nbsp;and are&nbsp;not limi=\r\nted by linear time and local/non-local space&nbsp;or relativity like we are=\r\n, it&#39;s likely very difficult for most of the beings we would speak to throu=\r\ngh the box to give us specific information regarding such an event or the e=\r\nxact time (or even &quot;which Earth&quot; they are referencing, dimensionally speaki=\r\nng!). &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In other words, they don&#39;t experience a=\r\nny of this stuff (and especially&nbsp;&quot;time&quot;) like we do. &nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;To end,&nbsp;for several years&nbsp;now I&#39;ve been&nbsp;a=\r\n devoted care-giver to the ancient quartz&nbsp;crystal skulls&nbsp;of Mayan=\r\n legend&nbsp;and much of the mythologies and folklore surrounding these obj=\r\nects is focused around 2012 and the impending&nbsp;Great Shift. I&#39;ve also&n=\r\nbsp;studied South American culture (past and present), anthropology,&nbsp;f=\r\nolklore&nbsp;and tribal customs along with&nbsp;their indigenous wisdom sys=\r\ntems in&nbsp;varying&nbsp;depth with the Kogi Indians, Quechua Curanderos a=\r\nnd residents of the Amazon. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;For many years I =\r\nfollowed the work of Terence McKenna&nbsp;rather closely and Terence is som=\r\neone I consider a man-genius far ahead of his time (may he rest in peace). =\r\nHe developed a time-mapping system based on the I-Ching, the Mayan Calendar=\r\n, Great Pyramids, DMT-beings, fractals, plant consciousness&nbsp;and other =\r\nmathematic systems&nbsp;that showed a sharp spike followed by a near-perfec=\r\nt &quot;dip&quot; before it went off the charts and moved into &quot;nothingness&quot; complete=\r\nly around December 21st, 2012...and even Terence didn&#39;t think this is when =\r\nthe world would end, necessarily. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;(His &quot;offic=\r\nial&quot; position is that he simply didn&#39;t know what to make of it or expect. O=\r\nne theory is that his algorithms reflected such a change during a time&nbsp=\r\n;that humanity may have finally broken the time/space barrier and uncovered=\r\n the keys to time travel and 4th dimensional plane-shifting, to name just o=\r\nne possible solution.). &nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I&#39;ve also been =\r\nfortunate enough to live in Swaziland, South Africa with the Swazi, Zulu, X=\r\nhosa&nbsp;and San Bushmen tribes who (like most other cultures throughout t=\r\nime and history)&nbsp;also have their own teachings and mystery traditions =\r\nsurrounding&lt;BR&gt;this and other events. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Given t=\r\nhat the San are the most ancient tribal peoples and humanities oldest ances=\r\ntors still living in the world today and whose incredible healing knowledge=\r\n, spiritual wisdoms and mystical practices far exceed any I&#39;ve ever heard o=\r\nf or personally witnessed anywhere else in the world and they don&#39;t seem to=\r\n feel that life on this&nbsp;planet&nbsp;is going to end anytime soon, so I=\r\n&#39;m not going to panic just yet. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;These amazing=\r\n people have their ears pressed up very closely to the heartbeat and rhythm=\r\ns of Mother Earth and told me firsthand that before the end comes certain e=\r\nvents will take place on a scale the whole world will be instantly made awa=\r\nre of...events that could still take several hundred or even thousands of y=\r\nears to unfold.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;All I know for my own self, pe=\r\nrsonally, is that I have no clue what&#39;s going to happen...but it will be ok=\r\nay, no matter what takes place. There are worst things than dying, believe =\r\nme...and part of what makes our work with the Ghost Box and ITC in general =\r\nso helpful and inspiring is that we can find a level of peace and comfort t=\r\nhrough our sessions and recordings we might actually need one day, whether =\r\nsoon or in some distant time - we&#39;re all going to end up there eventually, =\r\nno doubt about it! &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;FINAL NOTE:&lt;/STRON=\r\nG&gt; I don&#39;t have all the answers...I don&#39;t even have all the questions, and =\r\nI know it. My guess is as good as any and I could be completely and totally=\r\n WRONG about all of this (I&#39;m open to that and&nbsp;I&#39;m perfectly fine with=\r\n it). Believe you me, if the world ends when a lot of&nbsp;folks think it m=\r\night I&#39;ll be just as surprised as anyone. Until then I&#39;ll keep doing what I=\r\n do now; realizing that I don&#39;t know a damn thing, taking life as it comes =\r\nto me day by precious&nbsp;day, treating it with respect and honoring&nbsp;=\r\nmy experience here&nbsp;as the gift it is, loving others, being good to the=\r\n people around me&nbsp;and enjoying my family and time spent here while I c=\r\nan. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;And I won&#39;t be afraid...not even for one =\r\nsecond or when I&#39;m looking up and seeing that big f***ing rock heading righ=\r\nt towards us, hahaha. For all I know (or anyone here for that matter), I co=\r\nuld be blindsided by a Mac truck later this evening! &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Many of the people worried over 2012 won&#39;t even be here when 2012 a=\r\nrrives...now how&#39;s THAT for a mind-f**k!?!?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;;)=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-J&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Mon, 12/20/10, Urkel=\r\n23 &lt;I&gt;&lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc1110.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Durkel2=\r\n3@...&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;urkel23@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; w=\r\nrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: Urkel23 &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc1110.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compos=\r\ne?to=3Durkel23@...&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;urkel23@...&lt;/A&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: A bit of validation \n&lt;DIV class=3Dyiv10849348=\r\n58yiv729929017im&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc1110.mail.yahoo.com/mc/comp=\r\nose?to=3DEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;EVP-ITC@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Date: Monday, December 20, 2010, 4:10 PM \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dyiv1084934858yiv729929017h5&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Frank,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Remember last year when we both g=\r\not the August predictions?
