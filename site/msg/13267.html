Reading the posts from the last week as I do every sat m=

a joy to do research with I hope it stays that way I would hate to s=

it become one of "those" boards if you know what I mean (my 1 cent had =

One productive idea that I saw from one of this weeks=
 posts was to send 
the same file privitly to a few people and see what the=
y hear in it. 
Unpromtide by file names or other posts about it. I have a c=

that I feel are pretty clear. So if you would like to voluntee=
r just 
send me an email with your email adress and I will send you a file =
not 
too long but it will be unedited and in its original form.
I will not =
amplify it or edit or change it in anyway from its original. 
Those who rec=
ive the files do the same NO editing untill
 you render 
your opinion to me=
 about it after that you can do what u like with it.
Remember after listeni=

board I will do that later wh=
