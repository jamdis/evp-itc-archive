Thanks Steve I appreciate your answering my question. I have listened to lots of files I do feel like I am starting to get an ear for the spirits talking verse just the radio.

There's definitely a learning curve to hearing the messages when you 
start out, but you will start to differenciate them given some time. 
The harder you try, the better they will communicate with you i 
believe. It takes an effort on both sides, but most of your files so 
far have been pretty good. I'd say you're heading in the right 
direction and when i comment on a file; that's just my 
interpretation on how i hear it and in no way am i stating that i am 
right.
