I made a  \n&gt; solder bridge from the pot to one of the resistors.  It sounds nice now,  it&#39;s \n&gt; an AM only box for now.  I had it sweeping both, but FM sucks on this  \n&gt; radio.  I did a 1 minute test audio, so you guys can hear how it  sounds.  All i \n&gt; have to do is cut the shaft on the pot and put the knob back  on and it&#39;s \n&gt; done, that should take a couple minutes tomorrow at work.  Here  are a couple \n&gt; files from the sample test i did.\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Steve Hultay\n&gt; _www.keyportparanormal.com_ (http://www.keyportparanormal.com/) \n&gt; _http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/_ \n&gt; (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/) \n&gt; _www.stevehultay.com_ (http://www.stevehultay.com/) \n&gt; _www.rtscresearch.org_ (http://www.rtscresearch.org/)\n&gt;"}
