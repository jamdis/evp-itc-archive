Yeah-very similar to what I hear. After listening to it for a while, I thin=
k I hear "Find tape record" or "Fine tape recorder."

The interesting thing=
 about that is that the girl with me was using an analog tape recorder that=
 had been malfunctioning periodically during this particular vigil.

Still =
waiting to hear back from her about that.

        It sounds li=

        A mistake that a lot of people m=
ake is thinking that there are two different types of energy at work when i=
t comes to sound waves and electromagnetic waves. The only thing that seper=
ates them is frequency and power. Radio waves are radio waves because they =
occupy a certain block of the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves exist =
on that same spectrum just farther down with much longer waves. Soundwaves =
and subsonic waves can penetrate almost anything because of their wavelengt=
hs. The shorter the wavelength the more ways we can shield against them.

 =
       Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and telemetry tr=
ansmitting wave but the waves also have a physical effect on our environmen=
t by causing molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A little lower than=
 this is IR or infrared it too can cause physical objects to heat up but us=
ually it just causes molecules to rotate in place. All physical things give=
 off IR light. Its a way the total system conserves energy by spontaneously=
 emitting IR radiation.

          Here is some f=
ood for thought. I am currently reviewing my audio from our May 30th invest=
igation.

          It was me and another girl teammate present in the room=
. I picked up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry =
with me. We were standing right next to another digital video recorder that=
 I leave beside my night vision camera. That recorder did not pick up this =
3rd voice. I have asked the girl that was with me to check her recording to=
 see if she picked it up.

          I have long felt the true EVP does not=
 come from sound waves in the environment, or then it wouldn't be EVP, but =
a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are appearing directly on the recordings=
.

          This instance with the recorders may back that theory up. That=
 other recorder should have picked that voice up if it were sound waves in =
the environment.

          I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The =
file that is named "01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip. You will hear my voice=
 as I say "Yeah", and then another comes in right after that. I think I kno=
w what it says.

          Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still=
 did not hear this until playback. It isn't clear, so I am not as excited a=
bout it as my one's from the last investigation.

                  I have a running theo=
ry that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where =
they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix=
 two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequency then if you add =
or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. =
For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electr=
ic fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will ha=
ve a intermediate difference frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing r=
ange (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic equipmen=
t generates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I =
always felt that EVP were generated within a few inches of the recorder.

                 We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radio wit=
h superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some pass=
ive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Jos=

                     I am curious if anyone with a microphone wired to a re=
