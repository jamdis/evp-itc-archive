I think we  have all experienced \nthe difficulty in hearing what is on s=\r\nome  of these recordings: sometimes \nwe&#39;re not sure at first what it  says.=\r\n Sometimes we ask others for their \ninput.  Sometimes  we only hear it once=\r\n someone else tells us it first.   \nSometimes we hear it wrong.  Sometimes =\r\nwe hear it right.  And so on.\n\nIt would be useful to know, as an  individua=\r\nl, how good we are at hearing \nit right, so we have  some idea how trustwor=\r\nthy our skill, or methods, or  \ntechnology, is.  If we can measure that, or=\r\n even get a  feel for it, we can \nlook for ways to improve it.  If we  can&#39;=\r\nt measure it, then we could be stuck. \n \n\nSo, by  restricting the answers o=\r\nnly to the timeframe of the  experiment, \nwe can help filter out some of th=\r\ne problems of  subjectivity: for example, \none theory is that people can he=\r\nar  what they want to hear, or can these \nsounds in a certain way,  once yo=\r\nu already know the answer.  Or, given 2 ways to  \nhear a sound, being influ=\r\nenced, even subconsciously, to hear  it one way \nover the other.  We want t=\r\no rule that  out.\n\nThis is one reason we can only count on answers  given d=\r\nuring the \ntimeframe.  That is when the answer is  most objective.  Once th=\r\ne object has been \nannounced, we  move into a  period where we can&#39;t discou=\r\nnt possible  influence \nfrom already knowing the answer.\n\nBut, I am  confid=\r\nent that if a person&#39;s method or technology really can  \nreveal the correct=\r\n answer outside the timeframe, then doing it  within the \ntimeframe should =\r\nbe just as easy, and would then be  a valid objective result \nfor all to se=\r\ne.\n\n--- On Wed,  7/14/10, SnowfireL@aol. com &lt;SnowfireL@aol.  com&gt; wrote:\n\n=\r\n\nFrom:  SnowfireL@aol. com &lt;SnowfireL@aol. com&gt;\nSubject:  Re: [EVP-ITC] Exp=\r\neriment 20100710 - RESULTS!\nTo:  EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\nDate: Wednesday, =\r\nJuly 14, 2010,  2:50 PM\n\n\n \nit doesn&#39;t  matter, it&#39;s in the whole file, I d=\r\nidn&#39;t think it was  possible \nto have a radio sit on top of a pc screen i  =\r\nguess.

Sometimes we ask others for=\r\n their input.&nbsp; Sometimes \n                  we only hear it once someo=\r\nne else tells us it first.&nbsp; \n                  Sometimes we hear it wr=\r\nong.&nbsp; Sometimes we hear it right. \n                  And so on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;It would be useful to know, as an \n                  individual, how good =\r\nwe are at hearing it right, so we have \n                  some idea how tru=\r\nstworthy our skill, or methods, or \n                  technology, is.&nbsp;=\r\n If we can measure that, or even get a \n                  feel for it, we c=\r\nan look for ways to improve it.&nbsp; If we \n                  can&#39;t measur=\r\ne it, then we could be stuck.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So, by \n                  restr=\r\nicting the answers only to the timeframe of the \n                  experime=\r\nnt, we can help filter out some of the problems of \n                  subje=\r\nctivity: for example, one theory is that people can hear \n                 =\r\n what they want to hear, or can these sounds in a certain way, \n           =\r\n       once you already know the answer.&nbsp; Or, given 2 ways to \n       =\r\n           hear a sound, being influenced, even subconsciously, to hear \n  =\r\n                it one way over the other.&nbsp; We want to rule that \n    =\r\n              out.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is one reason we can only count on answers \n=\r\n                  given during the timeframe.&nbsp; That is when the answer=\r\n is \n                  most objective.&nbsp; Once the object has been annou=\r\nnced, we \n                  move into a&nbsp; period where we can&#39;t discoun=\r\nt possible \n                  influence from already knowing the answer.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But, I am \n                  confident that if a person&#39;s method or te=\r\nchnology really can \n                  reveal the correct answer outside th=\r\ne timeframe, then doing it \n                  within the timeframe should b=\r\ne just as easy, and would then be \n                  a valid objective resu=\r\nlt for all to see.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Wed, \n                  7/14/10, Snowfi=\r\nreL@aol. com &lt;I&gt;&lt;SnowfireL@aol. \n                  com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;\n                  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE                       style=3D&quot;BORDER-L=\r\nEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: \n                    SnowfireL@aol=\r\n. com &lt;SnowfireL@aol. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: \n                    Re: [EVP-=\r\nITC] Experiment 20100710 - RESULTS!&lt;BR&gt;To: \n                    EVP-ITC@yah=\r\noogroups .com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Wednesday, July 14, 2010, \n                    2:50 =\r\nPM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n                    &lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1951680305&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; =\r\n\n                    &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n                    &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT colo=\r\nr=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n                    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;it doesn&#39;t \n                    mat=\r\nter, it&#39;s in the whole file, I didn&#39;t think it was \n                    pos=\r\nsible to have a radio sit on top of a pc screen i \n                    gues=\r\ns.&nbsp; But, I know He did say it, that&#39;s all the proof \n                 =\r\n   I need. haha! &lt;G&gt; would you like the whole 4 minute \n             =\r\n       question the whole tape?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n color=3D#000000 size=3D2                       face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n                    &lt;DIV&gt;\n                    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000=\r\n000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;In a message \n                    dated 7/14/2010=\r\n 5:46:11 P.M.
