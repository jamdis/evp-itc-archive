          Hi Kay. Your boyfriend's opinion is one of the reasons why I put great weight on relevance 
of content in a session. For example, when I recently asked for Rees' great uncle to say 
his name, and an immediate reply of "It's Chuck Clarke" is heard (even though Rees 
referred to him as Charlie, both are nicknames for Charles) I think the odds would be quite 
astronomical of that being coincidence. Same goes for any of us asking a question, any 
question, and receiving a relevant response ... it would be highly unlikely for it to be from 
stray signals (of whatever flavor.) 

Then again, if he has trouble even hearing and/or agreeing on the content, it's going to be 
hard for you to get him to view an answer as relevant, even when it is.
