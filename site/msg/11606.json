Do you have a site or any files?\n\nAaron\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rebecca&quot; &lt;harvesthearth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m Becca, and I&#39;m a new member to the group. I live in S. GA. I&#39;m a\n&gt; wife, mother of one, artist (photographer, and professional\n&gt; soap-artisan). I&#39;ve had a life long interest in the\n&gt; supernatural/paranormal/occult. I&#39;ve looked into joining a few local\n&gt; paranormal groups which have sprung up this year, but thus far haven&#39;t\n&gt; entered membership level with either. Soooo, instead of just being\n&gt; stagnant and doing nothing, I&#39;m interested in putting together more\n&gt; equipment/&quot;know-how&quot; from a techie standpoint of view for doing my own\n&gt; investigations with family and close friends. (Pretty much all members\n&gt; of my family are interested in this sort of phenomenon.) I have a very\n&gt; techno-knowledgeable husband who could pretty much put together\n&gt; whatever equipment we need. Of course, being that we&#39;re pretty much a\n&gt; one income family, the more we can build ourselves, lowering the cost,\n&gt; the better. ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; I have lots of side interests, background, etc. but that sorta covers\n&gt; where I&#39;m coming from.\n&gt; \n&gt; And yes, I&#39;m finding all this information (out &quot;there&quot;) so over\n&gt; whelming!  Trying to figure out the right place to start. I do plan on\n&gt; having my techie-hubby check out Frank&#39;s schematics, because I do hear\n&gt; over and over that his box is still &quot;da&#39;bomb.&quot;  :D\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; Becca\n&gt;"}
