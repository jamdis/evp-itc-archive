Bruce,
  I just wanted to drop a line and say Amen!   Granted, the electronic element is the "e" in EVP (and the "i" in ITC), but the most accomplished researchers (including Maggy and Jules, Konstantin and Friedrich, and yes, Mark Macy, insist that if you have the harmony, love, and RESONANCE among researchers, all the electronic problems can be overcome.  
  Is anyone involved in the AA-EVP "Big Circle" group?  I see that they attempt contact all at once from their own homes around the country, I think on Thursday evenings at a set time.
  Is anyone interested in this?  From what I see, and from my own new interest, it seems most of us try contacts as much as possible throughout the day.  Anyone want to try a set time?
  Ursula

Forgive me for bluntness, but typing in all capital letters is 
considered to be shouting by some of us. It's also hard to follow. 

Absolutely no offense intended... I just thought you should know.

Thanks,
Lance
