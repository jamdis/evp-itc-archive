&gt; by the way since no one is listening to this file (or it appears any of my files lol)..thought you may wanted to know not blowing my own horn or anything Im very proud of this file..I have been asked if could be used in a class for explain of commucation and crossovers. So I think the ones especially who are crossing would like this fine..Just a thought..or not. but umm its super clear and its in real time..
