This is exactly what I expect it to mean. A change in some sort of cycle.

  From what I have read from people who =
study the Mayan calender is that 2012 is just a point in time that a large =
astronomical shift happens. It doesn't point to disaster or anything else. =
These events have happened in the past and will happen far past the 2012 da=
te. It is the doomsdayers and second-coming types who place the dark meanin=
g to the date. 

  They describe these astronomical events as things like e=
clipses, solor cycles, or comets and such. No legitimate study of the calen=
dar has ever predicted a doomsday event.

  Not my information, just what I=
 read on the subject.

  Thanx,

         F-S, I certainly hope I didn't offend you with anything I said.  I=
 certainly do not claim to be a braniac or a know-it-all, as you have calle=
d me in your post.

          In fact I am saying the opposite: I am saying=
 that I do not know:  I am saying I do not know how anyone can believe thes=
e 2012 predictions when all they have is stories and questionable claims.  =
I don't know how they can believe this stuff when they actually DO have evi=
dence that all the similar claims in the past have been shown to be false. =
I do not know why they believe this claim is any more justified than all th=
e others,

          I do not know how the group can say on its home page "=
 It's one thing to be skeptical, it's another to ignore and deny all eviden=
ce.", yet it is the people who are certain of the 2012 prophecies that seem=
 to be ignoring and denying evidence that it is only one more in a long lin=
e of unsupported failed predictions, not those who are skeptical of it.

  =
        I do not know how it justifies you referring to me as  a "wanne be =
brianiacs claiming to know all", when the group home page suggests such att=
acks get people banned.  I do not know how being skeptical of a future prop=
hecy makes one a know it all. And I do not know how prompting people to jud=
ge for themselves makes me a know it all. 

          And I don't know why =
the group home page says a good argument is ok, yet you start name-calling =
offended when someone questions something you do not agree with, or propose=
s a theory alternate to your own.

          So call me ignorant.  Obviousl=
y I really don't know very much at all.  

          But of the very few th=
ings I do know, I now it is good to question, and not take everything, espe=
cially prophecies, at face value.  And I know the best way to test a prophe=
cy, and the people making them, is to see if they actually come to pass.  A=
nd I know that since no evidence can support a prophecy's truth until it co=
mes to pass, and since all past end-of-world prophecies have no evidence of=
 their success, that those who think they know something special about why =
2012 is different, certainly know more than I.

          And so I hope the=
y (or you, if you count yourself among them) will post your evidence, and y=
our predictions, and your dates.  And we won't have to argue about it.  We =
can just put that person, and their predictions, and their dates, on our ca=
lendars, and judge when the date comes, who was really acting as a know-it-=
all.  

          One thing I think we can all agree on:  one knows it all.=
 Not me, not you, and certainly not a collapsed MesoAmerican civilization.
