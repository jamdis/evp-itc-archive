Was about 3 miles out-have recorded here before (Vandel=\r\nia). This time my recorder was acting up (DR60). The REC led indicator woul=\r\nd flash sometimes (supposed to remain steady) and I would notice that the t=\r\nimer would stay in place for sometimes 5 seconds before it would change up =\r\none number....I though I had broken it somehow. I did hear lots of LOUD spl=\r\natter noises on playback while in the field. My battery indicator showed 2 =\r\nof 3 bars, but I went in to town and got fresh AAA&#39;s anyway. I then went to=\r\n water trough and the flashing still happened for 2 recordings here. I then=\r\n said for the &quot;bad guy&quot; to leave and stop messing with my recorder. Well th=\r\nen on my 3rd attempt....recorder started working fine. After I finished the=\r\n 3rd recording I packed up and went to the fairgrounds (just a spur of the =\r\nmoment) *I thought..... so at fairgrounds I recorded for a little over 10 m=\r\ninutes (I stopped at an old -church/school/\n courthouse- (single room log c=\r\nabin-multiple uses back then) that was used in Debuke Iowa during 1823 (thi=\r\nnk was date). And I also asked questions around 2 other reconstructed build=\r\nings from long ago. Well I got home....when my recorder was acting up in co=\r\nuntry I find a Male evp say &quot;Get Out Of My Face&quot;. I think he was guy messin=\r\ng with my recorder.... ....Then while at the water trough (recorder still a=\r\ncting up even with 2 new batteries) I finally get it to work (after telling=\r\n what I think followed me &quot;to leave&quot;). At the end of my last recording (the=\r\n good one) from this water trough, I hear a little girl say &quot;come to the fa=\r\nir....someone said&quot; ***So I didn&#39;t go to the fairgrounds uninvited*** I jus=\r\nt decided to go for know reason I had guessed. Well what I am so &quot;disturbed=\r\n&quot; about now......... is that while I was playing these other recordings I A=\r\nCCIDENTALLY- ERASED my 10 plus minutes of recording from fairgrounds BEFORE=\r\n I even got a chance to listen or\n download it. OOOoooowwww! !! :) Makes me=\r\n mad. No telling what could have been on there. I was INVITED&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shucks! ! =\r\nI will upload the &quot;get out of my face&quot; as the little girl is way to quite t=\r\no hear. The guy is not so quite-but is still LOW audio.
