<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ok, I can discuss most anything within the realms of respect. your  
insults show your true nature. Perhaps you should find a list that  
welcomes insults and sarcasm. Most of us here on this list are serious  
researchers that deserve respect... even if you don&#x27;t agree that what  
we record is legitimate. That said, there&#x27;s no point in continuing  
conversation or attempted debate with you.

What&#x27;s ludicrous is arguing with someone who doesn&#x27;t think much of  
your research to begin with and bases his own belief on the heresay of  
others, religious myths and fairy tales instead of concrete evidence  
that is worthy of further research.

Perhaps this isn&#x27;t the list for you?

&gt; I don&#x27;t know from whence you get your ideas from, but they are  
&gt; ludicrous. To believe in sitting over a radio listening to radio  
&gt; fragments and then joyously clapping their hands when a &quot;researcher&quot;  
&gt; believes (usually this is just the &quot;researcher&quot; placing their own  
&gt; beliefs into whatever they think that they hear) over thousands of  
&gt; hours and years of research by mediums and other legitimate  
&gt; researchers is inconceivable.
&gt;
&gt; I have said this before and I will say it again, that listening for  
&gt; radio fragments is NOT communication in any one&#x27;s book. It is not  
&gt; legitimate. For true communication to take place there has to be an  
&gt; exchange of ideas, a communication has to be established.  
&gt; Information has to be exchanged. Has there ever been a true exchange  
&gt; of information given through ITC...yes, but those are far and few  
&gt; between. Konstantin Raudive is one example...bloody few others. The  
&gt; difference between Raudive and listening to radio fragments are a  
&gt; world apart!
&gt;
&gt; I am afraid that being involved with ITC has more to do with  
&gt; emotional and psychological needs than any form of reality, let  
&gt; alone legitimate research!
