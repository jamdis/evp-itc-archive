<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ahh, heard someone that seemed to be saying you were acusing us of charging $500, I can see that was a misunderstanding. Yeah, I try to get it across that &quot;the box&quot; is a friggin&#x27; radio! You don&#x27;t even have to have any fancy sweep, you can sweep a simple cheap radio by hand while recording from the speaker and get exactly the same results and communication. Not only that, it is one method of supplying &quot;raw audio&quot;, there are other ways that work as well, and some better. Try tuning an AM radio between stations on a night when skip is coming in--distant stations fadding in and out randomly. Annouce you/re doing an EVP recording and record from the pseaker. BTW, you do not have to go to haunted locations! No doubt, get rebuffed for that as the experts know better.


 I try to charge enough to be able to buy parts, as far my labor, I don&#x27;t get squat! Less than a dollar an hour. Some seem to think we should give the stuff away, even pay shipping, at least that&#x27;s what I hear from others making this junk. Believe me, making boxes is a fraking hassle I no longer want. Some users seem to get a few voices and all the sudden they are the world&#x27;s only box expert. I can&#x27;t say anything without pissing them off, or geting some angry response, while I&#x27;m just supposed eat up what they say. I can be moody, but this shit just ain&#x27;t worht it. I get midnight e-mails that make no sense what so ever, and I can&#x27;t even question what the person is saying, yet I&#x27;m the bad guy for for getting angry with that. Screw it!

 When I think I&#x27;ve reached my saturation point--it gets worse! 

Frank-s

&gt; you&#x27;ll find lots of recipies in here. Just don;t be dumb enough to buy one 
&gt; exorbitantly priced. I ahve seen some of these guys trying to pawn off
&gt; boxes for 500.00. You will need to know how to open a radio and maybe pull a 
&gt; circuit board out and snip a wire.
