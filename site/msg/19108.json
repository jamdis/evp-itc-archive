The\n&gt; majority of my experience comes from working with Chris (Moon) and his box\n&gt; for the past 3 years. The results still never cease to amaze me!\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyhow, I came across this device at an estate auction. It appears to be an\n&gt; antique communication device of some sort. The only verifiable information I\n&gt; have is that is was probably built around 1910-1912, which is before radio\n&gt; was publicly available.\n&gt; (I obtained this date from researching the packaging cylinder used to build\n&gt; the device.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone have any thoughts on what it might be? I did show this device\n&gt; to Chris a while back and he agreed that it probably was a communication device.\n&gt; He also suggested I show it to Frank... = )\n&gt; According to Chris&#39;s box, &quot;this *IS* a communication device of historical\n&gt; value.&quot; It also mentioned the device was &quot;meant specifically for me to have,\n&gt; but no longer worked.&quot; There was more, but I&#39;m trying to remain unbiased and\n&gt; only use tangible evidence. However, I have little to go on.\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone has any clues or can lead me in a research direction I would\n&gt; appreciate it!
