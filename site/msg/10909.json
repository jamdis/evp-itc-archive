I can simpathize with the \ncost of chips. I have the same problem with pre-made tuners, like using \nthe 12-469 as a tuner module in a box. I have one more SJ chip I want \nto use after these next boards. As usual I&#39;m trying new ideas, like I \nused to use a ground bus around the outside edge of the boards, it was \nconvinient, but I&#39;m not sure if it wasn&#39;t causing some ditortion and \nnoise, so I&#39;m trying more of single point ground on these two boards I \nstarted Saturday night.  \n\n Frank-S"}
