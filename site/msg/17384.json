That&#39;s cool on a test.

My Dad used to always call me &quot;Stevie&quot; so that might be him, could  \n&gt; also be wishful thinking i suppose.  But the help file is very clear.   My \n&gt; Dad passed away last November, my guys keep telling me that he is helping  \n&gt; over there.  I hope that it&#39;s true, but i&#39;m sure nobody will hear these  \n&gt; except maybe Frank.\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Steve Hultay\n&gt; _www.keyportparanormal.com_ (http://www.keyportparanormal.com/) \n&gt; _http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/_ \n&gt; (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/) \n&gt; _www.stevehultay.com_ (http://www.stevehultay.com/) \n&gt; _www.rtscresearch.org_ (http://www.rtscresearch.org/)\n&gt;"}
