<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>What!!? What&#x27;dya mean somebody&#x27;s gotta go? Over some comment? Does anyone 
remember how many arguements I&#x27;ve started, or gotten in over the years? I 
think y&#x27;all need to back the tape up and chill.

&gt;Steve,
&gt;I know that your post about &quot;begging for a box&quot; was directed at me.
&gt;Frankly I am insulted, I thought we had developed a somewhat off the
&gt;group friendship. Your response to my post to frank for a box was not
&gt;begging but I believe that your obvious attempt at ass kissing is
&gt;more insulting to frank than my asking for a box. it seems to me that
&gt;you are afraid that I may get a box before you do and that for some
&gt;reason you deserve one more than anyone else. I don&#x27;t understand that
&gt;being you already ripped off franks design and had some one build you
&gt;a number of boxes on your own. As far as serious evp research goes I
&gt;have dedicated many many hours, much more than you have I&#x27;m sure to
&gt;evp research and other forms of itc. matter of fact if anyone takes a
&gt;look at your site the couple of dust orb pictures you have and the
&gt;only evps I have heard are recent ones gleaned from the boxes you had
&gt;made do not make you a dedicated seasoned pro at PI. I also remember
&gt;not long ago you contacting me for advice and asking to join my team
&gt;so in some way you must have recognised my professionalism. I will
&gt;end by saying, If you want a box from frank be honest and ask like I
&gt;did instead of trying to cuddle up next to him with your own version
&gt;of his box and make it like you care about his feelings or protecting
&gt;him from any annoyances. who made you the frank police anyway. steve
&gt;just be real lets all work together and help each other do not try to
&gt;sabotage anyone else hoping to further your own ambitions, you work
&gt;with auto parts all day while I am doing evp research so you tell me
&gt;who is more qualified to work with the box me or you?
&gt;
&gt;I hope I didn&#x27;t piss anybody off this is just my opinion!
&gt;
&gt;bruce
