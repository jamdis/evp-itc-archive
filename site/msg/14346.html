Goldwave can do those things too. I have been using Goldwave for years, and=
 it is very good for low-priced software. I tried Audacity, but didn't like=
 interface as much, by that is just my preference.

  Hi, give the AUDACITY software another try. Has option to =
slow the recording down. Another nice feature is that you can use either a =
highpass or lowpass filter (sometimes that is all that is needed) and chang=
ing the PITCH is a very handy tool. Always KEEP an original copy of your re=
cordings. I just save a copy from inside audacity (to desktop or somewhere)=
 then I will start my work on trying to clear it up. Save the original (and=
 proceeding enhanced version(s) by using the "file" button at to left corne=
r oif program. There you would SAVE "selection" as MP3.(To upload to here) =
or save to WAV (is bigger) but higher qulity. Can always convert the wav to=
 mp3 from withing audacity also. *you will need to get the mps "pluging" fr=
om the website, and follow the information to install it "manually" (once i=
s only needed) that way you get the mp3 converter program free. But really.=
..Audacity is a pretty good program to have round. Has a nice "undo" fesatu=
re too, if you make a mistake. Happy Hunting ;) Jim H --- In EVP-ITC@yahoog=
