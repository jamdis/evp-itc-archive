<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ann.  I&#x27;m a MAC user (OS 10.4.x).  I don&#x27;t know if you use Audacity, but that program 
will change your audio output from 44100Hz to 96000Hz.  This will prevent sound from 
working on some sites.  For me, YouTube is a good example.  I have to reset my sound 
almost every time after using Audacity (I&#x27;ve created a shortcut on my desktop to make it 
quick and easy).

I don&#x27;t know if this will work for you, but try this path:  Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Audio 
MIDI Setup (launch this application).  Then on the right side, under the words &quot;Audio 
Output&quot; there is a pulldown menu after the word FORMAT.  If it isn&#x27;t 44100Hz, change it to 
this setting.   It took me forever and day to figure out what the problem was on my 
system.  Hope it works for you.  If this doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m out of suggestions.   ;-)  Margaret

&gt; I dont use a MAC pc, should be same as any other from here. Sounded like maybe she 
had a browser conflict. I would suggest she try going to the site then click on file and 
when it goes to the page that plays it, right below the file it has a download button. Click 
that and see if it will let ya download. If the website is not loading for you at all then 
definitely a browser conflict. But the downloads should work same as they do on this 
group

&gt; 
&gt;       Well, I tried to listen to your files and I can&#x27;t. Maybe it&#x27;s a Mac thing, but I cannot 
hear anything on esnips and never have been able to. Unless someone can tell me why and 
help me overcome what is an absolutely shocking technical ignorance on my part, I can&#x27;t 
hear nothin&#x27;!

&gt;  
&gt; I agree with you 100% but lets be democratic and give the esnips method a try.
&gt; I suggest after 1 month evaluate what members think about it and decide what to do 
from there.

&gt; 
&gt;         Bruce,
&gt;               I have to agree with you.  Given the file folder shortage, I deleted all of my files 
to give the new comers room.  I hated to do that, given if anyone wanted to revert back to 
my clips, they could in fact do so and now that can&#x27;t.   I also hate to have to send someone 
a link to find my audio on an additional sight.  
&gt;    
&gt;               Maybe we could comprise and say after &quot;x&quot; amount of days, upon new files being 
uploaded we could clean house?  I know that not everyone will take it upon themselves to 
do this, but if they don&#x27;t (after an announcement from the groups caretakers), if they 
disappear, its their own fault.
&gt;    
&gt;                I personally like the single emails announcing each file.  I can go straight to the 
audio clip and not have to search through previous clips I have already listened to. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Just my thoughts!

&gt;       Yesterday I decided to post some files so I posted to a sub folder of 
&gt; my main folder in the files section.
&gt; I noticed that some people voiced their dislike of sending post notices 
&gt; for every file , so I sent none. Just a single post stating that I had 
&gt; posted the files and where they could be found.
&gt; 
&gt; Now this is the dilemma, If you do not post an announcement for each 
&gt; file and you trust that the single post announcing all the files that 
&gt; have been posted will suffice, well I don&#x27;t think so!
&gt; 
&gt; I know that most individuals here do not listen to or reply to every 
&gt; single file posted but I will usually get some comments on the better 
&gt; or more interesting ones. So far from the posting yesterday &quot;NADA&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone saw the post I wrote announcing the files I posted to the 
&gt; files section, please for my own satisfaction let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; Otherwise I don&#x27;t think the one post notice thing is gonna cut it!
