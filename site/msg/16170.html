Ok, see if this is better I made them louder, I know her voice very well,  
this is my great aunt Hazel Ransom Lilly, Bruce she passed in the late 80's 
I  took care of her for many years before she died, the other male voice is 
her  husband Ralph, he died in CA in the 70's, I think he was shot by 
accident, she  moved back here to MI not long after his death, and came to live 
near us, she  was my grandmother's sister, my mother's mother's sister.  Here 
is a  picture of Hazel.  This is her voice, I swear it is her voice, and 
it's no  "radio signal.".
sf
 
Hazel in  her younger day.
