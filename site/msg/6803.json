I put in all \nthe volume controls and jacks tonight, then added a meter driver so I \ncould tell where the tuning voltage was if I use manual mode. It&#39;s \nalready to test now. \n\n Frank\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Wow that was fast!\n&gt;   I agree, just have to let it happen.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;            I made one today, same as the last except I can adjust \nthe sweep level, and where in the band the sweep starts, or do manual \nsweep. I used to put this function in the boxes, but no one used it, \ntoo busy asking stupid questions, or showing the world what great \nmediums they were cuz they had a box,  so I started leaving it out to \nsave parts, and front panel space. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I don&#39;t think you can force, or coerce spirit, I&#39;ve always thought \nit best just to allow. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Curious--these are for me a change, and they are flying together. \nNever before have I made a board in 24 hours, it required only a \nslight shift in the concept.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;   Climb to the top of the charts!
