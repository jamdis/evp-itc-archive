<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The Mad Scientist In Me Comes Out On Full Moons :)

Has anyone other than me hooked their ghost box up to their TV&#x27;s using video jacks? If so what was your results? 

I disconnected the cable box, inserted the two jacks into the TV and one into one of my 12-470&#x27;s. The TV went flipping through the channels and my husband and I heard someone yell &quot;Gab Quit&quot; really loud the other night through the TV. My dogs went in circles howling both times, and my husband swears it made him light headed. So he ask me not to do it again with him and the dogs in the house. I didn&#x27;t record it, as it was a spur of the moment mad scientist ideal, but I think I will put them out of the house one night and record it on video. Just wondering if anyone else does it?
