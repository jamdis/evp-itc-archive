&gt; Hi Frank,
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;d love it if you could take a look at it for us so you give us  
&gt; guidance, we&#x27;re not experienced at this type of stuff and I&#x27;d feel  
&gt; much better if we were shown what /where/how. We don&#x27;t want to  
&gt; interrupt your holiday, but if you&#x27;re not a big New Years fan even 
10  
&gt; minutes of your time would be great.
&gt; 
&gt; If you&#x27;re still willing to take a look, where would you like to  
meet?  
&gt; You can give me a call, the number below is my home business. 
Don&#x27;t  
&gt; know where in Littleton you are, but I usually meet clients at the  
&gt; Starbucks in Aspen Grove. There&#x27;s another Starbucks at Broadway &amp;  
&gt; Littleton Blvd. I&#x27;d  need to make sure they&#x27;re open today.
&gt; 
&gt; If you&#x27;re busy, I understand. We&#x27;ll just do our best!

&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s farily straight forward to repair, you can tell what 
conductor
&gt; &gt; goes to what conductor on the board. It&#x27;s just a matter of making
&gt; &gt; little jumpers with small wire to bridge the breaks. Radio shack 
has
&gt; &gt; #30 wire wrap wire that works well for that kind of stuff. Maybe
&gt; &gt; there&#x27;s enough of the original pad left on the connectors that you
&gt; &gt; could glue them back in place, then jumper the breaks. I could 
look
&gt; &gt; at it tomorrow, as well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  There&#x27;s a green coating on the circuit traces called solder 
mask,  
&gt; &gt; you&#x27;ll have to very gently scrap some of the mask off to solder 
on a  
&gt; &gt; jumper wire. You&#x27;ll see the copper colored conductor under the 
mask.  
&gt; &gt; Then you aplly some solder to conductor, and some to the wire, 
then  
&gt; &gt; heat the two togther to join them. Watch out for solder bridges  
&gt; &gt; between conductors.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Frank,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;d heard you were in Littleton -- is there any chance you could
&gt; &gt; take
&gt; &gt; &gt; a look at this in person and tell me how to fix it? I had a 
feeling
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; was going to be a serious problem, but since its messed up 
already
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; guess I have nothing to lose. I could bring it by your place or 
we
&gt; &gt; &gt; could meet some where convenient to you if you have a few 
minutes.
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have a pointy tipped soldering iron that&#x27;s made for smaller
&gt; &gt; electronic
&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff and have a background in botanic illustration so I&#x27;m used 
to
&gt; &gt; &gt; working on details. If I could get some guidance from you I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; willing
&gt; &gt; &gt; to try myself.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ouch! That redish colored torn stuff is a circuit trace torn 
off
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; board, it&#x27;s green colored on top, and copper colored on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; underside.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Those are surface mount connectors, and wires would have to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soldered on the connector tabs, then spliced onto the board. I
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know if I can solder anything that small with the iron I have.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hate advertise it, but I&#x27;m in Littleton.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, one of my DIY projects this weekend has been to 
convert my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; husband&#x27;s old Olympus to infrared. We&#x27;re not extremely 
talented
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electronics area, but we have fun and seem to muddle by. No
&gt; &gt; guts no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glory, huh?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, for the most part the operation has been a success. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; photographed every step of the way and taped screws and 
parts
&gt; &gt; to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; photos so we&#x27;d know how to rebuild everything we took 
apart, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has worked just fine. I located the IR filter, removed it 
and
&gt; &gt; cut
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; replaced it with a piece of glass slide.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The one problem we ran into is that there were two wires 
that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appeared
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be clipped in place as opposed to being soldered or 
screwed
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything else. When we tried to pry the clips open, 
instead
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whole thing came off the circuit board. WE HAVE NO CLUE HOW 
TO
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PROCEED
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FROM HERE. I don&#x27;t know if we can just glue the darn things
&gt; &gt; down and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if so, what type of glue to use, or if we&#x27;re just plain up 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; creek.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I immediately thought of this group of brainy electronics
&gt; &gt; buffs. I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hoping someone out there can give us some advice, or if you 
live
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Highlands Ranch, CO, you could help in person &amp; bail us out 
of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was hoping to take this camera to the St. Augustine 
Lighthouse
&gt; &gt; at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; end of this coming week.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any hope? I&#x27;ve posted a photo of an extreme 
closeup of
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clips (one is pink, the other is ivory) and the damaged 
board --
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to sandwich two photos together to get both in focus at the 
same
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (that&#x27;s why it looks that way). For an idea of scale, the 
clips
&gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both the same size, about 4 mm in width, 4 mm tall, 3 mm 
deep.
&gt; &gt; Not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy to handle and even harder to see with these middle age
&gt; &gt; eyes.
