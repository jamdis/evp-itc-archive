&gt; I think you&#x27;d be better served to try the simpler methods first, 
if those 
&gt; don&#x27;t work, chances are a box won&#x27;t either. I think almost 
everyone is 
&gt; basing their expectations of the boxes on Moon&#x27;s claims, which may 
be highly 
&gt; exaggerated. Besides, it&#x27;s not Like I can just throw this stuff 
together, 
&gt; despite Moon telling the world I give it away. I give away the 
proto types 
&gt; I&#x27;m done with, and don&#x27;t have any at the moment.
&gt; 
&gt; Many of the other methods work as well as my stuff, such as 
EVPmaker, the 
&gt; various direct radio voice methods.  They have a huge advantage--
simple and 
&gt; cheap! I swear, all I do  is the same, provide a source of raw 
audio.

&gt; &gt;Mr. Sumption, I would like very much like to receive information 
as to 
&gt; &gt;acquiring one of your Boxes. I am a serious, independant 
Paranormal 
&gt; &gt;researcher, Not! a de-tractor of your instrument, not by any 
means. I 
&gt; &gt;mention this here because I&#x27;ve followed the various exchanges of 
&gt; &gt;information, and &quot;information,&quot; concerning your instrument. I&#x27;ve 
reviewed 
&gt; &gt;the sound bytes posted and am very impressed with the results. I 
would 
&gt; &gt;appreciate a responce, one way or the other, from you at your 
convenience. 
&gt; &gt;Thank you in advance.   --Rod
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;           I never paid much attention as to which boxes produced 
more 
&gt; &gt;negatives, but I
&gt; &gt;used to get alot when I first started this stuff. I tend to 
ignore those,
&gt; &gt;and sometimes if it&#x27;s in a segment I copy to the computer I&#x27;ll 
play it
&gt; &gt;backward. Reversed, sometimes the evil voices are angelic. That&#x27;s 
curious
&gt; &gt;about it shutting off aplliances, I thought those ran on internal 
&gt; &gt;batteries.
&gt; &gt;Maybe you&#x27;re getting a lesson in energies?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I did get a quake warning in last nights test, it said China 
suffers a
&gt; &gt;quake, followed by August 11. I usually don&#x27;t get dates, or 
locations, so I
&gt; &gt;guess wait any see, of maybe they can evacuate China? Often, when 
a quake 
&gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt;coming I get a wolf image, well there&#x27;s a wolf face on the shower 
window,
&gt; &gt;kind of a medium size wolf, so I think if there is a quake it 
won&#x27;t be real
&gt; &gt;severe, maybe like a 6 or 7. Wolves for quakes, cats for wind, 
and bears 
&gt; &gt;for
&gt; &gt;tsunamis, which I didn&#x27;t know ahead of time. For Katrina I had a 
cat(image)
&gt; &gt;with huge round eyes.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Does anybody think it&#x27;s possible to get 2 extreme opposites in
&gt; &gt; &gt;communication? 1 Box curses at me constantly and tells me to 
die and
&gt; &gt; &gt;also talks about the end of the world and hell. And the other 
one
&gt; &gt; &gt;talks about how pretty it is there and i always get &quot;Hi&quot; 
and &quot;I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; &gt;Here&quot; as well as &quot;Don&#x27;t leave&quot; when i&#x27;m signing off and an
&gt; &gt; &gt;occasional &quot;Goodbye&quot;. Has anyone experienced anything like this
&gt; &gt; &gt;before? The 1 box even shuts off appliances in my house when i 
use
&gt; &gt; &gt;it, i guess i&#x27;ll stop using that one for now until i figure out 
a
&gt; &gt; &gt;solution to what&#x27;s going on. Any ideas?????
