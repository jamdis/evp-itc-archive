OK I have a radio now. Can someone tell me what I need to do.
   
  I have an old manual dial radio that has fm/am
   
  So I turn the radio on to lets say fm or am
   
  Do I just turn till i find an area in between a station and listen?
   
  I have listened to some of your evp's on the web site. Did any of you hear those evp with your ears, or did you have to tape the area in between stations with the digital recorder and then play back to listen if you captured something?
   
  Any tips would greatly be appreciated.
