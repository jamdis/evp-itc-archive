Combinations of the above are also heard \nIMHO. It seems all over the board to me, yet, some of the responses \nbeyond &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; appear to be quite intelligent.  I am still \nstymied as to how any of this could even work at all, but I cannot \ndeny some of the responses I (and others) have recorded.  Beyond \nthat, my spirit guides who I have been hearing for a decade, have \nbeen on me to work on this.\n\nThe only way I see that I can personally know for sure, is to develop \na relationship and connection, hopefully realizing consistent \ncommunication that intelligently replies specifically.  It needs \nproven to me...personally.\n\nAll of my audio from this point forward will be direct recorded, \ntrimmed from the original only, and normalized at 60db.

A few years back I\n&gt; set up an experiment with about 10 people. Some did set time and set\n&gt; place. some set time, different place, some completely random times\n&gt; and places, etc. The results were inconclusive and the dedication \nfrom\n&gt; the experimenters was not as I had hoped it would be. \n&gt; \n&gt; What I would like to see you add would be a timer. Is there a\n&gt; consistent time between words, responses, etc.?\n&gt; \n&gt; My whole thought process is in developing a way or set of tests,\n&gt; protocol, etc to eliminate as many other possible causes as we can. \nI\n&gt; know we can&#39;t eliminate everything due to the simple fact that we \nare\n&gt; using radio signals but, if we can attempt to keep it as natural as\n&gt; possible and try to introduce some scientific methods. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have listened to many of your files and do find them compelling.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your thoughtful reply.\n&gt; Babs\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Babs,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I cannot answer many of your questions yet, as I am experimenting \n&gt; &gt; with different set-ups, methods, etc.  It is I who have a set-\nperiod \n&gt; &gt; of time set aside for these experiments...and with good reason.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My personal feelings are that there needs to be a commitment - \n&gt; &gt; something for the other side to rely upon with respect to me.  \nThat \n&gt; &gt; expectation can then build to better audio responses-questions.  \nIf \n&gt; &gt; we think we can spot shoot this like EVP and develop consistent, \n&gt; &gt; good, 2-way communication, I suspect we are in error.  I \nunderstand \n&gt; &gt; the same radio shows are going on at the same time, but I am \nlooking \n&gt; &gt; beyond that.  It is my hope that once solid contact is proven, \nthat I \n&gt; &gt; can move beyond my current set-times.  Personally, I want to hear \n&gt; &gt; intelligent replies that cannot be random chance.  Several of my \n&gt; &gt; recordings have convinced me, and they are in my files on this \n&gt; &gt; board.  Two of them I will mention specifically:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) 11808womanghostvoice2.wav: The response I received from a \nwoman&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; voice over top of the audio.  This was not radio jibberish, but \nmore \n&gt; &gt; like an EVP.  The woman&#39;s voice was loud, and slowly annunciating \nthe \n&gt; &gt; message for me to be able to hear it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) phonecallthatsbrucebruce11808.wav: I had asked a question \nabout \n&gt; &gt; someone receiving a phone call.  In the audio, you can \nhear, &quot;Phone \n&gt; &gt; call? Bruce. That&#39;s Bruce.&quot;  I ask, &quot;Am I going to receive the \nphone \n&gt; &gt; call?&quot; and the response is not a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no,&quot; but \nagain, &quot;Bruce.&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; That would be very hard to receive by chance, in my opinion.  \nYou&#39;ll \n&gt; &gt; need headphones to hear it, but it&#39;s there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regarding the processing of audio, I am now moving to direct \nrecord \n&gt; &gt; with only trimming the audio segment out of the entire recording, \nno \n&gt; &gt; cuts, and only normalizing it to about 60db.  An example of this \nis \n&gt; &gt; the recording I made and uploaded this morning \n&gt; &gt; entitled, &quot;spiritsspeakchuck12108.wav.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Babs, you are going to have to experiment on your own and come to \n&gt; &gt; your own conclusions, I suspect.  That&#39;s what I am doing...trying \nto \n&gt; &gt; find what works for me and proves (to me) that I have broken \n&gt; &gt; through.  You sound frustrated with the results you have had so \nfar, \n&gt; &gt; and I understand (especially with the 12-469). However, I do \nbelieve \n&gt; &gt; there is more than one person (or even 30 people) who will be \nable to \n&gt; &gt; do this consistently. Also, I would say that to believe only \nrandom \n&gt; &gt; vs linear sweeps of the band will work, does not remove any of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; same possible errors you propose, really. ;)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In all, it&#39;s coming along I feel, but more experiments will need \nto \n&gt; &gt; be done.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; http://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;babiarz3&quot; &lt;babiarz3@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Alright, you all know I&#39;m vocal and I haven&#39;t made \nany &quot;friends&quot; \n&gt; &gt; here\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but, if we can put that aside for a moment...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirit communication has been my passion since day one, a \nlittle \n&gt; &gt; over\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6 years ago. I am a believer in the afterlife and a believer in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spirits attempting to communicate with us for a variety of \nreasons. \n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have spiritual beliefs that I feel strongly about and devote \nmuch of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my waking (and sleeping) moments to thoughts about this field.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I am also a researcher and a skeptic. In order for me \nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; allow ideas to become part of my reality I must experiment. In \norder\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for me to believe something is paranormal I HAVE to rule out \nall \n&gt; &gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible causes. That being said, I have some questions. My \nhope is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that there are some here willing to enter into discussion with \nme.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a difficult time with many of the files here. Many \ntimes, \n&gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is no question included in the file. I can not determine \nwhether or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not the &quot;reply&quot; is an intelligent reply. Maybe this has to do \nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; allowable file size.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some of the files I have been able to download. (I don&#39;t always \nkeep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my email settings on for this group as I get too many - lol) \nWhen I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; look at the file I see problems. There will be complete flat \nline\n&gt; &gt; &gt; silence between the words. Many times the &quot;reply&quot; is also at \nthe \n&gt; &gt; same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; decibel as the question askers voice. Those two things should \nnot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; occur naturally considering the devices being used. That tells \nme \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is manipulation of the files. Now, what is manipulation \nto me,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may not be manipulation to others. To me, any altering of the \n&gt; &gt; recorded\n&gt; &gt; &gt; file constitutes manipulation. I do not know if the reply was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent or manipulated to be intelligent. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some say that they simply remove the &quot;no response&quot; time. I&#39;ve \nbeen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; told it can be as much as 18 seconds removed from between \nwords. Now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we run into the problem of us deciding what word fits in with \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; question. What words are being ignored?  Did we take nonsense \nand \n&gt; &gt; make\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sense? Did we amp every noise/word or only what fit?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s great that files are offered for peer review. \nHowever, \n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think we have to load them untouched or at the very least, offer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exactly what was done to the entire file. Time elapsed between \n&gt; &gt; words,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what was amped, etc. I&#39;d also love to see some of these \nsessions \n&gt; &gt; video\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taped with the question asker facing the camera and a second \nhand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; clock visible. Truly, we aren&#39;t researching if we don&#39;t have \nsome\n&gt; &gt; &gt; protocol in place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is an issue I have with the RS Hacks. I have the 469. It \ntakes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approximately 18 seconds to scan through the AM frequencies. \nNow, \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; typical person would think that we can take that 18 seconds and \n&gt; &gt; divide\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it by the number of AM stations to determine how long we are on \neach\n&gt; &gt; &gt; station before moving on to the next one. In that way we could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; determine what is impossible to be said via a radio fragment. \n&gt; &gt; However,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one frequency \nto \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; next and of course the biggest problem is that some stations are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; picked up over multiple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard on \n630, \n&gt; &gt; 640,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 650, 660 and maybe even 670. That extends the time a great \ndeal. \n&gt; &gt; This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is a difficult problem because it is almost impossible for the \n&gt; &gt; average\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person to be able to make a determination on time this way. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I heard about the following today; An experimenter records at \nthe \n&gt; &gt; same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importance of \nmeditating,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but what we \nhave \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; remember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning into \nthe \n&gt; &gt; same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; radio show every day. One of my first experiments with the 469 \nhad \n&gt; &gt; me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hearing this deep male voice over and over again. What was he \ntrying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to tell me, I wondered. Than I realized that he was speaking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approximately every 18 seconds; every time the scan hit that \n&gt; &gt; station.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, if you are removing up to 18 seconds between words, then \nyou are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really only recording the words from one station. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides \ndiscussion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about some research problems. I know that there are those who \nare \n&gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; concerned with anything more than the communication itself but \nI \n&gt; &gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it is of the utmost importance to attempt to factor in some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; protocol in order for this to be considered serious research at \nall.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
