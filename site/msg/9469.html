I can see how this is possible.  The other day I finally had success using FM on the old 469 and then switched to AM.  When I went to load it onto the computer it says the file is 68hrs 26min long.  This recorder is only 256mb and at max will hold 11hr 20min, so this was quite crazy.  I only did a 13 minute session, not to mention the file size is that of 13 minutes.  I can listen to the file on the recorder and on the computer, but only in a media player, not in a sound editing program.  It's very strange because I had some great communication going on.  

I keep thinking that maybe it's some sort of glitch with the recorder.  I've tested it multiple times and can't duplicate the problem.  Who knows, could be anything.

Rees, it's nice to hear you had some great communication going.  Don't be too upset.  You'll always have the experience of the session and that is what's most important in my mind.

                Hi Rees,

Audition can recover an unsaved session in case the program (or
computer) should crash.

But perhaps it was intention that the session was not saved - who
knows... paranormal phenomena are often elusive by their nature.
