I uploaded the pages about spirit communication.

I tried the scanner but =
the quality was actually worse and the files we 20MB :)

I realized that yo=
u might want to see the other pages of this chapter.

Some of them are a li=
ttle fuzzy,again because of the age of the book, it was difficult to get so=
me of the pages flat.

I could still read them so you guys should be able t=
o.

You might have to download them so you can rotate the image though.

I'=
ll uploaded those pages later.

            Thanks Don!  Though I expect the qua=

scanner, I am able to read what you uploaded=
 after zooming in a couple
