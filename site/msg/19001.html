1st off walking into the cem or building I'll say I'm sorry and have resp=
ect to 
those who passed.Then I'll ask for the evil spirit who is in charge=
 to show or 
make their selves known..The provoking gets to the point that =
I'll call the evil 
spirits "Pussy fucks that only can harm those who have =
passed and hurt the 
children"..for the facts that we catch childrens evps =
asking for help...When we 
got those evps we went in with oils for healing =
and to keep bad spirits away 
bought from a store that was straight from je=
rusilum,where Jesus was born.As 
soon as we got there and called out for th=
e evil prick who hurts the souls of 
the kids,we got threating evps,KII was=
 pegging out,along with ice cold spots 
while it was in the upper 80's.I fi=
nd in every cem.we go to there seems to be a 
strong dark presence thats in=
 charge,that wont let spirits roam free.We've NEVER 
gotten skunked evp wis=
e....When leaving we always demand nobody pass the gate 
',no-one is allowe=
d to come with use.We had something follow us as well as our 
other 2 inves=
tigators home.I as well as tme other guy felt sick when 
leaving.Sick for 6=
 hours,I pet our cat and felt fine all of asudden..1/2 hour 
later we thoug=
ht where the cat,we found her lifeless eyes pouring out like 
puss.Took car=
e of her and when we woke up all our cabnet doors were open with 
lights on=
.Our fellow investigator called with the same at his home.Their dog 
freak =
out and killed 1 of their cats..We took the oil and placed crosses over 
al=
