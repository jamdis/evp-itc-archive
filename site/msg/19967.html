<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just the Ten commandos, Gods word, how come they never mention there was
613 commandments. That many, and you can&#x27;t sleep, can&#x27;t think, can&#x27;t eat,
can&#x27;t read, can&#x27;t question, can&#x27;t breed--it&#x27;s all fear crap cuz some bozo
was trying to guess what some imagined deity wanted. I think the &quot;gods&quot; of
sumeria are closer to the truth, they went away, and some duffus was trying
to figure out what we have to do to bring them back.  Only only one thing to
do...wait.

&gt;   totally agreed it IS hacked to death..we don&#x27;t even have the full
&gt; version that has been edited time and time again..Don&#x27;t get me wrong i
&gt; believe in God..I&#x27;m a spiritualist..but i do not subscribe to everything
&gt; that comes out of the bible..and if one really no the Bible they wouldn&#x27;t
&gt; either you can&#x27;t do this sorta of thing and say ooo I&#x27;m soo holy...because
&gt; in the bible eyes we are sinner..communicating with the dead..that&#x27;s why
&gt; when i see people on here saying Jesus is talking to me it makes you
&gt; wonder..

&gt;   Yeah, and funny watching the sci dorks trying to debunk it. I think it&#x27;s
&gt; like biblical, even though I don&#x27;t believe in that stuff too much. Not that
&gt; the bible is wrong, just hacked all to hell.

&gt;  That&#x27;s possible. And what if someone had set off a bomb in the upper
&gt; atmosphere causing this problem? That&#x27;s one of the theories floating around
&gt; out there on the web. Between the birds, the fish, and the crabs, I don&#x27;t
&gt; know what to think of it all, but your message could have been about that.
