It seems less muffled (higher \ntones?) or something...  ;) \n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  I wanted to compare the two boxes, I just finished a galvanized \nsteel box, that scrap metal I get from work. I did the same as the \ncopper box, try to select the best sounding speaker for it. The use \nit with #33. I like the steel box better, I think last night, the \nclearer voices had more to do with conditions thant he equipment. Or--\ncould it be the other way around, tonights conditions are poor for \neither box? It gets frustrating cuz ya can&#39;t nail the damn stuff \ndown, it seems to defy any attempts at definition. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I know, there was at least one person scrambling to make a copper \nbox, that&#39;s why I wanted more testing. I wish I could give some \ndifinitive answers, but there just doens&#39;t seem to be any.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Then, get a voice that seems to be Raudive, I would expect some \nsignifgiant difference with the copper box, I&#39;m not hearing any thing \nany better. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  BTW, the mp3s are in my folder. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Back to work after babyhow do you know when you&#39;re ready?\n&gt; http://lifestyle.msn.com/familyandparenting/articleNW.aspx?cp-\ndocumentid=5797498&ocid=T067MSN40A0701A\n&gt;"}
