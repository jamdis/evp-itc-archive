<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>HI,  I use to live in spanish oaks on harry wurzbach &amp; 410.
but am now up off O&#x27;Connor rd, IH35.
we were told there is a lot of history up here. but people talk all the
time,. so dont know.
suppose to be old farm land.   I have no idea if my neighbors have anything
go on, but this house does.
its just you cant count on it... it may be silent for 6 months  then active
4 , then quite another 3 months and then active for 10 months.
we never know.  it happens when it happens.
and usually when we least expect it.
we are usually watching a movie on tv, working on the computer, or trying to
sleep.
I think something just resides with us ..and goes about its business and
crosses paths with us... but, my family hears a woman call their name , and
I have heard a male voice call my name.  and my poor cats hear someone call
them and come running and then cant find them. I heard something call one of
my cats and I got chills all over because that spooked me. as it was
standing near me when it did that. the sound came from near me ..and I knew
it wasnt me. (I cant make that particular sound).
its been quiet for a couple months now... so no telling when it will start
up again.
I should have been paying more attention, to see when its most active.. but
I had not thought of that before.
