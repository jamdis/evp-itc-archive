I got my digital \ncamera and snapped a few pics after loading them onto the computer \nand adjusting the brightness and contrast to cut the sun glare this \nis what I found and have been capturing better and sharper images \nsince.\nI have experimented with crystal itc in the past with moderate \nresults that&#39;s when you shine a light through a quartz crystal and \ntake pics of the crystal the spirits actually use the natural energy \nof the crystal to form an image inside of the crystal.\nI believe that VPI is the same premise only it is projecting through \nthe crystal and onto the walls much like a movie projector sends \nlight through a film cell and in turn projects it onto a screen.\nI will try to re create this phenomenon in a controlled experiment \nusing a quartz crystal and a full spectrum light source.\n\nI have done many images this way, If you visit my website you can see \nsome examples of the images as well as a step by step example of the \nenhancement process.I wiil post a couple of pics here in my folder.\n\nmy website http://free-paranormalinvestigating.com/\n\nbruce"}
