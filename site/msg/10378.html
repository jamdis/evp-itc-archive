<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rees.  Rob&#x27;s MP3 file is in the &quot;RobE&quot; folder, in the files section.  I just looked.  It&#x27;s still 
there.

&gt; Hey Rob
&gt;   I can&#x27;t find your file, can you repost it so I can hear it.  You might need to convert it to 
mp3, because that will make it a smaller file.

&gt; 
&gt; Is this from a recorder? It sure sounds like a spirit to me.

&gt; &gt; Hi all, new to the group...I recorded this by accident on plane last 
&gt; &gt; year while waiting to take off, and trying to figure out an mp3 
&gt; player 
&gt; &gt; my son just bought me. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s real or not...I remember 
&gt; &gt; no one was talking around me at the time...could it have been some 
&gt; &gt; random fabric sound?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If it is real, how likely for someone on the other side to be on an 
&gt; &gt; air plane, and what kind of help would they need?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Rob
