<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Glad i somehow found this forum, was pointed here by some people who i 
believe know what they are talking about.  Anyhow i recently bought a 
germanium diode and also a tape recorder.  Is anyone familiar with how 
to setup the diode with my tape recorder to help &quot;enhance&quot; my chances 
of recieving a EVP recording?  I was hard to get these dang diodes, but 
now i dont know what to do with them.  I have a sodder gun and some 
wire, but no clue what to do with any of these parts yet.  Also I had 
some questions about the SpirtComm device and if anyone here is 
familiar with how to construct one (i would like to and already have 
the rough diagram available online).

Thanks
Ryan</pre>
