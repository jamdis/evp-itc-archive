&gt; Here is a blog steve sent me from moons myspace page as usual he&#x27;s 
in 
&gt; a panic because his fraudulent buisness is going down the tubes. he 
&gt; claims to know the only way box communication can be achieved but 
who 
&gt; would know better than the box inventor. Frank says it does not 
&gt; matter what means you use it&#x27;s the researcher that counts.
&gt; 
&gt; and if moon is so omnipitent in this research where are the 
&gt; documented recordings of his research, why are they not public for 
&gt; everyone to hear maybe because he&#x27;s full of bull. he said recently 
&gt; that no one but him gets legitimate communication, well I think 
it&#x27;s 
&gt; the other way around. 
&gt; 
&gt; chris if you read this, stop the cherade and have some dignity. 
&gt; become a real researcher and stop trying to down everyone else so 
you 
&gt; can continue to pray on the berieved and desperate people. And 
while 
&gt; I&#x27;m at it, if your so great why are you offering substantial 
&gt; discounts to your so called ghost hunter university. I&#x27;ll tell you 
&gt; why, because people are starting to realise you are nothing but a 
&gt; carnival side show palm raeder and have fooled people long enough. 
&gt; 
&gt; the reason I am addresing moon directly on this group is I know he 
is 
&gt; lurking in the shadows to see what is happening with real 
researchers 
&gt; and will know at least what I think of him.
&gt; I have done more legitimate box research in one week than he has 
done 
&gt; ever. My results are posted I challenge him to do the same.
&gt; 
&gt; here is a copy of his malicious blog from myspace.

&gt; 
&gt;   The Box has hit the fan! 
&gt; Current mood:  distressed 
&gt; Category: Dreams and the Supernatural 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; As so many of you know, I have been the primary tester of the 
&gt; Telephone to the Dead, a.k.a. &quot;Frank&#x27;s Box&quot; since 2004, and have 
had 
&gt; great success using it in paranormal research, and more currently, 
&gt; connecting the living with those on the other side. I have recently 
&gt; been made aware that there are several replica versions of this 
&gt; device being sold. I have also been told of another device that can 
&gt; be purchased for very little from any electronics merchant and 
&gt; altered by hand, producing what some consider to be results. As I 
&gt; expected, the samples that people have sent me are nothing more 
than 
&gt; timed radio scans that have no validity. 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; What is important to remember, before purchasing any of these 
replica 
&gt; devices, is that the Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides on the 
&gt; other side have repeatedly explained that the way that the 
Telephone 
&gt; to the Dead technology works, is by spirit energy manipulating the 
&gt; random voltage generator (RVG) and using white and pink noise, as 
&gt; well as radio fragment, to create real time voice answers to 
&gt; questions posed from our side. The most important aspect to this 
&gt; device is the medium operator who works as an antenna 
&gt; or &quot;interpreter&quot; for living individuals asking the questions. 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thomas Edison, in an intelligent spiritual discussion through the 
&gt; Telephone to the Dead, stated that there were only thirty of these 
&gt; individuals that could effectively use the device. Four have been 
&gt; identified to this point. 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have spent nearly four years testing and doing paranormal 
research 
&gt; with the Telephone to the Dead, and I have built strong 
relationships 
&gt; with Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides who I trust, and who 
trust 
&gt; me. These new &quot;radio scanners&quot; are not only a waste of money for 
&gt; people looking to do research with them in hopes of having 
effective 
&gt; communication with the other side, but may in fact be very 
dangerous. 
&gt; Should demonic and other negative entities learn to use these false 
&gt; devices, the results could be devastating. Though I rarely see eye 
to 
&gt; eye with the Catholic Church on the matter of using the Telephone 
to 
&gt; the Dead, I do admit that they predicted the widespread sale of 
false 
&gt; communication devices as far back as last year. I have recently 
begun 
&gt; to receive requests from individuals asking for help to close 
&gt; negative doorways and portals that they believe they opened using 
&gt; their purchased Telephone to the Dead replica. Others are claiming 
&gt; that I am a fraud because their purchased device doesn&#x27;t produce 
the 
&gt; positive results I have been fortunate enough to have, and claim 
that 
&gt; therefore, all of my results MUST be false. 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I can see this spiraling out of control already. Once again, I will 
&gt; continue my research with the actual Telephone to the Dead as well 
as 
&gt; provide public demonstrations and private readings for those truly 
&gt; interested in real time spirit communication. Please feel free to 
&gt; contact me with any questions at
