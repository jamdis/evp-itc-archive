Definitely investigate the hospital wing in Alcatraz -- in the  operating 
room, a friend of mine have gotten Class A EVPs:  My friend  sensed there was a 
doctor there; what she got was "Dr. Thomas here; I like to  travel; get ready". 
 I was in the hydrotherapy room and got "darkness is  power", which was an 
indirect reply to turning off the lights in order to  capture clearer EVPs.  My 
friend used a Panasonic RR-DR60 recorder; I  captured my EVP on a camcorder.  
Have a great time investigating  Alcatraz!  Sharon
