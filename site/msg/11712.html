I agree that I'm fascinated as well with all the instruments and the possible uses of even common tools and how they can apply to an investigation.  I get really thrilled about new technology designed specifically for the paranormal.  I think Digital Dowsing is coming out with a few more devices in the near future.  At least I hope so! :)

You know more than I do... I wish I was a technie 
geek.
I don't understand any of it, but as a paranormal 
investigator
I am fascinated by the instruments that come out, 
and
want to know everything.. ....

I 
don't think the Puck and Ovilus work together.  They are separate pieces 
with the same basic concepts, only different features.

I'm not sure of 
the exact mathematical calculations on what it does (have to look through older 
emails), but based off the result, it assigns it a word from a list.  As 
always, I assume there is a chance that it could leave words out as nothing is 
complete in the paranormal world.  Again, don't quote me, Bill Chappal, who 
I believe built it, would know much better than me.

One day I'll get 
enough money to buy one and try it out.  I'm a technie geek so I like to 
have the latest toys. :)

Thanks Bryan for replying
I was absolutely amazed when I saw that. 
Does the puck and the ovilus work together? 
This is very interesting. How do you think it works as far 
as
assigning a word according to the results from the 
sensors?
Could it leave words out? Example: What if something 
said
Demon ( that was in Paranormal State) and it was trying 
to
say Not Demon?

Hi Debbie,
   I think the Ovilus is similar to the Paranormal 
Puck.  What it does is take constant evironmental readings off the sensors 
inside it, does some math on them, then based off the result, assigns it to a 
word from a list of words it knows.  That word is then output through a 
speakjet microchip that you hear.
   I could be wrong though, but 
from my techie point of view...it's pretty darn cool. :)
All the 
best,
Bryan

I don't know how 
many of the members watch Paranormal State, but they used
a new piece of 
equipment called The Ovilus. You guys have got to check this
out. Go to www.digitaldowsing. com. I am not really sure who these guys 
are, and
where they came up 
with this. To me, it sounds kind of like Frank's Box, but
not the 
same.
Frank, please take a 
look at this, and tell us what  you think.
I don't understand 
how it works......
Deb
