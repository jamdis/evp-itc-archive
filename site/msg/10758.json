I&#39;m only 2 minutes into a 8 minute\n&gt; session, but i \n&gt; need to eat and sleep.  I posted what i got so far,\n&gt; i didn&#39;t want to \n&gt; let Rob down by getting it and not posting files\n&gt; from it the same day.  \n&gt; That&#39;s not my style, i appreciate him doing that for\n&gt; me and hope to get \n&gt; much more from it as i experiment.  Remember\n&gt; deadscience.com is where \n&gt; to go for more info on the speakjet boxes.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
