<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Audio experts? You can send a sample of EVP/ITC to Sony or Panasonic  
to have it analyzed unless you wanted to seek out someone locally.  
Myself, I like to stick to big companies. I love to have Sony tell me,  
yes, there&#x27;s a voice, it&#x27;s measurable, it exists, but how it got there  
is anyone&#x27;s guess. Tickles me pink!

What do you mean by the term &quot;lower entity&quot; and why would they not be  
intelligent or even brilliant (human terms)? Also, are you referring  
to my comments about the Fish Group?

&gt;
&gt; I fully agree with you on your last point. But this does not mean  
&gt; that are intelligent, does it? Is it possible that these phenomena  
&gt; we are discussing here is actually a lower entity?
