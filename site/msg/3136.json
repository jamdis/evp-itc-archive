I have been \nresearching the subject of Ghost Boxes for the last week or so and \ncame across this great group.  I need go nowhere else!\nSo much discussion on this very interesting topic.\nThe reason I was researching is, I will be talking about Ghost Boxes \n(Frank&#39;s Box, Joe&#39;s Box, Ron&#39;s Mini Box) on my BlogTalkRadio show on \nTuesday (tomorrow) at 7 PM Mountain Time. I live in Colorado Springs, \nnot too far from Frank Sumption I&#39;m guessing.\nIn case you want to listen to the show LIVE at 7 PM (PT) tomorrow, \nit&#39;s at: http://www.blogtalkradio.com/ufogeek\nYou can also listen after that when it&#39;s archived.  Last week&#39;s show \nhas received over 900 listeners so far.  I talked a bit about the \nSpiricom Mark IV last week.\nI have never used any Ghost Box, but I have experimented with my own \ndesign, and a friend and I are kicking around a small device, with \nmaybe only 3 IC chips or so.  Right now it&#39;s just on the drawing \nboard.\nAnyway... thanks for hearing me out.  Again, the url for the show is:\nhttp://www.blogtalkradio.com/ufogeek\n\n- Mike"}
