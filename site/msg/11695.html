<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It isn&#x27;t in any kind of special box or anything. It&#x27;s just connected
to either earphones, some little ipod type speakers or the digital
recorder. I&#x27;ve had it connected up to all those things.

&gt; How do you have the 469 set up?

&gt; YES. Actually, getting the flash as far away from the lens as possible
&gt; plus either bouncing it off the ceiling or using a diffuser will
&gt; almost eliminate dust orbs. A speedlite flash is well worth the $$.
&gt;
&gt; To make this a little more on topic, I have a 469 radio shack hack
&gt; unit. I&#x27;ve tried it a few times and haven&#x27;t received any messages at
&gt; all yet. I&#x27;ve even tried just letting it run for a while while I&#x27;m
&gt; doing other things and haven&#x27;t gotten anything. I guess there isn&#x27;t
&gt; anyone around who wants to talk to me :( Do you know of anything I can
&gt; do to try to drum up some conversation?
