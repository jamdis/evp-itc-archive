&gt; Thanks again for everyone who participated! I admire your courage and
&gt; motivation to try different methods, see what works, and try to improve
&gt; everyone&#x27;s understanding of EVP-ITC.
&gt;
&gt; If you recall, on 7/10/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer
&gt; monitor, right in front of me, and left it there until today, 7/14/2010,
&gt; noon Denver time. The experiment was for participants to determine what it
&gt; was. Vague or partial answers wouldn&#x27;t be counted (for example, just colors,
&gt; shapes, sizes, what it&#x27;s made of, etc): we&#x27;re looking for what it is.
&gt; Participants could use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or I suppose any
&gt; other means they chose.
&gt;
&gt; In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the start of
&gt; the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.
&gt; If you can follow the link, it is here:
&gt;
&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip
&gt;
&gt; The idea was that you could download the file at the beginning of the test,
&gt; and &#x27;keep it safe&#x27; on your computer. Then at the end of the test, I would
&gt; release the password so you could reveal the contents of the file. That way,
&gt; you were in control of the original image during the entire test, not me.
&gt;
&gt; The password for that file is: 123BlastOff
&gt; Instructions, if you need them, are also in that RJ folder.
&gt;
&gt; And if you did not care to download the zip file before the test, I will
&gt; post the final image there too.
&gt;
&gt; So to the results:
&gt;
&gt; Number of participants: 5
&gt; Total tries: 8
&gt; Ambiguous answers: 0
&gt; Correct answers: 0
&gt;
&gt; Object: A radio
&gt; Uzipped picture:
&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG
&gt;
&gt; So what do the results mean? All that we can really agree on from this
&gt; experiment is that no participant, with whatever theories or methods or
&gt; technology they used, was able to correctly determine the object. We can&#x27;t
&gt; say those theories or methods or technologies never work. Just as we can&#x27;t
&gt; say they do. Just that, for whatever reason, they did not work this time.
&gt; Readers can take the results, use them to improve or change their methods,
&gt; or keep doing what they&#x27;re doing.
&gt;
&gt; If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let me
&gt; know. I hope to get a new experiment up and running soon. Since there wasn&#x27;t
&gt; much participation Mon-Wed, I think the next experiment will be arranged to
&gt; mostly span the weekends.
&gt;
&gt; Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this first experiment.
