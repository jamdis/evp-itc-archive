Jen & I met her at the Atlanta  \n&gt; &gt; AA-EVP\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting a few years ago and she was surprised that attendees wanted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their photos taken with her and asked for her autograph. It&#39;s folks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like her and others in this field, including some of the  \n&gt; &gt; participants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of this forum, that keep the research moving forward.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We&#39;ll make sure Sarah is in our thoughts during this holiday  \n&gt; &gt; season. -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bill\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As most of us know, Sarah Estep, was the founder of the AA-EVP-- \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; route by I, and many of us, first got to the place we&#39;re at today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve heard from a friend of mine who is also of that generation of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EVP tapers, that Sarah&#39;s condition is deteriorating. I&#39;d like  \n&gt; &gt; to ask\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all of you to send positive thoughts her way, as she was always a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very gracious lady who was more than helpful to many, many people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were interested in taping. I bought my first equipment from  \n&gt; &gt; Sarah&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; husband and benefited greatly from her wisdom, always given  \n&gt; &gt; freely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She will be remembered as giant in this field.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please think of her kindly this Christmas Eve.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
