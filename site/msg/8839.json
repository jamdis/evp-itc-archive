I find that some of this is very similar to traditional EVP, where more than one \nthing can be heard fairly well in the same example.  It can really make things confusing!  \n\nI often wonder why they can&#39;t be more clear, more often, but then I have to laugh when I \nthink about all the song lyrics that get slaughtered by people singing along with the tune \nand then just guessing at what the less clear parts say.  LOL.  :0)\n\nCheck out this fun site I ran across (Kiss This Guy:  The Archive of Misheard Lyrics):\n\nhttp://www.kissthisguy.com/\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristin Morris&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Margaret you really have an ear for this method!

On the &quot;evil eye&quot; on I also\n&gt; hear it as, &quot;You \n&gt; forget to be polite.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully amongst us, we can come up with a little better explanation of\n&gt; &#39;air.&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups &lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; .com,\n&gt; &quot;Kristin&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I just posted three MP3 files in my folder (Kristin&#39;s Folder)from a\n&gt; &gt; session I did today using EVP Maker and the Allophones.
