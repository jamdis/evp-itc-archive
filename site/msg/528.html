LOL
   
  I dont know about everyone else but I joined to learn and study about evp, and hopefully work towards a goal of better communication. I think Frank just realized he needed to take a step back from the fighting. They ALLLLL know it went to far and that by sending replys to bad emails it didnt accomplish anything but make each side angrier. 
   
  Delete button my friends...its an awesome thing I tell ya!!! It takes two people for an email fight so just dont be one of the two.
   
  We have a better purpose than this drama. Better things to do with our time. For those who have nothing better to do with your time, I can email you a list of ideas, some even have to do with doing EVP or video ITC.
   
  As for evp, any member can post them but with all the crap flying who wanted to get involved??? They dont want to choose a side in a fight that had nothing to do with them. Frank may have felt the need to unjoin from this group but he is ALWAYS welcome to rejoin in the future. Everyone is. 
   
  Maybe he felt if he unjoined it would take the pressure off other members here and make them more comfortable to post about ITC without having to get blasted for being a part of "his" group. He never wanted it to be "his" thats why he immediately made other owners.  It's not my group or your group it is "everyones" group. 
   
  Every member here is equal. I may not agree with you all off the time but I am not here to agree or disagree with you. I am here to share ideas in a free forum alongside other researchers or people generally interested in educating themselves.
   
   I'm telling you all, stop the BS, end the drama, find something better to do than talk behind each others backs or spar in nasty emails. And when your good and happy, do an evp session and send me some clips =)
   
  Anger makes for bad evp sessions. So do bad vibes. 
   
  Be your own point of light rather than a dark void.

            Well,
  doesnt really make much sense that the owner of the group leaves, i dont know how other people feel about this but there wont be much of a group left then. Franks the one that keeps the messages going, giving evp's etc. Other than a few misc postings its all Frank. It will be interesting to see how this all plays out. Thanks to everyone for the damage youve caused. You have accomplished exactly what you set out to do. Be mean, evil and trifiling. You get what you give, and ten fold at that. EVP should teach you at the least, that you still lead the same miserable life after you die! HOW SAD!
   
  Frank, plz forward this to that email i sent you, i dont have that address.
  Hopefully, youll just send me an email today telling me you want back on the list!
