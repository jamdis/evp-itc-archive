What it is, no more and no less!

I am a Skeptic, it the tr=

whole theory, but I have never questioned your heart or=C2=A0integrity over=
 it.=C2=A0 (Well, other than letting Moon play the dance he is playing with=

But, lets analytically look at this for what it is and find=C2=

 top of some mountain, so be it!=C2=A0 But other people are not going to se=
