No problem I took care of her Frank. Your password should be whatever you use to sign into group I set up your new email with all the mod stuff (I think I did anyway)
   
  >>Thanks, yeah it might be interesting. Chris and I get alot of direct 
responses when he brings a box over for tweaking, but usually when wrecording. I guess Chris and I will be going into business to produce the 
boxes, and he hates it when I give them away, like I have been doing so far. 
I have no concept of money or or value.

Frank>>>

   
  I agree with Chris you should be compensated for your hard work and time put into these inventions. And I think if you had the proper funding you could apply the prototype to more of a mass market rather than build each one yourself for everybody to use. 
   
  Think about it, just because you know how to build a car doesnt mean you need to build everyones car for them. You have been so generous in giving out directions and help but truth is people just dont follow your directions thus far. So if you want to meet the need and help others who are not so technical or into building then perhaps once you get a few out the door and get some cash flow you may want to look into having it manufactured.
   
  I know you feel strange about making any profit off it but Chris and I both feel strange that you are not making any profit at all. If ya wanna donate the money ya make into something you could try getting those more expensive parts that you had wanted to try out but couldnt afford or making upgrades to one of your prototypes. The truth is it costs you to make them and that you should be compensated for your time and the $$ you put into construction.
