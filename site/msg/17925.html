Stories about things in the past are not testable predictions, and continue=
 to suggest this is all just radio snippets that people claim are spirits, =
but have nothing to justify that claim.=C2=A0 

Like I said, post a predict=
ion for everyone to hear, before it happens, with specific dates and detail=
s.=C2=A0 If it happens, I would expect to be more interested that this is n=
ot just random radio. But, when it doesn't happen, it makes me wonder why p=
eople still claim it's spirits, but they must be lying. :-)

If you have a post with a prediction we can all con=
