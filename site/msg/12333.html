<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Note to all members,

When uploading files please upload small files and make sure you are 
using MP3 format and not larger file compression such as WAV. This 
group has limited space and all files are subject to deletion to make 
room. For those who would like to post larger files or multiple files 
you can make use of esnips.com for file sharing. Once uploaded you can 
simply post the link to your files just as it does when you upload 
here. Esnips is free and they give you 50 gb of space and allow 
multiple file formats as well as larger files. The yahoo group only 
allows 100 mb for the ENTIRE group to share so posting rules had to be 
implemented.
