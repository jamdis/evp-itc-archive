&gt;
&gt; Years ago, when I was taping on a reel to reel, mostly, I often got
&gt; voices that sounded maddeningly not like me, but like people I knew
&gt; who were not dead. They never identified themselves as those people,
&gt; but the voices were dead ringers (ar ar ar). I am also, apparently,
&gt; able to randomly project my voice into the minds of people I know. It
&gt; begins to happen to almost everyone that I bond strongly with. I
&gt; can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have heard someone I know spin around
&gt; and say, &quot;What?&quot; They always say they hear my voice, but don&#x27;t
&gt; understand what I am saying. This is always accompanied, on my end,
&gt; by a sort of ringing sound in my head. I cannot control it at all.
&gt; I&#x27;m just throwing this out there as food for thought that may pertain
&gt; to your discussion.....

&gt; &gt; Very true, Frank! The ghosts who are producing the EVP&#x27;s certainly
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; have brains. :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have no doubt that there may be a few people around who could
&gt; &gt; create EVP
&gt; &gt; phenomena in an electrronic device, but it would be an extremely  
&gt; small
&gt; &gt; number. I think most of the EVP we get are from disembodied  
&gt; beings who
&gt; &gt; have figured out how to do it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#x27;s not brain! We are all spirit, of course we can create our
&gt; &gt; own EVPs. You don&#x27;t suddenly become spirit when you die, you just
&gt; &gt; wake up. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t ask questions, I don&#x27;t want to create
&gt; &gt; the answers I&#x27;m looking for.
