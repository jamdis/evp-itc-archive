AM *loves* to shoot straight up because of the bounce (as\nyou HAM guys know) but TV and FM wants as much power as possible to be\nat the top for the farthest line of sight broadcast.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was amazed to read that you guys got FM chatter on the recorder. \nI guess it is possible in theory but I would never had expected that.\n Just goes to show why it is all radio theory and not radio proof or\nlaw :))  Those EM fields are tricky little buggers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Don\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Mon, 12/15/08, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Of Radio Interference and equipment...\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Monday, December 15, 2008, 9:09 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s only true of a simple dipole. Antennas can be engineered to get \n&gt; practically any pattern you want. In fact, many FM and TV antennas\nhave a \n&gt; pattern which peaks from directly below the antenna to the horizon and \n&gt; sends very little signal straight up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, close-in you might still be in the Fresnel zone of the field.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, 15 Dec 2008, don powell wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just an engineering point.  Radio radiates out kind of like a\ndonut turned on it&#39;s side.  So directly under, up to a dozen or so\nfeet from a tower has zero transmission.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It kind of looks like this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   |\n&gt; &gt;  (|)\n&gt; &gt; ------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Where the parenthesis are the radio waves.  Except they do not\nreally get that close to the tower base.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The point of the strongest signal is a little past the height of\nthe tower.  So if the tower is 100&#39; then if you move away from the\ntower to about 110&#39; or so that is the most powerful signal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Don\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; . I also tried the local police and some microwave towers,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; right under the towers, and heard nothing from those sources. But they\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; are on much higher frequencies than AM or FM radio and are not\nknown to\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; get into any electronics around here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Zack\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _,___\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
