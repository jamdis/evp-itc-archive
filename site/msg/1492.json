These are just \nfrom the first couple minutes, I changed frequency when an all country music \nstation came in, and stayed. I moved up to around 1000khz, but didn&#39;t have \ntime last night to go though that section. There was some wind that come \nthrough, probably a week or more ago that broke my wire dipole on the roof.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nhttp://imagine-windowslive.com/hotmail/?locale=en-us&ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_mini_2G_0507\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_29a6_6e63_11fc\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;KieraThatStormBreakUpThatAntenna(the-roof-dipole).mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;KieraThatStormBreakUpThatAntenna(the-roof-dipole).mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_29a6_6e63_11fc\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;--something--StoppedTheGroup---Kiera-WeBalancedOurAntennas.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n filename=&quot;--something--StoppedTheGroup---Kiera-WeBalancedOurAntennas.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_29a6_6e63_11fc\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;There&#39;sLotsOfPeopleHere-GuideToYourPlanet----.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;There&#39;sLotsOfPeopleHere-GuideToYourPlanet----.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_29a6_6e63_11fc--"}
