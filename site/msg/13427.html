I chatted with the Mother of this household on Wednesday evening.  They
hav=
e had no reoccurrence of any of the entities, and the family was
preparing =
to leave this house not being able to continue to live there. 
She is thril=
led with the results.  In the end I guess that is what
really matters.  I a=
m sorry you didn't get to go and try to do a
proper investigation.


You ha=
ve carefully avoided saying what you would have done differently
and why.  =
You are blowing your own chance to share your knowledge with
the rest of th=
is group.  Please enlighten us.



Regards,

Jon in Texas
