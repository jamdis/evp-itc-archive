<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Oh yes--it does. It&#x27;s the same theory I share, but I was wondering  
what Mike and Lisa&#x27;s answer would be. :)

&gt; Ann,
&gt;
&gt; I have come to the conclusion it is that when I receive a response
&gt; like &quot;wait&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;ll ask&quot; or &quot;not yet&quot; in response to asking for
&gt; contact with
&gt; another spirit other than a tech. The spirit that is asked for comes
&gt; through
&gt; in one of two ways depending on what spiritual plane that individual
&gt; spirit resides on.
&gt;
&gt; I have been able to discern from communications with mike and Lisa
&gt; that there exists
&gt; more than one spiritual plane, the first is where our spirit awakens
&gt; after making the
&gt; transition from the physical. this is supposedly the only plane that
&gt; communication with
&gt; the physical world is capable of being sent from.
&gt;
&gt; When a spirit moves from this first plane to the next changes in the
&gt; enlightenment of the spirit take place.
&gt; The details pertaining to that are to complex to receive with our
&gt; rudimentary equipment, evidently it can not be
&gt; explained in short phrases or sentences. which is completely logical.
&gt;
&gt; To get back to the question, when a researcher asks for a spirit to
&gt; be brought forward so they can communicate.
&gt; The tech must locate that spirit energy and summon it to the place
&gt; where the communication is facilitated.
&gt; If the spirit has moved on to a higher plane of existence it must
&gt; travel back to this lower plane to communicate.
&gt;
&gt; Apparently spirits that have moved up can return to the lower
&gt; spiritual planes but spirits that have not yet
&gt; ascended to a higher plane can not advance.
&gt;
&gt; I am assuming that when a spirit is called by a tech to communicate
&gt; with the physical if it is possible it will
&gt; journey to the communication point. If it is not possible for the
&gt; spirit to come to that point for whatever reason
&gt; I expect that they try to form a communication link from one point to
&gt; another, and the tech must act as a telephone operator if you will.
&gt;
&gt; that is the best way I understand how to explain it, I hope it
&gt; answers your question Ann.

Oh yes--i does.
