Frank,
 
I do daily research with box #12 and never use random mode, I have=
 never gotten a clear
message from random. I find through trial and error t=
hat the AM linear mode serves as the 
best mode for real time and recorded =
communication. I have also been testing the RS box 
frequently and it seems=
 that the AM band works best. I have confermed this with my guides and they=
 agree AM linear
serves the best.

To ALL members of this group,
I agree wit=
h Steve. Ive told you all this many times yet some of you like to get caugh=
t up in the heat of the moment.
 
It is very disturbing to watch you all tr=
y to win this war of words. There is no winner just a bunch of losers. And =
while you are busy losing theres no GOOD research being performed by YOU.
 =

How much research did YOU do today? How much time did you spend firing off=
 replies to attempt to respond to someone you dont even know about somethin=
g that doesnt even involve YOU? How much time did you spend replying to joi=
n in the arguments you feel do involve YOU?
 
The point being, this is a re=
search group for ITC not a boxing room and definitely your own personal bat=
tlegrounds. Take that elsewhere. Healthy discussion is one thing but I have=
 seen very few people offering that. In fact I know a few of you joined her=
e just to go after someone who ticked you off. Then there are those who jus=
t seem to be firing in all directions, taget doesnt matter.
 
Get a grip pe=
ople!! Ive seen 4 year olds with more self control. If you arent interested=
 in researching ITC for yourself then what the heck are YOU doing HERE. 
 
=
ONCE AGAIN THIS IS AN ITC RESEARCH GROUP!! 
 
As for the box Frank is and a=
lways has been the first/primary tester of any box he has built. 
 
lol
Mis=
ty
 
P.S. I think you all are capable of finding better things to do, if no=
t let me know and I will give you a few ideas =3D)
