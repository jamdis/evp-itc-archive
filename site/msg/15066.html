Yes that is possible, since sound moves air, and air moves flames (that's h=
ow you blow out birthday candles).=A0 Still, nothing to do with EM (other t=
han the light and heat given off by the candle).

=A0
A =
mistake that a lot of people make is thinking that there are two different =
types of energy at work when it comes to sound waves and electromagnetic wa=
ves. The only thing that seperates them is frequency and power. Radio waves=
 are radio waves because they occupy a certain block of the electromagnieti=
c spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same spectrum just farther down with =
much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can penetrate almost anyth=
ing because of their wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength the more ways =
we can shield against them.
=A0
Think of microwaves. These are also a type =
of radio and telemetry transmitting wave but the waves also have a physical=
 effect on our environment by causing molecules to speed up, which creates =
heat. A little lower than this is IR or infrared it too can cause physical =
objects to heat up but usually it just causes molecules to rotate in place.=
 All physical things give off IR light. Its a way the total system conserve=
s energy by spontaneously emitting IR radiation.

Here is some food for thought. I am currentl=

=A0
It was me and ano=
ther girl teammate=A0present in the room. I picked up a 3rd female voice on=
 my digital voice recorder that I carry with me. We were standing right nex=
t to another digital video recorder that I leave beside my night vision cam=
era. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd voice. I have asked the girl th=
at was with me to check her recording to see if she picked it up.
=A0
I hav=
e long felt the true EVP does not come from sound waves in the environment,=
 or then it wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are app=
earing directly on the recordings.
=A0
This instance with the recorders may=
 back that theory up. That other recorder should have picked that voice up =
if it were sound waves in the environment.
=A0
I am attaching the clip of t=
his 3rd voice. The=A0file that is named=A0"01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip.=
=A0You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", and then another comes in right =
after that. I think I know what it says.
=A0
Again, I was live monitoring m=

I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave an=
d demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It works off the hete=
rodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another i=
n frequency then if you add or subtract them together you get a beat freque=
ncy or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at =
54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequen=
cy at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference=A0frequency at 9KH=
z, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an exampl=
e, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turnin=
g them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were generated within a =
few inches of the recorder.
=A0
We are able to reproduce this affect in not=
 only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio =
as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio spotli=
ght" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
