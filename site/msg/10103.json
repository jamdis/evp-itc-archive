If you aren&#39;t sure about that, make a\nbackup copy of your files and compare them later to the original files.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n\n&gt; I can&#39;t explain that either, sometimes i click on a file from a month \n&gt; ago and it say&#39;s something completely different than what i posted.  \n&gt; Either they are changing how the files sound or we hear differently \n&gt; on certain days.  Now let&#39;s factor in everyone else that hears \n&gt; different than we do, i don&#39;t think we will all agree on one file \n&gt; saying the same thing.  I do hear things with my headphones that i do \n&gt; not hear on my regular pc speakers.\n\n&gt; -Steve"}
