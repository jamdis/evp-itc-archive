Amazing I take a weeks vacation and come back to 350 notes, and see this one.
   
  Both of your arguments are indeed accurate. 
   
  But it is an added bonus to the recipient or customer to hear their loved one's voice on tape rather that by word of mouth from a gifted clairaudient, clairvoyant, psychic person. That is the icing on the cake.
   
  What would bother me terribly is if any of us researchers received a message from a spirit in which we could actually make contact with their loved one to send the tape, and then to try and charge the contactee for the recording.  
   
  In my opinion if any of us receive such a message with that clarity, we should send/give it to the contactee free of charge as doing so is in a sense a spiritual gift from the spirit to the contactee, and we are just the messenger.  I have been researching this concept, and I myself hope to one day be able to receive clear and concise messages which would enable me to contact the spirit's loved one to give them that message should they wish to receive it. And I gurantee you it will be free of charge. 
   
  Have any of you received on any occasion enough info from the spirits to be able to contact the loved one and give them the recording?

Jeremy,

There will always be a market for less educated people and some to 
take advantage of that. There is a a saying out there---- "Stupid 
people don't know they're stupid". How true is that.

there are those who take advantage and should have no business in

to do box sessions. I can't remember the exact fee, but it's 
outrageous that he's doing this, not to mention, he does so with a 
Frank's box. He is a self proclaimed medium and I've heard from many 
sources that he is nothing but a fake.

don't agree that she should use her abilities for gain, but it 
doesn't mean I like her any less. My not liking it won't change the 
fact that it happens, it's just the way things go.

Ron says he uses the best parts available and that the cost of the 
Minibox is very close to what it costs to manufacture it. How close, 
I have no idea. On the other hand, I don't own one as I think $399 
or $449 for the "crystal enhanced version," is a lot to pay for a 
device that, from what I've heard, produces the same results as a 
Radio Shack radio for $25-$40.

<div>Amazing I take a weeks vacation and come back to 350 notes, and see this one.</div>  <div> </div>  <div>Both of your arguments are indeed accurate. </div>  <div> </div>  <div>But it is an added bonus to the recipient or customer to hear their loved one's voice on tape rather that by word of mouth from a gifted clairaudient, clairvoyant, psychic person. That is the icing on the cake.</div>  <div> </div>  <div>What would bother me terribly is if any of us researchers received a message from a spirit in which we could actually make contact with their loved one to send the tape, and then to try and charge the contactee for the recording.  </div>  <div> </div>  <div>In my opinion if any of us receive such a message with that clarity, we should send/give it to the contactee free of charge as doing so is in a sense a spiritual gift from the spirit to the contactee, and we are just the messenger.  I have been researching this concept, and I
 myself hope to one day be able to receive clear and concise messages which would enable me to contact the spirit's loved one to give them that message should they wish to receive it. And I gurantee you it will be free of charge. </div>  <div> </div>  <div>Have any of you received on any occasion enough info from the spirits to be able to contact the loved one and give them the recording?</div>  <div> </div>  <div> </div>  <div><BR><BR><B><I>Early Cuyler <ecuyler@...></I></B> wrote:</div>  <BLOCKQUOTE class=replbq style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid">  <DIV id=ygrp-text>  <div>  <DIV style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: times

 you've said. I'm just saying <BR>there are those who take advantage and should have no business in <BR>doing so. One example I can give is Chris Moon. He charges people <BR>to do box sessions. I can't remember the exact fee, but it's <BR>outrageous that he's doing this, not to mention, he does so with a <BR>Frank's box.

No I don't. <BR>Ron says he uses the best parts available and that the cost of the <BR>Minibox is very close to what it costs to manufacture it. How close, <BR>I have no idea. On the other hand, I don't own one as I think $399 <BR>or $449 for the "crystal enhanced version," is a lot to pay for a <BR>device that, from what I've heard, produces the same results as a <BR>Radio Shack radio for $25-$40. <BR>> <BR>> Jeremy<BR>> <BR>> ----- Original Message ----<BR>> From: itcdeadpeople <ITCdeadpeople@ ...><BR>> To: <A href="mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com" target=_blank rel=nofollow ymailto="mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com">EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com</A><BR>> Sent: Saturday, April 5, 2008 1:32:28 PM<BR>> Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: boxes on ebay<BR>>
 <BR>> Hi Jeremy. If everyone knew about these support <BR>boards and that other resources are <BR>> available to them, that would be one thing. Obviously everyone <BR>here is aware of that. But <BR>> not everyone knows this place exists. <BR>> <BR>> And even if they do know about the boards here, how many would have <BR>the nerve to ask <BR>> for help from strangers? As Bruce recently shared, he gives people <BR>invitations to contact <BR>> him privately in case they are too shy just ask a question <BR>publicly. Which means, by the <BR>> way, to some degree they have overcome some of that shyness in <BR>order to post whatever it <BR>> was to begin with, which inspired him to make this offer. What if <BR>they don't even have the <BR>> gumption to be anything more than be a look-i-loo?<BR>> <BR>> I'm guessing many people are just surfing the net, checking out <BR>paranormal stuff, and run <BR>> across the hacked boxes for sale. <BR>>
 <BR>> Again, I ask people who are taking the position you and Bruce are <BR>regarding profits ... do <BR>> you have this same harsh sentiment toward Ron Ricketts, who makes <BR>and sells the <BR>> MiniBoxes? I realize he is passionate about this research and <BR>helping others. Does that <BR>> give him amnesty for making a profit? <BR>> <BR>> Personally I think we need to not be so judgmental. At what point <BR>does "profitable gain in <BR>> the paranormal field" become "sickening?" I have a friend who is a <BR>medium. I mean THE <BR>> REAL DEAL. He charges for his services. The fee is reasonable <BR>compared to many in his <BR>> field. Does he do this because he's a terrible person looking to <BR>take advantage of people? <BR>> NO, he does so because he has been given a gift that changes <BR>people's lives for the better. <BR>> But he has to make a living.... has to support himself in some way. <BR>And because he has <BR>> chosen to
 provide this service full time (and is not a trust fund <BR>baby), he makes a profit. <BR>> This allows him to help far more people than he could if working <BR>some other kind of job <BR>> and providing his services at no cost on the side. <BR>> <BR>> I realize this is not exactly the same thing as gouging people on <BR>the price for a <BR>> commercially available product, but making such blanket statements <BR>about profitability in <BR>> the paranormal field being sickening is rather short-sighted, in my <BR>opinion. <BR>> <BR>> I have a southern friend who likes to say, "It's a mighty thin <BR>plank that ain't got two sides." <BR>> I just don't think we have the right to claim that simply because <BR>someone is offering a <BR>> good and or service for profit to consumers in the paranormal <BR>market, that this <BR>> automatically means they are taking advantage of other's <BR>vulnerabilities. <BR>> <BR>> For Pete's sake, no one is
 twisting the people's arms to buy those <BR>units on eBay. They are <BR>> perfectly free to buy from whatever source they choose. Since the <BR>units do work as <BR>> claimed, we can argue that people have overpaid, shopped unwisely, <BR>or whatever. I assure <BR>> you this happens every single day throughout the retail market <BR>place with all types of <BR>> products and services. <BR>> <BR>> I will say I have a fairly heathy dose of distain for <BR>charlatans/scam artists (of any flavor in <BR>> any field) but that is not what we are talking about here. We are <BR>talking about people who <BR>> are offering legitimate products to consumers. I'd rather see <BR>people doing this for profit, <BR>> even when obscene, than running scams that damage people's <BR>physical, mental, and/or <BR>> financial well-being. <BR>> <BR>> Margaret<BR>> <BR>> --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Early Cuyler <ecuyler@ > wrote:<BR>>
