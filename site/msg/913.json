My systems are not designed for that ....stuff, and I can&#39;t\n&gt; support those activities, even it means that I don&#39;t personaly put  \n&gt; any more\n&gt; of my boxes out there in the public. The information for making  \n&gt; this stuff\n&gt; is out there, and others can build this stuff, and do whatever they  \n&gt; want\n&gt; with it. I doubt if there will be many &quot;Frank&#39;s Box&quot; clones out  \n&gt; there, while\n&gt; the circuits are straight forward, it takes the &quot;certain  \n&gt; understanding&quot; to\n&gt; get it to work.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Exercise your brain!
