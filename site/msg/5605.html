Subject: [EVP-ITC] Wondering if anyone ever asked?

    I was thinking tonight as Frank S. welcomed some of our new comers to 
the group if in fact anyone during a box session inquired to the names 
in which the other side call us?

For instance Frank has been addressed as princess, and I know I have 
gotten a spirit stating he was my brother (I am an only child). I am 
curious as to whether or not this could in fact be affilated with a 
past or former life. That at one time Frank S. could have been of 
royality and I could in fact have had siblings.

How far fetched is it that we could be actually talking to spirits we 
once had a relationship with or if that is even possible.

I would welcome any imput on my wild and crazy thoughts!

Thanks!
Juli
