You are correct I have a rs 12-469 and I cut the pin so it scans continually when needed.   I at times used audacity on my computer to record, thinking that speed control would be useful to interpret messages...nice thought.   I like the simplicity of your suggestion to just plug the radio directly into the digital recorder.  Not knowing exactly how all this goes down, I thought the radio scan sounds need to mix in the room so that the techs on the other side can respond.  Whatever works.  \n   \n  The other main question I have is regarding the radio stations I can pick up here in my part of Mexico, on the Yucatan.  I only get several stations during a complete scan of all a.m. or f.m. channels...don&#39; t know if that is enough.  It has been suggested that I somehow can add an antenna to search for more channels, which I would attempt if it is really necessary.  I get mostly Spanish language stations and an occasional station from Texas that skips across the Gulf of Mexico.  Not much to scan.  Any thoughts on this?\n   \n  By the way, I think the work you are doing is, well, extraordinary.    Like pros from any other field of endeavor, you make this stuff look easy to do...not so.  Thanks again.

Nada, nothing, zilch.  Maybe because I only get to scan past 5 to 8 channels on Am or FM so I don&#39;t have enough signals to muster a response.  But from what you and others with experience seem to be saying, it shouldn&#39;t matter because I will get help from someone on the other-side.  Maybe they can&#39;t find me in Mexico?  Please let your techs know I am here...should be no problem with immigration papers or money exchange.  I really need help.
