<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

Sorry I missed it.  Would like to learn more about why the probe works.  These two seem to be either making headway (and applying it to ie disabled kids experimentally so they can hear and understand better) or possibly a combo of real and hoax.  I get leery when money is involved but understand the need for funding further research and equipment, creating time to do it, and expenses involved in putting together events to share ideas and new technology (and pay for it). It&#x27;s a fine line and you really need to be on the inside to know for sure but I think Andy and Michelle are genuine, as well as April Slaughter. Just my opinion. 

My favorite project with Andy and Michelle is the one involving trying to help the seal that lost one flipper.   

Do you know if there area any archives?

Thanks for sharing that.

Adrienne

&gt; I&#x27;ve just finished two days at the American Ghost Society conference where I was blown away by a presentation by April Slaughter on Andy Coppock&#x27;s ITC Probe.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you guys know about this?
&gt; 
&gt; She played a good portion of an eleven minute interactive, full sentence conversation that she had with her grandfather who died seven years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Unless this is a hoax, which I would hope that an MIT graduate and biomedical engineer wouldn&#x27;t be part of, this is extraordinary.
&gt; 
&gt; We heard full sentences in the same voice throughout. The words were understandable with intonation coming through.
&gt; 
&gt; I was utterly blown away.  
&gt; 
&gt; Coppock is doing a controlled study with it, using other scientists and a few ghost hunters.
