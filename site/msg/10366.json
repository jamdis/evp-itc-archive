The guy gets his name dropped \nmore than anyone I know, doesn&#39;t he?  He must have a good agent on \nthe other side!  :)\n\nThis guy sent me a message saying that all the boxes are fake.  He \nseems like a sane fellow.  Probably on the board here somewhere. \n\nHere is his video about Frank&#39;s Box:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isVDrVWyHlU\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Misty&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I thought I would reply here.
