Perhaps it is like my mother, she refuses to communicate using certain methods but some of my friends will try anything LOL
   
  They find it confusing sometimes thats why we hear the guides instruct them how they can communicate.
   
  Maybe you just need a different method for some spirits I dont know, but thats what I do. I bounce back and forth so I keep in contact with my regular group while I experiment with something new. That way I carry more of them over into the new session. Each time I try something new I get hooked up with a different group set, and sometimes you can even hear when the old group joins in the new group session and they talk to each other.
