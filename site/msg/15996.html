<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think you are much too generous with these entities.  If you had a real live person in your life who was causing you this much grief, you&#x27;d certainly give him the boot, wouldn&#x27;t you?  It&#x27;s one thing to welcome all comers, but another to suffer from doing so -- and from hearing the messages you get, I can&#x27;t see how it wouldn&#x27;t have a negative effect on you.  I&#x27;d tell them to go toward the light; you might be doing them a favor.  (Again, just my opinion, so feel free to tell me to take a flying leap!)

&gt;  I always welcome everything. It&#x27;s not always the same voices, and it doesn&#x27;t matter waht I&#x27;m using. But--I did do an EVP session last night and they said it was an unethical spirit doing that-then they talked about end of cycles stuff-so what&#x27;s the difference?

&gt; &gt; Frank, have you tried asking this entity who tells you this doomsday stuff to go toward the light?  Or otherwise leave you alone?  I&#x27;m wondering if he/she/it is hogging the spotlight and not letting anyone else through.  That time I was getting bullshit answers from &quot;Steve,&quot; and my Uncle Red came through, I swear I heard someone say, &quot;Get away from me&quot; -- as if Red was trying to talk, and Steve was getting in the way somehow.  Just a thought:  maybe your guys are keeping more desirable contact with benevolent entities at bay.  (Like I know anything, I&#x27;m a newbie! Feel free to ignore my posts!  But I just feel so bad for you, that you keep getting all this doomsday stuff.)

&gt; &gt; &gt;  Went on one of the ghost hunts on the Queen may, but I don&#x27;t get anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; related to tat stuff, I get this stuff--everywhere.  I have my doubts about
&gt; &gt; &gt; it beng true, maybe just fear junk from some level. I was using the 12-470
&gt; &gt; &gt; hackie shack, and wouyld get littel burst of FM when I went by a window or
&gt; &gt; &gt; outside door.
