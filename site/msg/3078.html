Juli,
 
To answer your first question, I believe the file you are referring=
 to came from a Frank's box session.
My area does not receive the best radi=
o signal which as you know drives both Frank's and Joe's boxes.
The clarity=
 of the messages you receive depend on a number of factors, of course quali=
ty of radio reception,
the strength and duration of a single signal fragmen=
t or series of signal fragments while the message is being formed
and also =
the knowledge and ability of the sending spirit to manipulate the signal to=
 form the messages. 
It's like talking on a cell phone if the conditions ar=
e right you have a clear loud conversation if conditions are poor 
you expe=
rience all types of interference and the call is broken up and even cut off=
.
 
question 2, 
 
I have never done research personally in the field with =
either box but have gotten what I refer to as 
traditional evp messages on =
a recording in addition to the box messages. These extra messages do not 
c=
ome over the box in real time and are only discovered after reviewing the r=
esulting recording. 
the traditional evp is imposed onto the recording medi=
um during a box session.
 
question 3
 
I have never gotten into a heated d=
ebate as far as back and forth arguing, but Steve and I have experienced se=
vere 
negativity and even physical manipulation of energy where both our Jo=
e's boxes had their circuit boards fried only
two days apart. and prior to =
that we were being deceived by negative entities posing as guide spirits an=
d technicians
giving us false information and misleading messages to manipu=
late our actions concerning the boxes and their research.
Our boxes got fri=
ed only after we surmised what was actually happening and the negative spir=
its knew they could no longer 
control what we where trying to accomplish. =
now before any attempt at box communication I do a protection prayer and 
a=
sk my guide spirits to block any and all negative energy or entities from c=
oming through and so far it seems to be working
other than the occasional c=
urse or rude comment everything has been peaceful, but you must stay aware =
of this at all times.

t, 17 Nov 2007 00:06:04 +0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Changing the subject on the=
 debate of the boxes!




I have several questions for those who currently =
have devices. I am hoping you can answer.When listening to some of the mess=
ages you currently have posted like the message regarding Tesla, why is it =
that some come thru so very clear and audiable to understand vs. others? Mo=
st of mine audio I have gotten from the boxes are very clear to hear outrig=
ht.Second question? In those who have tested it at a proposed location, hav=
e they ever gotten addition evp relating to the messages coming over the bo=
x? The reason I asked is because I have. When video taping the box being us=
ed, I got a warning of sorts prior to the message from the box. Has anyone =
else experienced this?Third, has anyone ever gotten into a heated debate wi=
th someone over the box. A two way conversation that had the potential of g=
etting nasty? Or things that came across that were not nice?I would love to=
 know if anyone has experienced any of this events.Thanks!Juli
