Lately, I haven't been recording due to school but before I put it down I w=
as using a combination system.

Normally, I would use just clear dead ai=
r...ambient room noise and record. I get pretty good clarity and the same v=
oices I have gotten for a few years now. A while ago (maybe a few weeks) I =
posted my last setup. I was using a spiricom type setup but instead of tran=
smitting just the 13 tones of spiricom, I was transmitting that mixed with =
the 72 allophones and running it through Stefan's evpmaker. This is what I =
used as my signal generator and transmitted via radio and receiver via anot=
her radio within 3 meters. The signal was decent and I did get speech but d=
idn't get to mess with it again.

Normally, I keep a low profile. Mostly because I am fi=

ntertain myself. LOL Misty and I have been recording together for years and=
 we opt for different methods than most. Since "box mania" hit, most people=

Anyway, that is=
