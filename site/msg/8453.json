And that once a portal was opened and closed that entity re-opened the portal?  Has this researcher done another session to see if there are any current entities residing in his house?  This is the main reason I am not allowed to do box sessions in my house for this may happen there.\n   \n  Jeff\n   \n    In a message dated 3/27/2008 9:04:46 A.M.
