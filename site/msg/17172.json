I made sure Frank was aware and okay with the listing before I went ahead and placed #38 up for auction.\n\n2. Frank made it clear that the box was mine to do with as I wished.\n\n3. I own three of Frank&#39;s devices - each of them being highly treasured.\n\n4. I made an extremely difficult decision in listing #38. I do not want to let it go. In fact, I&#39;m rather sick over it. \n\n5. It is no one&#39;s business WHY I have listed the box, but I will tell you anyway, seeing as how people would rather rush to judgment than gather the facts before criticizing. I worked extensively with #38 for a long period of time. It is a beautiful piece of &#39;ghost box&#39; history. However, it has not produced the same results (for me) that #&#39;s 37 and 73 have. I am in now in the difficult position of fighting a legal battle that has become highly expensive, yet also entirely necessary for the sake of my children - who are, by the way, my number one priority in life. \n\nOnly one individual who took issue with the listing came to me directly to inquire about my motives. One. \n\nSo, in conclusion, I don&#39;t particularly care what anyone else thinks about it. You are free to express your opinions. I am free to disregard them."}
