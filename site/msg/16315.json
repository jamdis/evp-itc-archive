I recently started up a group in PA called The Phoenixville Paranormal Society. There&#39;s a link in the LINKS area. Saw Frank&#39;s box on Ghost Adventures and had to have one. So I have myself a brand new RadioShack AM/FM self tuning radio. Cost: about $30. Catalog # 12-587. I will begin searching for the schematics to convert this but if someone can post a link to them, I would be forever grateful. \n&gt; \n&gt; When this one is done, I saw someone who build a really cool one which looks like it has outputs for recording (2 RCA jacks I think). Look forward to trading electrical-explosion and short-circuits-with-disastrous-results stories with you all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mark\n&gt; Phoenixville Paranormal Society\n&gt; http://www.mettup.com/pps-mu/\n&gt;"}
