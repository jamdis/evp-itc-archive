It would be \ndifficult for me to biased against women since I am one on the inside, \neven &quot;normal&quot; ghosts claim they see a woman. While a straight, albeit \nold, male, I prefer the feminine side of things. Purple is not so much \na type of alien, or Planet. It&#39;s a spiritual designation, as in the \nPurple Lady, or someone on a spiritual mission. I don&#39;t understand it \ncompletely either, but it&#39;s connected to the Catholics some how. I \ndon&#39;t want to get caught up in religious dogma. \n\n The people with boxes were supposed to be testing them, not going off \non ego trips, and claiming to be great mediums which was somehow \nbestowed on them by box use. There is one guy that got four, and \nclaimed none worked, so that&#39;s four out of circulation. Yeah, I am a \nbit on the gullible side. There some I can&#39;t account for, like #21, I \nhave no idea where it is, or if I skipped a number. A woman in San \nDiego did get a box directly from me last year, but somehow, Moon ended \nup with it.  After last year, of almost non-stop box building, I just \nreached a point where I dread making them for people anymore.\n\n Rosemary Guiley has one, Robin ( a local researcher&#39;s wife) got one in \nDecember for thier wedding. Woman in San Diego had one. There are women \nthat are deserving of boxes, and who have waited the longest, but I \ndread giving anymore because it creates more demand. \n\n It&#39;s just a raido for crying out loud!\n\n Frank-S"}
