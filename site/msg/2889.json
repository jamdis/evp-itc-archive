I don&#39;t get that , I can get \n&gt; stuff that&#39;s clearly not broadcast fragments, or anything else Earthly, \n&gt; why the lying crap, and why the false prophecy? Who was it that was \n&gt; quoting someone that said the spirits always lie?\n&gt;\n&gt; I think ya have to ask the questions about what it is, I think you have \n&gt; to go out on that limb and see what&#39;s out there, even if it doesn&#39;t fit \n&gt; anyone&#39;s paradigm. I think those that think they have the knowledge to \n&gt; ask the right questions, and can discern who&#39;s who in the unseen \n&gt; world.....are fools. I have these crack heads insist I&#39;m their girl, \n&gt; their Little Purple Space Princess, yes it resonates, or whatever you&#39;d \n&gt; call it, but I wouldn&#39;t trade my soul for it. The word &quot;contract&quot; has \n&gt; come up many times in my recordings, and I always tell them there ain&#39;t \n&gt; no damn contract! I go to nothingness first. Religious or not, there &#39;s \n&gt; somthing out there that buys/collects souls, and it is not a metaphor! \n&gt; You must choose your steps in life wisely, but fearlessly. Never, ever \n&gt; say &quot;I&#39;ll do anything for....&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Frank-S\n&gt;"}
