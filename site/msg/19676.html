<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, the kit is what I&#x27;ll have to save up for. Otherwise I&#x27;d be lost on what to get that it needs to operate fully. Thanks for letting me know about the lens and filters too! Our team had lost our tech guy a few years ago, and we haven&#x27;t been able to find a suitable replacement. So as the team leader, the tech aspects have fallen on me, and it&#x27;s all Greek to me. Finding any type of investigators in my area is tough. Most people just want sh--s and giggles.

Anyway, I appreciate you explaining this so clearly. I will definately be saving up for the kit.

Thanks again, Bill!

&gt; Draiga,
&gt; I&#x27;m glad to help with any info on the cameras you may need. The SC2 has a nice bundle that includes a 3 inch LCD screen that is also a miniature DVR so you can frame up your image and then record video right to the flash memory. With a battery pack (requires 8 AA) attached to the camera and the power cel built into the tiny DVR, you&#x27;ve got a high quality portable system that can go anywhere even if there is no AC power in the building, although an AC to 12VDC wall plug is included in the kit. This bundle is $320 and includes a handy clamp that has a tripod screw that fits the threads in the bottom of any model from the SC line. But if it&#x27;s the camera only you want just plug the video out of the camera into a camcorder that has a video in jack or any other video recorder that has a standard composite video line in jack.
&gt; 
&gt; Battery and recording length are about 3 hours before needed to be charged.
&gt; 
&gt; For those who want to filter out most of the visible light but allow UV &amp; IR to enter the camera the DP filter is $40 and the replacement lens that has the filter threads in the front is $22.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone is interested in any items but has questions feel free to ask. 
&gt; 
&gt; For any SC camera (except SCamCorder)purchase between now and the end of the year I&#x27;m included a free pro video shielded cable with proper connecters built in, BNC on the camera side (or an adapter), RCA for the recorder side. 
&gt; 
&gt; As mentioned previously, an SC1 purchased also has $10 off (while these units are in stock)and will recieve the video cable at no charge.
