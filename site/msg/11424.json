I have never captured an EVP, but many people have \nincluding those in this group. I cannot say (like James Randi \napparently and others like him) that I think every person who captured \nan EVP is a fraud or captured a fluke or something like that. I don&#39;t \nthink that at all, it appears to me that many of them are the real \ndeal, of that I am almost 100% certain and will be 100% certain if I \ncan ever capture my own. \n\nI don&#39;t know a lot about James Randi or EVP for that matter, but it is \na question that came up. Can anyone enlighten me? \n\nI tried a few sessions last night but came up empty handed. I am \nstarting to think my white noise isn&#39;t loud enough. I&#39;m going to keep \ntrying. \n\nAlso I hope to experiment with ITC images. And soon I want to build \na &quot;box&quot; which I keep hearing so much about. I don&#39;t know the first \nthing about these ghost/spirit boxes as I&#39;ve heard them called, all I \nknow is I want to learn to build one and use it as I&#39;ve heard some \ninteresting audio files here. But that&#39;s probably a good subject for a \nseparate post unless anyone can give me an informative how-to link or \nanything. \n\nThanks!\nAngela"}
