<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>misty,


I too a moment to think about it and realized that you and a couple 
of others here where very beneficial in my early stages of box 
research.

I would like to thank you for that initial help.

If it were not for those beginning bits of knowledge I could never 
have reached the plateau in this field that I currently enjoy.

I guess the old biblical adage is correct &quot;give a man a fish and you 
feed him for a day&quot; &quot;teach a man to fish and you feed him for a 
lifetime&quot;

I am sure that your and the groups help at the very beginning has 
helped make me the best box fisherman in the world today.

I would in closing like to extend the same courtesy. If you or any of 
the other original people who put me on the correct path, ever have 
any questions or need any help please let me know. I would be honored.

Oh yes I almost forgot, I know you have never done box research and 
do not own one. If you ever decide to give it a try I think I have an 
old 12-469 I&#x27;m not using, your more than welcome to it.

And all the help you need to get started. I would be glad to return 
the favor.


your friend
Bruce</pre>
