&gt; &gt;  At the risk of being negative yet again, all I can say is --You
&gt; have got to be friggin&#x27; kidding!? No wonder all the &#x27;serious
&gt; researchers&#x27; call it entertainment, cuz shows like that put this 
work
&gt; back with Barnum and Baily! I think they take urban myths, like the
&gt; haunted piano, and do a show on it, with all actors. Their 
demonolgist
&gt; supposedly worked on the Amityville case, ya mean the Hollywood
&gt; version, cuz the real case was nothin!?  Just watch the people
&gt; involved, and you can tell they are actors, with speech training, 
not
&gt; a single um, ah, or stutter ever uttered! It&#x27;s all just too well
&gt; rehearshed and scripted for me to watch any more of it.   Some
