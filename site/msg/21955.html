<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Confusing! I was hearing all this stuff about it being the doomsday comet, so I actaully(yeah I know, not believable) went out and looked at it, and saw it as nothing a few weeks ago. Then all these proclamations of what a nothin&#x27; it really is. I think the claims of it being distroyed are bogus--it&#x27;s just the fake prophets trying to cover their asses. &quot;My guys&quot; have, and still maintain Christmas-2012. If that proves to be nothin&#x27; as well, gonna pile the boxes up and lite them on fire! The lesson, don&#x27;t listen to internet fucktards.
