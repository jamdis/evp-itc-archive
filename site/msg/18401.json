I going to look for it, and since i don&#39;t have\n&gt;&gt; a saudering gun yet, I dare not snip anything that I can&#39;t fix again.  I\n&gt;&gt; wonder if some radio tech people knew for years about this technology, and\n&gt;&gt; just kept it quiet, because why would they put in that mute anyway?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Mon, Jul 26, 2010 3:29 am\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] AiWA picture,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    Well, easy if you know what you&#39;re looking for. You have to find the\n&gt;&gt; tuning voltage line coming form the processor, then cut it and insert your\n&gt;&gt; own tuning voltage. I didn&#39;t even know about the mute function when I did\n&gt;&gt; these, I use a different conversion method.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  I have an older, made in 1998 Radio Shack home stereo that I got out of\n&gt;&gt; the trash at work, that had the service manual wiht it, so I found the mute\n&gt;&gt; circuit and removed the two transistors to make it sweep. Then added a push\n&gt;&gt; button so the tuning button doesn&#39;t have to be held in. Push the button in\n&gt;&gt; and instant GB mode. That one collects duct too, but it&#39;s heavy.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  F-S\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jul 26, 2010 at 12:58 AM, &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   Was it easy to hack?

Where is the mute wire in it?  Is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; there a symbol for the mute?  And which board is it on, there seem to be a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; few boards in this one.
