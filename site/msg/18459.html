<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hmmm, I don&#x27;t know, I thought they were always here. Plus I don&#x27;t think
they have to be present to communicate. I used to get some saying they were
in other cities, like etheric versions of our towns.

 We seem to have an old man that died here and doesn&#x27;t to know it. I&#x27;ve
gottewn his voice twice on two different boxes, and one of the kids friend
knew the guy.

&gt; It is interesting that you posted this because I was thinking of asking the
&gt; group if using the box, a digital recorder, EVP Maker, and the like created
&gt; any odd occurences in your home. I have had things happen and it always
&gt; seems to be after I have spent some time trying to communicate with one of
&gt; those methods. Does this kind of communication bring spirits into your home?
&gt; Has anyone else had similar experiences to Rick?
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt; We&#x27;re getting our names called and asnwers to &quot;Do You Know Where You Are

&gt; &gt; we&#x27;re in the Basement......Also I believe it will bring out the EVIL

&gt; have
&gt; &gt; someone that has followed us,turning on lights in the kitchen and opening
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; kitchen cabinets up,It made me feel sick all day and affected our
&gt; cat...not to
&gt; &gt; mention simular things at our partners home...Be careful what you say and
