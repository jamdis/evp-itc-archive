MISTY\n\n                Hi, Misty.\n\nThanks for considering the ideas.  I try not to upload a whole lot, \nunless it is interesting.  It&#39;s not that I do not have recordings, \nit&#39;s just how many of these can a person store here, etc.  I would \nprefer just to maintain a small amount of them that are small file \nsize as examples of what I am doing. Just let me know of any changes \nI should make...glad to do it.  \n\nI understand moderating is a thankless job. So, thank you for doing \nit.  Not sure how anyone does it, to be honest.  It probably feels \nlike being Barney Fife in a Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield brawl on \nsome of these message boards.

That&#39;s definitely an idea to consider. Frank S. mentioned \n&gt; perhaps we can all just delete stuff after a set amount of time to \n&gt; keep it continuously clear like post stuff for couple weeks then it \n&gt; gets moved over to another server like esnips or elsewhere. All \ngood \n&gt; ideas. \n&gt; \n&gt; I already started my transition and have moved many things over as \n&gt; well as deleted. I am considering making a group account that only \n&gt; group members can upload to (esnips allows that type of file \nsharing \n&gt; between friends) I just havent had the time or focus to put into \n&gt; setting it up (thats alot of emails to type in to add as friends \n&gt; LOL). Plus they are in middle of massive changes/updates so waiting \n&gt; for the dust to settle. I also considered getting a private server \n&gt; sharing system set up so people could upload thier stuff but seems \n&gt; complicated for most who arent used to using ftp.\n&gt; \n&gt; Keep sharing ideas tho because eventually maybe we will make it \n&gt; better for everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; I rather not set limits on sizes but when ya hit 96% full \nsomethings \n&gt; gotta go LOL so we start small and work our way to the resolution. \nI \n&gt; still attach most stuff to my posts for those that get individual \n&gt; emails it comes as a simple file attachment in email. So do many \n&gt; others here.

I was just askin Frank &lt;br&gt;\nif &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; he &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knew if you were still sick or not because you had been very &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; quiet &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lately.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree sometimes its good to take a step back rather than &lt;br&gt;\nget &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself caught up in the drama fests going on around us all. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thats &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on and off the board as well. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I said I know some of what goes on off of this forum, and &lt;br&gt;\nI &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; am &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sad &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to see most of it happening. I just hope everyone can regain &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; focus &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and like you said, remember why we are here.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope you feel better soon, and rejoin us when the stress &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; level &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; passed. And I hope it passes soon so ya can run some test &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sessions &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with the new tool that arrived!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I keep telling people that all the negativity does take a &lt;br&gt;\ntoll, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; on us &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personally and our working together. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Misty&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;/a&gt;, Lisby &lt;lisby@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Get a grip--all of you.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m out of here until all this petty BS and hatred sorts &lt;br&gt;\nout. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; amount of stress that I&#39;ve been through with all this &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; fighting &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; early this year has really taken a toll on me as a person &lt;br&gt;\nand &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researcher.
