 At the bottom of the page is a shor=
twave receiver kit that is voltage tunable, it uses varactors for capacitor=
s. Someone could get this and inject a sweep signal into the tuning control=
, and you'd have an instant shortwave ghost box, which might be useful for =
remote areas. Of course it could also be used as a shortwave manual sweep r=
ig too.
 
 I was thinking (yeah, working without tools again!) I remember a=
 few years ago all the claims by some UFO related researcher how cheap fuel=
 fuel cell batteries would be out in just weeks, and we'd have batteries th=
at last 20 years, and could be re-filled with alcohol, the energy crisis ov=
er--I'm still waiting. I'm not holding my breath waiting for all the high t=
ech ghost gadgets that are supposed to be around the corner.
