<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is one of those where I&#x27;d love to hear what the rest of the

&gt; Hi Ann,
&gt;  
&gt; No question. If you see one of my files that has a question
pertaining to the message or response
&gt; it will always have the question or a portion of it preceding the
response and always be in lower case 
&gt; as apposed to the response which is always in capital letters.
&gt;  
&gt; If there is no question in the title of the file in lower case that
means the message was a random
&gt; or stray message.
