I love these. The instructor is the guide. I have heard thier instructions so many times on how to use the different systems by the time I go there I will be like an old pro LOL.
   
  You found your circle again frank! This is what I was talking about. You have the contacts on the other side, now you just have to use the ones you are close to like Frankie. It will keep your work less confusing and your messages will be more meaningful for you personally.
   
  Oh and as for the other guys ya know I thought of them while watching this show on finding Atlantis. It was talking about some of the ancient egyptian texts and how they spoke of spacemen (paraphrasing) coming to earth and taking princesses back with them.
   
  Not that they arent good contacts, just that family/friends is a safer and more reliable route to get down this path. I'd take chatting with Frankie over a spaceman any day, tho they do entertain me with the purple princess songs hehehe
   
  Hopefully he will show up more in the future for both of us and not just when the aunties drag him in to mine.
   
  Keep up the good work!
