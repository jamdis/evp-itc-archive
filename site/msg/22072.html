<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Mark, i think i am the only one out of the 4 you mentioned over here on this group.  We are all over at RTSC, there is a lot more activity over there.

Are you still a member over there?

As for an investigation, i am trying to set up a date for the Red Mill Inn.  If you are interested, i&#x27;ll add you to the list.  I&#x27;m thinking of getting Bruce Tango to hang out with us when we do it.  I told him i would go over using the ghost box with him, i gave him one a year ago.

-Steve

&gt; This is SPIRIT_RADIO, my normally used account is FUBAR so I need to use this one. I have a week off from school and actually have some time to say hey. Still need to read back through the posts to catch up.
&gt; 
&gt; Since Halloween is right around the corner, I&#x27;m checking around for an investigation to participate in. Not that Halloween has anything to do with it! Well okay, a little. 
&gt; 
&gt; Steve, Ralph, Tracy, any interest in getting another investigation under way? Is Tanya still kicking around here? 
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
