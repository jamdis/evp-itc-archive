Subject: [EVP-ITC] A suggestion for less hostility



I expect none of us =
like all the recent attacks, insults, accusations, threats, hurting of feel=
ings, and attempts to piss people off.

Can I suggest we stick to the purpo=
se of the group: "the discussion, promotion, and developemnt of Electronic =
Voice Phenomenon, and Instrumental Transcommunication methods and technolog=
ies as used in the communication with spirit, and other entities."

And tha=
t we go with Frank's philosophy "just take the approach, try different meth=
ods, see what works."

No more threats. No name calling, insults, or accusa=
tions. Just try to keep a positive group attitude, be open that not everyon=
e believes what everyone else does, and that's ok?
