It has two slots\ncut into its right half, near the center just big enough to accomidate the lower\nhalf of a hacked 587 radio in one and an Avon &quot;SpaFinder&quot; sleep noise generator\nin the other. The loudspeakers of both thus open inside the tube while the\ncontrols remain outside the pipe and are easily accessible. I must say that\nthe resonance and sound mixing in the tube are great. The noise generator has\nseveral different random sounds that might be useful, like a fairly clean &quot;white\nnoise&quot;, a &quot;water fall&quot; sound and a &quot;running stream&quot; sound with a volume control.\nOther sounds like &quot;wind chimes&quot; &quot;jungle&quot;, etc. likely are less useful, but might\nbe fun to play with.\n\nIt seems to work, but I miss a lot---I need more practice, I suppose. \n&quot;Bradley&quot;, a deceased friend of mine said his name-- and It did sound like his\nvoice. When I asked how he died--he replied &quot;accident!&quot;--which is true--he\ndrove his car under a moving train.--he said more, but I couldnt make it\nout---gotta get the tape recorder running.\n\nThe picture of Tom&#39;s Toob should be in my album. My omly problem is that I\nmight need to speed the scan up just a bit. It there a capacitor or resistor I\ncan add to do this?\n\nI like the fact that the pipe is easy to carry in one hand or on my shoulder. I\nwas inspired to use a pipe to house the components by a recent episode of &quot;Ghost\nadventures&quot;--they only had a radio in theirs though."}
