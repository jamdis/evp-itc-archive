<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve.  Was this response in relation to something you&#x27;d said?  I absolutely can hear it as 
you are, but I hear it equally well as, &quot;Howard said.&quot;  I notice this a lot in my own 
recordings, being able to hear a couple very similar sounding phrases in the same 
example.  

In regard your post about them maybe being earthbound ... I don&#x27;t know how we could 
determine that based only on what is said.  I suppose you could do a followup session to 
ask who it is, where they are, and if he was talking to you.  I know sometimes in my 
sessions, I&#x27;m essentially &#x27;eavesdropping&#x27; on an other side conversation, and what is being 
said doesn&#x27;t really apply to me.  Sort of like picking up on a party phone line.
