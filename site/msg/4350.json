My fist sesion ever was with the older \n12-470 in the open air, using a digital recorder.  I got results \nduring that one.  I have yet to run a real session (other than some \ntesting) with my other configurations.\nMaybe later this week sometime.\n\nThanks for sharing!\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike, I had an incredible session yesterday with the 12-469 and \namped \n&gt; speakers.  I have not uploaded the file, yet, but I am ruined.  \nGreat \n&gt; questioning and answering...very discernable.  It seems when the \n&gt; person operating the device tunes in, the mish mash of audio bits \n&gt; become something else when the spirits start using it.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Halliday said, no box needed with these radios.  The box made it \n&gt; difficult to record clearer voices and made things a bit muffled \nfor \n&gt; me.  I made an echo chamber and used a sound chamber, but didn&#39;t \nlike \n&gt; it as well.  The amplified speakers seem to give a nice &quot;hiss&quot; \nwhich \n&gt; fills in the gaps with white noise (?), but that hiss makes it \n&gt; difficult for clarity when dropped in a chamber. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now I am excited to use the 12-470 (older version) without the \n&gt; chambers and with (just to compare, as well).\n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; http://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ahhh... Welcome to the world of 12-470 (older version) \nownership.  \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; think you will find it a bit better than the 12-469, in my \nopinion \n&gt; &gt; anyway.  I guess since I own both models... I can say that after \na \n&gt; &gt; side by side comparison.  You can say goodbye to that AM sweep \n&gt; &gt; clicking found on the 12-469, anyway.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Enjoy your new experimental device... once it arrives!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you.
