Babs,
 
I am thinking of contacting ron the maker of the mini box and offer=
 
to put a page on my box website explaining the do's and don'ts of box res=
earch and the dangers involved and also the resposibility involed in box 
o=
wnership and research. And I'm hoping that will help some of the people who=
 are going in blind and buying a mini box will understand what the basics a=
re.
 
hopefully they can put a link on their mini box sale page.

Hi Bruce~I understand the light he=
artedness of the "family hour" posts. I don'ttake any issue with that at al=
l. The families of those of us involvedin the paranormal HAVE to be a bit d=
ifferent then the average Joe's orSmith's. I only referred to that topic be=
cause of the other stuffmentioned- negativity and dark ones.There is absolu=
tely nothing in place to safe guard who purchases thebox and who doesn't be=
sides the cost. If you've got the money or acredit card, the box is yours- =
whoever "you" are.I don't think we should presume anything about the purcha=
sers of thebox. I know people in the filed who have never experienced anyth=
ingevil or dark and wouldn't know what to do if they did. Admittedly,they c=
an be and will be deceitful. I am in full support of further research and g=
roups and individualsworking together. However, IMHO, I think this falls in=
to a differentcategory. Morally and ethically, I think it is short sighted =
toapprove of or promote in any way, the distribution of this device atthis =

I am a fairly quiet person, most of the time. I have my thoughtsandopinions=

tohappen. We all know one or twopeople who we can say "felt dark" fromthe f=
