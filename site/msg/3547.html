Portals keep PI's in business! Sorry, could not resist. I have heard so man=
y stories from people who have had PI's at their house. "They told me the p=
ortal is in my kids closet"! "Sorry, Mrs. Hancock but that smell is not a d=
emon, it is your son's dirty sneakers"! LOL

 That's =

I consider it suspect, at best. Others here have goten voices that mention =
both Tesla and Edison, but none run to public to announce the one and only,=
 real contacts. Wiht no other validation, or information, getting the name =

 I've never seen a portal, so how would one know if a =
portal was somehwere if it can't be detected.

YOURS (you own
it still) and refuses to return it to you (once you send him=
 a letter

Public)???? Put him "out of business" in making money/profits from
YOU=
R box! This seem unethical in what he's now doing, don't ya think?
My 2c wo=
