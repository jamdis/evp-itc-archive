&gt; &gt; Everyone,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Can harmony and resonance be had? Yes it can. It takes a certain 
&gt; level of acceptance though. You have to accept the fact that every 
&gt; entity in existence is not spiritually equal but has the capability 
&gt; to become equal. Every entity has a right to this knowledge and has 
&gt; the ability to gain it with or without technical means. You have to 
&gt; accept that all realities are true in the eyes of those who behold 
&gt; them. Finally, you have to respect and accept people for what they 
&gt; are and know that all things will work out exactly how they are 
&gt; supposed to.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ll give him this: he has amazing balls to be using Frank&#x27;s device 
&gt; and tell ing the rest who are also using them that his is the only 
&gt; one that works. If I were Frank, I&#x27;d be beating my head against the 
&gt; wall. Oh. Wait. He already is.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What a total load of ego-driven crap. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Chris, if you&#x27;re reading, may I suggest that you are the one who is 
&gt; falling victim to &quot;false&quot; communication? Or that your head is getting 
&gt; waaaay too big? Or if you already know that you&#x27;re just in it for the 
&gt; cash, that you find another way to pay your bills?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You know, though, this same shit has happened to every group of 
&gt; paranormal researchers since the field began. I&#x27;ve watched group 
&gt; after group come together and explode for thirty years because only 
&gt; the Chosen had the right to control the message, would broke no 
&gt; criticism of *any* of their own results *ever*, but had plenty of 
&gt; definitive pronouncements about everyone else&#x27;s.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is why I scoff at the idea of &quot;Harmony,&quot; with the capital H. I 
&gt; have seen the concept used by everyone from the Warrens in the 60s-
&gt; 70s to the Harsch-Fischbachs in the early 80s to Moon today trying to 
&gt; use this idea of being somehow chosen and sacred in order to 
&gt; get &quot;real&quot; messages from spirit. Harmony is a way to control who gets 
&gt; to play and IMHO, it&#x27;s a load of nonsense.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Bruce, I have to tell you that the message you got the other day 
&gt; about us being all Kumbaya set my alarms off, perhaps innocently, but 
&gt; nonetheless. I&#x27;ve found there is such a fine line between real peace 
&gt; between brothers working for the real common good and peace between 
&gt; brothers as a mechanism of control. Yes, we need to be at peace to 
&gt; work together. But that peace has to be an inclusive peace. It has to 
&gt; be a peace within one&#x27;s self above all else. It needs to be a 
&gt; *fearless* interior peace, too. The Harmony is within, folks. It&#x27;s 
&gt; not judging whether others have it or not before we let them play. It 
&gt; is pure, unadulterated *internal* knowledge about one&#x27;s self. Judge 
&gt; not, lest ye be judged--remember that one?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; HMO YMMV, toujours,
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; Here is a blog steve sent me from moons myspace page as usual he&#x27;s 
&gt; in 
&gt; &gt; a panic because his fraudulent buisness is going down the tubes. he 
&gt; &gt; claims to know the only way box communication can be achieved but 
&gt; who 
&gt; &gt; would know better than the box inventor. Frank says it does not 
&gt; &gt; matter what means you use it&#x27;s the researcher that counts.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; and if moon is so omnipitent in this research where are the 
&gt; &gt; documented recordings of his research, why are they not public for 
&gt; &gt; everyone to hear maybe because he&#x27;s full of bull. he said recently 
&gt; &gt; that no one but him gets legitimate communication, well I think 
&gt; it&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; the other way around. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; chris if you read this, stop the cherade and have some dignity. 
&gt; &gt; become a real researcher and stop trying to down everyone else so 
&gt; you 
&gt; &gt; can continue to pray on the berieved and desperate people. And 
&gt; while 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m at it, if your so great why are you offering substantial 
&gt; &gt; discounts to your so called ghost hunter university. I&#x27;ll tell you 
&gt; &gt; why, because people are starting to realise you are nothing but a 
&gt; &gt; carnival side show palm raeder and have fooled people long enough. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; the reason I am addresing moon directly on this group is I know he 
&gt; is 
&gt; &gt; lurking in the shadows to see what is happening with real 
&gt; researchers 
&gt; &gt; and will know at least what I think of him.
&gt; &gt; I have done more legitimate box research in one week than he has 
&gt; done 
&gt; &gt; ever. My results are posted I challenge him to do the same.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; here is a copy of his malicious blog from myspace.
&gt; &gt; chris moon&#x27;s blog on myspace this morning ***
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Wednesday, November 28, 2007 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The Box has hit the fan! 
&gt; &gt; Current mood: distressed 
&gt; &gt; Category: Dreams and the Supernatural 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As so many of you know, I have been the __primary tester__ of the 
&gt; &gt; Telephone to the Dead, a.k.a. &quot;Frank&#x27;s Box&quot; since 2004, and have 
&gt; had 
&gt; &gt; __great success using it__ in paranormal research, and more currently, 
&gt; &gt; __connecting the living with those on the other side__. I have recently 
&gt; &gt; been made aware that there are __several replica versions of this 
&gt; &gt; device__ being sold. I have also __been told of another device that can 
&gt; &gt; be purchased for very little from any electronics merchant and 
&gt; &gt; altered by hand, producing what some consider to be results__. As I 
&gt; &gt; expected, the __samples that people have sent me__ are nothing more 
&gt; than 
&gt; &gt; __timed radio scans that have no validity__. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What is important to remember, before purchasing any of these 
&gt; replica 
&gt; &gt; devices, is that __the Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides on the 
&gt; &gt; other side__ have __repeatedly explained__ that the way that the 
&gt; Telephone 
&gt; &gt; to the Dead technology works, is by spirit energy manipulating the 
&gt; &gt; random voltage generator (RVG) and using white and pink noise, as 
&gt; &gt; well as radio fragment, to create real time voice answers to 
&gt; &gt; questions posed from our side. __The most important aspect to this 
&gt; &gt; device__ is __the medium operator__ who works as an antenna 
&gt; &gt; or &quot;__interpreter&quot; for living individuals asking the questions__. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; __Thomas Edison, in an intelligent spiritual discussion through the 
&gt; &gt; Telephone to the Dead, stated__ that there were only __thirty of these 
&gt; &gt; individuals__ that __could effectively use the device__. Four have been 
&gt; &gt; identified to this point. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; __I have spent nearly four years testing and doing paranormal 
&gt; research 
&gt; &gt; with the Telephone to the Dead, and I have built strong 
&gt; relationships 
&gt; &gt; with Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides who I trust, and who 
&gt; trust 
&gt; &gt; me__. These new &quot;__radio scanners&quot; are not only a waste of money__ for 
&gt; &gt; people looking to __do research with them__ in hopes of having 
&gt; effective 
&gt; &gt; communication with the other side, but may __in fact be very 
&gt; dangerous. 
&gt; &gt; Should demonic and other negative entities__ learn to use these __false 
&gt; &gt; devices, the results could be devastating__. Though I rarely see eye 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; eye with __the Catholic Church on the matter of using the Telephone 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; the Dead__, I do admit that __they predicted__ the widespread sale of 
&gt; __false 
&gt; &gt; communication devices__ as far back as last year. I have recently 
&gt; begun 
&gt; &gt; to __receive requests from individuals asking for help__ to close 
&gt; &gt; __negative doorways and portals__ that __they believe__ they opened using 
&gt; &gt; their __purchased__ Telephone to the Dead __replica__. Others are claiming 
&gt; &gt; that I am a fraud because their __purchased device doesn&#x27;t produce 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; __positive results I have been fortunate enough to have__, and __claim__ 
&gt; that 
&gt; &gt; therefore, __all of my results MUST be false__. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I can __see this spiraling out of control already__. Once again, __I will 
&gt; &gt; continue__ my research with the __actual Telephone to the Dead__ as well 
&gt; as 
&gt; &gt; __provide public demonstrations__ and __private readings__ for those __truly 
&gt; &gt; interested__ in real time spirit communication. Please feel free to 
&gt; &gt; __contact me__ with any questions at

&gt; &gt; = = = = = = = = = = = = = =      H All, Hmmm?! The Catholic Church, BTW, does NOT allow or believe in communications with the Dead (Necromancy) + even in the Bible it is stated as forbiden!  That&#x27;s for all those Religious folk&#x27;s out there.  I&#x27;m a Spiritual, non-religious, person who believes in EVP&#x27;s! I have never even gotten negative &quot;doorways opened&quot; or &quot;Portals&quot; with negative entities by using a cassette recorder or even a OUIJA Board, for that matter. IF people want to believe in demons, negative entities entering thru Portals or doorways . . . . I&#x27;d say those people need to seek Mental Heath professionals - for help, Not Chris Moon! Here, it&#x27;s obvious to me, that he (Very Arrogantly) is again promoting himself (as the ONLY one) who knows how to genuinely work (or interpret as a Medium does) Frank&#x27;s Box, which HE has renamed, The Telephone to the Dead, and puts down all other devices as replicas that are invalid and a waste of money! Just read, in between the lines (I&#x27;ve marked above) and see what he&#x27;s really saying!! Think about this! I still feel Frank IS the &quot;primary tester&quot; of HIS boxes!    =Judy=
