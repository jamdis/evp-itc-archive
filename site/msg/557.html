It's good to see another like minded researcher. Groups are good for a few reasons.. you can meet other like minded people, you can bounce ideas off each other and get inspiration for new ideas, perhaps learn a few things and hear things from another perspective.
   
  Groups are comprised of individuals, and since everyone has thier own viewpoint unfortunately sometimes a conflict can arise. It is important to move past that and maintain some sort of harmony for our own sakes as well as the sake of the work we are doing. 
   
  I'd love to see some of your results, evp and imagery. I am always in the "learning stage" as far as any of this goes. I learn something new almost every day and its refreshing to talk to others with similar interests doing the same sort of work.
   
  My purpose for this work is to simply explore, learn, and improve my contact...on both sides of the veil.

            Thanks for the evp Misty! Will listen to them in a moment but just sending you this message to let you know that I got them here. I can only listen to a few EVP at a time because after that it seems like some of my own contacts butt in -- ever had that happen to you? I know that sounds inexplicable but I'm hoping this group will consider that even inexplicable things happen in groups that focus on the well...  inexplicable. :)
   
  I've been experimenting in EVP/ITC for awhile now. I don't belong to any online forum/group other than this one at this present time but at least for now, I think I would like to give another shot at it -- gulp. I'm guessing there are a lot of people like me out there who have been really turned off by all of the shinanigan's that go on in these online forums/groups but, I read your one post about how important it is that groups should strive for peace and harmony as much as humanly possible or else all suffers including even each members  contacts with these other "worlds"; or something to that effect...
  I'm a Survivalist, but I also believe that some of us are in contact with those dimensions occupied by beings of various kinds -- perhaps even extraterrestrial -- who knows? though it's my hunch that most of these other beings are terrestrial yet unseen most of the time except in ITC and alternate states of consciousness -- AND, some of us are better at peering into the rabbit hole than others -- that's a given. Too bad there are those who have a tough time accepting that.  
  I do EVP --  and also do ITC with my crappy little webcam. I've seen your images in your gallery and I'm very impressed by them. In fact, I think they are the best I've ever seen so far and it's so refreshing to see that you seem to have no ego issues which is remarkable in itself. Lol, I must say, a rarity indeed!
   Perhaps this is one of the reasons why "they" are communicating to you so clearly as they are: of this I am certain. Keep up the good work! Your research in this field inspires all of us (though most will not admit it -- he,he) and even if we can't get the same kind of results you do, I for one can say that it's enough for me to see that there are others, such as yourself, who have whatever it takes to get the kind of images thats been granted to you, somehow, someway -- too bad there aren't more like you in this field at this particular time but it could be that those who are, are not posting things online and for good reason -- jealousy and envy are very POWERFUL emotions and it's best to stay as far away as possible from groups that are generating that. I can't emphasize this more than that at this point in time but I know you already know that.

    Welcome to the group. 
   
  Sure I can repost for you. Deciding on which one to post...well thats the hard part LOL since I have had some newer ones that some may find easier to hear.
   
  Glad to hear you are interested in ITC. It is a fascinating subject. Perhaps you could tell me a little about what got you interested in it or any experiences you have had with it.
   
  I enjoy both the voice and image aspects of it. During the last year I have probably collected over 1000 sound bits and hundreds of images. I never ask anyone to believe me or any of my evidence, only that they look into it for themselves reguardless of what they think of my personal stuff.
   
  So everyone feel free to share and comment. Feedback is always good, it helps us and it helps "them" too. In the meantime I will repost a couple things for you including a few "welcome" introduction files from them to start/end our sessions. 
   
  Hope you can hear them. Enjoy!

  Hi Misty,
I just switched my acct over to receive email from this group in my 
email inbox. Sorry for the inconvenience, but could you re-post what 
you feel is the best evp from your most recent batch for me to hear? 
By the way, this is my first post here. Joined up a couple of weeks 
ago but didn't have the time until now to post anything here. Found 
this group after doing a search for ITC groups... thanks :)
