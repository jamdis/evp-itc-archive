I&#x27;m thinking there&#x27;s something wrong with the tuner. You should be able to 
see the buzzing on a scope, and trace it back. One problem I did find is 
that the audio limiter tends to increase the noise level. I think it&#x27;s gain 
jumps up when no voice fragments are present, and over amplifies the noise 
between stations, the result is a contant noise level that buries the 
voices, but it&#x27;s not like that buzz. I bypassed the limiter in box #12, and 
it works so good, I left the circuit off the newest system.

&gt;Hello Frank,
&gt;
&gt;    Thanks for mentioning the buzzing, I was hoping the buzzing wasn&#x27;t
&gt;part of the design :-) I&#x27;ll get a scope on it and check it out, I
&gt;didn&#x27;t want to mess with it for fear that I might be changing
&gt;something that was intended for communication in the circuit.
&gt;
&gt;During the session we did change the location of the box because of
&gt;all of the buzzing thinking it may have been some noisy wiring nearby,
&gt;but it did not make a difference, so we just went with it.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Craig T

&gt; &gt; Hi Craig;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That buzzing is awful! I can&#x27;t hear much beyond that. If anyone can,
&gt;have a
&gt; &gt; tech check the power supply voltages at the board, there should be
&gt;plus and
&gt; &gt; minus 12 volts for the RVG, and pus 12 for the audio/tuner section.
&gt;Look at
&gt; &gt; it with a scope, maybe there a bad regulator, or bad power switch
&gt;section.
&gt; &gt; The way it is, that box is about useless.
&gt; &gt;
