I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning system. I tried several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner through the AM band late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the dial moving at a constant rate of speed. This is not nearly as good as Frank&#x27;s &#x27;hands off&#x27; random tuning method but it still produced some results. What impressed me most is that some of the voices sound the same, even though I tuned through several channels. This attached capture could be a technical message.
&quot;Plug a million hertz&quot;   One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which is close the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.
