In particular they can make use of \n&gt; certain instruments to propel thier voice across. So last night I \n&gt; played a short clip of Joe Satriani&#39;s &quot;always with you always with \n&gt; me&quot; it contains music only, no vocals. I discovered that in the \nfirst \n&gt; few seconds of the clip the voices were able to sustain a loud, \n&gt; comprehensive line of communication until Satriani kicked it into \n&gt; high gear and the guitar notes were too loud and drowned everything \n&gt; out. Some could be heard on regular playback, most could be heard \n&gt; clearer at a slowed down rate of -74% & -30%. I then did a session \n&gt; with no music. Both sessions lasted under 1 minute and both \nsessions \n&gt; had a yeild of about 18 clips/sentences. The difference being that \n&gt; more of the music clips were louder and clearer to understand for \nme \n&gt; and hopefully for you too. \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   Heres a few of the evp clips for you to download and evaluate. \n&gt; Many are very loud so I recommend you lower the sound DOWN... ALOT \n&gt; til you play it once to see what volume level it has. I use stereo \n&gt; speakers so I am used to blasting my head off LOL so careful you \ndont \n&gt; blow a speaker or your eardrums. Even I usually turn them down \n&gt; because the level of vibration and noise may be too much for my \ndogs \n&gt; ears. The process I used was the same, p1 filter only, amped at +15 \n&gt; which works differently depending on what comes across and what I \n&gt; used for background sound. When using music the noise level is \n&gt; definitely alot higher and you will need to lower your sound for \n&gt; those LOL\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   Only sharing some of the ones I think others can hear. The \nmusic \n&gt; session had alot more than the nonmusic session. I will send a \nshort \n&gt; clip of satriani (the first part where the voices were the best) so \n&gt; that if anyone wants to give it a try they can.\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   Misty\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Check out the all-new Yahoo!
