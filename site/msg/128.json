There was nothing around us to creat=\r\ne that odor (not even in the woods), so I&#39;m guessing they were sending it t=\r\no us. When I say &quot;what are these&quot; I was picking up some of those purple flo=\r\nwers that grow from clover.  They did not produce the scent we were smellin=\r\ng!! It was incredible.
