This is what troubles me, I get these supposed Earthquake predictions, the=

today. That's what I try to get across, you can't take this shit like it's =
written in stone, or some kind of friggin' gospel, as most seem prone to do=

hink you can say with any certainty it's sprits of the deceased, at least n=
ot all of it, there's that level of deception that I don't kow what do to w=
ith. When someone tells me they have the knowledge to know what questions t=
o ask to verify the personality, I have to conclude they are absolutely clu=
eless. I don't care how many books they've written, or how many "universiti=
es" they've given. When something knows how you think, what you are perceiv=
ing, and how it's being perceived, you can't prevent yourself from being de=
ceived, or more like played with. I know I'll be deceived, and tricked, and=
 I tell them have fun with that, cuz I don't really care. I'm not after any=
 particular spirit, or piece of knowledge.    When these voices tell someon=
e not to share the information, that's even thinner ice to on!  I still, ev=
eryday, question the value of this work, and if it warrents continuing. I c=

 me! I find the communication mode itself facsinating, and don't expect tha=
