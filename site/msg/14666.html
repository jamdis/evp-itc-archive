Me? I am doing this for myself first and foremost. If others gain something=
 from work I am doing, great, but I am only in it to further my own knowled=
ge, and not for self aggrandizement or fame, but to satisfy my own curiosit=
y, and maybe for some cheap thrills to boot :)

  There's only one important question at the monent, are you service=

 years, I'd use the time wisely.

             I left the name off this, bu=
