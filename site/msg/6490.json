Space is limited here and you are all \nnearing the 100% mark so try to keep your section under 5 megs. If \nyou need more space use www.esnips.com and you can store 50 gigs to \nshare with the group or public.\n\nI think it is great you guys have so much to share I just wish that \nour yahoo group wasnt so limited on space (and that I wasnt so \nlimited on time). But I have found a way around it. If just a few \npeople signed up and shared using esnips they can invite others to \nvisit thier files and once they do they also get 50 gigs of free \nspace for audio pictures or video or whatever you want to post.\n\nI was considering setting up one &quot;group&quot; account to start with and \ninviting all members who post files to join it and be able to post to \nthe account. It will automatically notify everyone thats a member \nwhen a file is added to it just like the yahoo group does. It also \nallows you to share with the public or privately if you so choose. \nYou can even allow your friends to post to your account if you wish.\n\nThis group has grown and expanded and we just need to make a few \nchanges to how we do things to keep it running more smoothly for the \nfuture. I am hoping that you all will help me in this endeavor. I \nknow many of you have already adapted the idea to help us organize \nand maintain the group.\n\nI want you to keep sharing and to be able to share more! \n\nSo please organize and not post stray files that are targets for \ndeletion once the que is 100% full. And for your own sake, if no one \nelses, be respectful to each other.\n\nMD"}
