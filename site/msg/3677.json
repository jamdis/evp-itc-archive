Yes it can. It takes a certain \n&gt; level of acceptance though. You have to accept the fact that every \n&gt; entity in existence is not spiritually equal but has the capability \n&gt; to become equal. Every entity has a right to this knowledge and has \n&gt; the ability to gain it with or without technical means. You have to \n&gt; accept that all realities are true in the eyes of those who behold \n&gt; them. Finally, you have to respect and accept people for what they \n&gt; are and know that all things will work out exactly how they are \n&gt; supposed to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Frank R.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; &gt; From: Lisby &lt;lisby@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, November 29, 2007 10:54:03 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] chris(jack ass)moon at it again\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt;             \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll give him this: he has amazing balls to be using Frank&#39;s device \n&gt; and tell ing the rest who are also using them that his is the only \n&gt; one that works. If I were Frank, I&#39;d be beating my head against the \n&gt; wall. Oh. Wait. He already is.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What a total load of ego-driven crap. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Chris, if you&#39;re reading, may I suggest that you are the one who is \n&gt; falling victim to &quot;false&quot; communication? Or that your head is getting \n&gt; waaaay too big? Or if you already know that you&#39;re just in it for the \n&gt; cash, that you find another way to pay your bills?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You know, though, this same shit has happened to every group of \n&gt; paranormal researchers since the field began. I&#39;ve watched group \n&gt; after group come together and explode for thirty years because only \n&gt; the Chosen had the right to control the message, would broke no \n&gt; criticism of *any* of their own results *ever*, but had plenty of \n&gt; definitive pronouncements about everyone else&#39;s.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is why I scoff at the idea of &quot;Harmony,&quot; with the capital H. I \n&gt; have seen the concept used by everyone from the Warrens in the 60s-\n&gt; 70s to the Harsch-Fischbachs in the early 80s to Moon today trying to \n&gt; use this idea of being somehow chosen and sacred in order to \n&gt; get &quot;real&quot; messages from spirit. Harmony is a way to control who gets \n&gt; to play and IMHO, it&#39;s a load of nonsense.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce, I have to tell you that the message you got the other day \n&gt; about us being all Kumbaya set my alarms off, perhaps innocently, but \n&gt; nonetheless. I&#39;ve found there is such a fine line between real peace \n&gt; between brothers working for the real common good and peace between \n&gt; brothers as a mechanism of control. Yes, we need to be at peace to \n&gt; work together. But that peace has to be an inclusive peace. It has to \n&gt; be a peace within one&#39;s self above all else. It needs to be a \n&gt; *fearless* interior peace, too. The Harmony is within, folks. It&#39;s \n&gt; not judging whether others have it or not before we let them play. It \n&gt; is pure, unadulterated *internal* knowledge about one&#39;s self. Judge \n&gt; not, lest ye be judged--remember that one?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; HMO YMMV, toujours,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Nov 29, 2007, at 9:15 AM, bhali333 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here is a blog steve sent me from moons myspace page as usual he&#39;s \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; a panic because his fraudulent buisness is going down the tubes. he \n&gt; &gt; claims to know the only way box communication can be achieved but \n&gt; who \n&gt; &gt; would know better than the box inventor. Frank says it does not \n&gt; &gt; matter what means you use it&#39;s the researcher that counts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and if moon is so omnipitent in this research where are the \n&gt; &gt; documented recordings of his research, why are they not public for \n&gt; &gt; everyone to hear maybe because he&#39;s full of bull. he said recently \n&gt; &gt; that no one but him gets legitimate communication, well I think \n&gt; it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; the other way around. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; chris if you read this, stop the cherade and have some dignity. \n&gt; &gt; become a real researcher and stop trying to down everyone else so \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; can continue to pray on the berieved and desperate people. And \n&gt; while \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m at it, if your so great why are you offering substantial \n&gt; &gt; discounts to your so called ghost hunter university. I&#39;ll tell you \n&gt; &gt; why, because people are starting to realise you are nothing but a \n&gt; &gt; carnival side show palm raeder and have fooled people long enough. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; the reason I am addresing moon directly on this group is I know he \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; lurking in the shadows to see what is happening with real \n&gt; researchers \n&gt; &gt; and will know at least what I think of him.\n&gt; &gt; I have done more legitimate box research in one week than he has \n&gt; done \n&gt; &gt; ever. My results are posted I challenge him to do the same.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; here is a copy of his malicious blog from myspace.\n&gt; &gt; chris moon&#39;s blog on myspace this morning ***\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wednesday, November 28, 2007 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Box has hit the fan! \n&gt; &gt; Current mood: distressed \n&gt; &gt; Category: Dreams and the Supernatural \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As so many of you know, I have been the __primary tester__ of the \n&gt; &gt; Telephone to the Dead, a.k.a. &quot;Frank&#39;s Box&quot; since 2004, and have \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; __great success using it__ in paranormal research, and more currently, \n&gt; &gt; __connecting the living with those on the other side__. I have recently \n&gt; &gt; been made aware that there are __several replica versions of this \n&gt; &gt; device__ being sold. I have also __been told of another device that can \n&gt; &gt; be purchased for very little from any electronics merchant and \n&gt; &gt; altered by hand, producing what some consider to be results__. As I \n&gt; &gt; expected, the __samples that people have sent me__ are nothing more \n&gt; than \n&gt; &gt; __timed radio scans that have no validity__. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What is important to remember, before purchasing any of these \n&gt; replica \n&gt; &gt; devices, is that __the Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides on the \n&gt; &gt; other side__ have __repeatedly explained__ that the way that the \n&gt; Telephone \n&gt; &gt; to the Dead technology works, is by spirit energy manipulating the \n&gt; &gt; random voltage generator (RVG) and using white and pink noise, as \n&gt; &gt; well as radio fragment, to create real time voice answers to \n&gt; &gt; questions posed from our side. __The most important aspect to this \n&gt; &gt; device__ is __the medium operator__ who works as an antenna \n&gt; &gt; or &quot;__interpreter&quot; for living individuals asking the questions__. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __Thomas Edison, in an intelligent spiritual discussion through the \n&gt; &gt; Telephone to the Dead, stated__ that there were only __thirty of these \n&gt; &gt; individuals__ that __could effectively use the device__. Four have been \n&gt; &gt; identified to this point. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __I have spent nearly four years testing and doing paranormal \n&gt; research \n&gt; &gt; with the Telephone to the Dead, and I have built strong \n&gt; relationships \n&gt; &gt; with Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides who I trust, and who \n&gt; trust \n&gt; &gt; me__. These new &quot;__radio scanners&quot; are not only a waste of money__ for \n&gt; &gt; people looking to __do research with them__ in hopes of having \n&gt; effective \n&gt; &gt; communication with the other side, but may __in fact be very \n&gt; dangerous. \n&gt; &gt; Should demonic and other negative entities__ learn to use these __false \n&gt; &gt; devices, the results could be devastating__. Though I rarely see eye \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; eye with __the Catholic Church on the matter of using the Telephone \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; the Dead__, I do admit that __they predicted__ the widespread sale of \n&gt; __false \n&gt; &gt; communication devices__ as far back as last year. I have recently \n&gt; begun \n&gt; &gt; to __receive requests from individuals asking for help__ to close \n&gt; &gt; __negative doorways and portals__ that __they believe__ they opened using \n&gt; &gt; their __purchased__ Telephone to the Dead __replica__. Others are claiming \n&gt; &gt; that I am a fraud because their __purchased device doesn&#39;t produce \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; __positive results I have been fortunate enough to have__, and __claim__ \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; therefore, __all of my results MUST be false__. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I can __see this spiraling out of control already__. Once again, __I will \n&gt; &gt; continue__ my research with the __actual Telephone to the Dead__ as well \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; __provide public demonstrations__ and __private readings__ for those __truly \n&gt; &gt; interested__ in real time spirit communication. Please feel free to \n&gt; &gt; __contact me__ with any questions at\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; = = = = = = = = = = = = = =      H All, Hmmm?! The Catholic Church, BTW, does NOT allow or believe in communications with the Dead (Necromancy) + even in the Bible it is stated as forbiden!  That&#39;s for all those Religious folk&#39;s out there.  I&#39;m a Spiritual, non-religious, person who believes in EVP&#39;s! I have never even gotten negative &quot;doorways opened&quot; or &quot;Portals&quot; with negative entities by using a cassette recorder or even a OUIJA Board, for that matter. IF people want to believe in demons, negative entities entering thru Portals or doorways . . . . I&#39;d say those people need to seek Mental Heath professionals - for help, Not Chris Moon! Here, it&#39;s obvious to me, that he (Very Arrogantly) is again promoting himself (as the ONLY one) who knows how to genuinely work (or interpret as a Medium does) Frank&#39;s Box, which HE has renamed, The Telephone to the Dead, and puts down all other devices as replicas that are invalid and a waste of money! Just read, in between the lines (I&#39;ve marked above) and see what he&#39;s really saying!! Think about this! I still feel Frank IS the &quot;primary tester&quot; of HIS boxes!    =Judy= \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;!--\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mkp{\n&gt; &gt; border:1px solid #d8d8d8;font-family:Arial;margin:14px \n&gt; 0px;padding:0px 14px;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mkp hr{\n&gt; &gt; border:1px solid #d8d8d8;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mkp #hd{\n&gt; &gt; color:#628c2a;font-size:85%;font-weight:bold;line-\n&gt; height:122%;margin:10px 0px;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mkp #ads{\n&gt; &gt; margin-bottom:10px;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mkp .ad{\n&gt; &gt; padding:0 0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mkp .ad a{\n&gt; &gt; color:#0000ff;text-decoration:none;}\n&gt; &gt; --&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;!--\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc{\n&gt; &gt; font-family:Arial;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc #hd{\n&gt; &gt; margin:10px 0px;font-weight:bold;font-size:78%;line-height:122%;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc .ad{\n&gt; &gt; margin-bottom:10px;padding:0 0;}\n&gt; &gt; --&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;!--\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mlmsg {font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, \n&gt; sans-serif;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mlmsg table {font-size:inherit;font:100%;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mlmsg select, input, textarea {font:99% arial, helvetica, \n&gt; clean, sans-serif;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mlmsg pre, code {font:115% monospace;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mlmsg * {line-height:1.22em;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-text{\n&gt; &gt; font-family:Georgia;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-text p{\n&gt; &gt; margin:0 0 1em 0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-tpmsgs{\n&gt; &gt; font-family:Arial;\n&gt; &gt; clear:both;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vitnav{\n&gt; &gt; padding-top:10px;font-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;margin:0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vitnav a{\n&gt; &gt; padding:0 1px;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-actbar{\n&gt; &gt; clear:both;margin:25px 0;white-space:nowrap;color:#666;text-\n&gt; align:right;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-actbar .left{\n&gt; &gt; float:left;white-space:nowrap;}\n&gt; &gt; .bld{font-weight:bold;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-grft{\n&gt; &gt; font-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;padding:15px 0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-ft{\n&gt; &gt; font-family:verdana;font-size:77%;border-top:1px solid #666;\n&gt; &gt; padding:5px 0;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mlmsg #logo{\n&gt; &gt; padding-bottom:10px;}\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital{\n&gt; &gt; background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:2px 0 8px 8px;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital #vithd{\n&gt; &gt; font-size:77%;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;color:#333;text-\n&gt; transform:uppercase;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital ul{\n&gt; &gt; padding:0;margin:2px 0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital ul li{\n&gt; &gt; list-style-type:none;clear:both;border:1px solid #e0ecee;\n&gt; &gt; }\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital ul li .ct{\n&gt; &gt; font-weight:bold;color:#ff7900;float:right;width:2em;text-\n&gt; align:right;padding-right:.5em;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital ul li .cat{\n&gt; &gt; font-weight:bold;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital a{\n&gt; &gt; text-decoration:none;}\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital a:hover{\n&gt; &gt; text-decoration:underline;}\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #hd{\n&gt; &gt; color:#999;font-size:77%;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov{\n&gt; &gt; padding:6px 13px;background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov ul{\n&gt; &gt; padding:0 0 0 8px;margin:0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov li{\n&gt; &gt; list-style-type:square;padding:6px 0;font-size:77%;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov li a{\n&gt; &gt; text-decoration:none;font-size:130%;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #nc{\n&gt; &gt; background-color:#eee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:0 8px;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad{\n&gt; &gt; padding:8px 0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad #hd1{\n&gt; &gt; font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#628c2a;font-\n&gt; size:100%;line-height:122%;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad a{\n&gt; &gt; text-decoration:none;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad a:hover{\n&gt; &gt; text-decoration:underline;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad p{\n&gt; &gt; margin:0;}\n&gt; &gt; o{font-size:0;}\n&gt; &gt; .MsoNormal{\n&gt; &gt; margin:0 0 0 0;}\n&gt; &gt; #ygrp-text tt{\n&gt; &gt; font-size:120%;}\n&gt; &gt; blockquote{margin:0 0 0 4px;}\n&gt; &gt; .replbq{margin:4;}\n&gt; &gt; --&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       \n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ______________\n&gt; &gt; Be a better pen pal. \n&gt; &gt; Text or chat with friends inside Yahoo!
