<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello everyone - Bill here.  Been facinated with EVPs on C2C for 
years and a few days ago realized that I have a room full of high end 
audio and video recording equipment, 4 computers and software to do 
anything with anything...Hey!  I can set something up to do EVPs!  
I&#x27;ve got a starter set on my desktop that worked on the first try 
and &quot;Rick&quot; (my contact)has been helpful in getting it fine tuned. 
Desktop setup uses EVPmaker chewing up a 1 minute segment of a man 
giving a talk, with white noise (EVP said &quot;use that noise&quot;)in a loop 
on Soundbooth.  I use a AKG 414 mike about 18&quot; from the computer 
speakers and simply lean over it to ask questions, and record on to 
Audition. 
   My next move is to create a laptop based system using as few 
components as possible. I&#x27;m looking at the RadioShark 2 USB am/fm 
radio, and hoping to leave it &quot;stock&quot; and have it scan using 
software.  I&#x27;ve found some 3rd party software that might work, but 
don&#x27;t know the particulars of the &quot;scan&quot; function.  Anybody here gone 
this route or know of software that will work?  My portable sytem 
would be the laptop, Radio Shark 2, and a microphone-and maybe a 
Logitec external speaker.  Play white noise and radio scan thru 
speakers, record back on computer.  Whaddya think?
   Started my listening career in teh 1960&#x27;s building Knight kit 
shortwave radios, and still enjoy Shortwave listening - utilites 
mostly.  EVP seems like the next level.
Thanks
Bill</pre>
