LOL yeah if working with your original amp it by +15 in audacity then export it as a wav into denoiser which I also amp again +15 under denoiser options after i select the filter I want.
   
  That's why I said the work is just something I do for myself, not to prove anything to anyone else. I already believe so if I share, I share my excitement. I know not everyone will be able to hear it, and for the ones that are crystal clear class A there will always be someone saying its fake or a stray radio wav or whatever else they need to explain it away.
   
  Radio stations dont call me by name or address me personally...so they can think I am crazy. I dont mind. LOL
   
  As for the systems imperfection....they have taught me to rely on its imperfections. Often the surface is just as interesting as when you dive below the surface and analyze it further. I often get loud evp on regular playback without need for messing with it. But they know I record for short sessions and they make use of it by putting multilayers of messages on it. In the beginning they would all speak at once so I could hardly understand what was being said. Like being in a crowded room and everyone is talkin. So I ask them to speak one at a time and they usually do. If they speak at the same time its at another level or speed or in reverse mode so its easier to hear each one speak individually that way.
   
  Listening thru the static used to give me horrible headaches and trying to figure out how to clean them made me wanna cry LOL so they pointed me in a direction which I followed and it was a wild goose chase that resulted in the p1 filter. 
   
  Havent had a headache from it since =)
   
  That filter isnt the only settings I use but its a good start. You can also try experimenting with different background sounds like the water. And dont forget to reverse it and listen after every speed change you make.
   
  Good luck!

            okay, i finally figured it out.
  i opened it in audacity and got the "telephone" singing whatever lol and the "come" 
  i could hear those
  but i cant seem to get out anything else
  i am just estatic that i got those two words, i am on the right track WHOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
   
  a trick i forgot to do was amp them lol
  and i figured out that what it was doing was opening the orig then saving the cleaned as another file lol, took me a minute to figure that out lol
  so i just went back and amped it then went back to audacity. lol
  how complicated lol
  ofcourse everyone would like class a evp's with them speaking full sentances?! who wouldnt? but isnt this kinda the point? You cant hear them with your own ears, therefore why should you be able to hear them loud and clear on tape? ! It does happen, but i dont really care what people would say, classx is ok if it means something to me or is important or i believe. Im not einstein so it really doesnt matter if anyone else can make it out lol im not trying to change the world here <yet> lol
  im just so happy that i got those voices out myself. Thanks misty, youll never know!
   
  amy
  btw while i was cleaning this, my daughter came and told me that the water in the bathroom turned itself on and off 3 times......................hummmmm
