They do however allow you to add and amending statement.\n&gt;\n&gt; Which I have done In Big Bold Red Letters, the price listing was a\n&gt; mistake. I am certainly not trying to misrepresent the item or make a\n&gt; profit on it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have also lowered the reserve price on it as a result of the\n&gt; mistake.\n&gt; Believe me I will be taking a loss on the box.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have already sent my apologies to Rick Moran from Paranormal\n&gt; systems.\n&gt;\n&gt; And now extend my apologies for the mistake to anyone that was\n&gt; interested in it.\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason for selling the MB was not the money, it was the guilt of\n&gt; having this excellent piece of equipment go without the attention it\n&gt; deserves. And the hopes that someone or some group can utilize it\n&gt; more than myself.\n&gt;\n&gt; But I could not as much as I would have liked to, give it away.\n&gt; My intention was to get back at least a decent amount of my\n&gt; investment.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope no one gets the wrong idea and thinks ill of me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
