The cost should be minimal.\n\nMarty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot;\n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The first step should be to see if there are any sponsors \n&gt; interested.  That would take care of many of the $$$ issues.  I know \n&gt; there are some on this forum who have been involved in these type \n&gt; meetings.  I wonder if any of them would be willing to consider \n&gt; taking on this effort.\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t ask Radio Shack though...

I do believe a fee for direct  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; expenses such as meeting room, coffee, equipment rental, gas  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; expenses for the coordinator etc. is not only appropirate but  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; esential for a group meeting.  I also heartedly believe that a \n&gt; small  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fee for direct expenses is important for demonstrating \n&gt; appreciation  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of value on the part of participants.  If zero is paid, it&#39;s too  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; easy to say &quot;yes, I&#39;m in&quot; and then never show.  The money is a  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; token.  That&#39;s been my experience.  But that&#39;s just me.   ron\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
