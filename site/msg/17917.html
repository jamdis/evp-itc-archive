Ok, I put some different ones into a number system, and separate most of  
the words from sentences, see how this is, also the demon I could not 
separate  his but, I did try to clear it up plus seems he had more to say, then 
what I put  in the last time, so hear we go.  For that person who asked if I 
reverse  files, yes, I do to see if there is more on the file.  I wish I could 
have  cleared up the little demons file, it's not so easy.  Well, here 
goes.  sf
btw, some of the names in these are people I know, both living or  dead.
