Hi Zack,
 
Read my review of the Ovilus 1.  The common mistake is that everyone  turns 
it on and expects to get immediate results.  Well all that comes out  is random 
names and what some people may term "garbage" at that time.  You  have to let 
the spirits around you learn how to communicate thru the box  and this can 
take a good 30 to 60 minutes.  At that time all the randomness  will have died 
down and you can now start to communicate thru the Ovilus  1.  If this step is 
overlooked then you just sit there staring at this unit  thinking you just 
pissed away $200.00.  And that is not the case.  It  takes time for the spirits 
to learn how to communicate regardless of what device  is used.  Now if you use 
this device in the same location over and over  again you only have to do it 
once.  When I first got mine it was spewing  out all kind of random garbage 
that made sense.  But once I did this the  communication flowed fluently.  It 
even gave me the name of the little girl  who's spirit inhabits our house and 
when I called her name after hearing it this  little girl came and stood in the 
hallway looking at me in amazement.  The  best was when my cat jumped up by me 
and the Ovilus 1 and wanted attention the  Ovilus 1 said "good cat".  Then 
when my dog ran into the room and wanted my  attention over the cat the unit 
said "bad dog", LOL.  So it does work and  ask around to people who have them 
about their experiences.
 
Jeff

Hi Jeff,

Interesting. As I said, I haven't used one  yet.

I just have a lot of suspicion about devices that generate  phonemes as 
opposed to actual sounds received. I'm sure some spirits can  make them 
produce messages but they could also produce something out of  random 
sounds. That's what I'd be worried about. Might sort of come out  like 
James Joyce's Ulysses.
:-)
