Tell me where the s=

It sounds like she's saying "one, two, ....."

A=
 mistake that a lot of people make is thinking that there are two different=
 types of energy at work when it comes to sound waves and electromagnetic w=
aves. The only thing that seperates them is frequency and power. Radio wave=
s are radio waves because they occupy a certain block of the electromagniet=
ic spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same spectrum just farther down with=
 much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can penetrate almost anyt=
hing because of their wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength the more ways=
 we can shield against them.

Think of microwaves. These are also a type of=
 radio and telemetry transmitting wave but the waves also have a physical e=
ffect on our environment by causing molecules to speed up, which creates he=
at. A little lower than this is IR or infrared it too can cause physical ob=
jects to heat up but usually it just causes molecules to rotate in place. A=
ll physical things give off IR light. Its a way the total system conserves =
energy by spontaneously emitting IR radiation.

Here is some food for thought. I am currently review=

=C2=A0
It was me and another =
girl teammate=C2=A0present in the room. I picked up a 3rd female voice on m=
y digital voice recorder that I carry with me. We were standing right next =
to another digital video recorder that I leave beside my night vision camer=
a. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd voice. I have asked the girl that=
 was with me to check her recording to see if she picked it up.
=C2=A0
I ha=
ve long felt the true EVP does not come from sound waves in the environment=
, or then it wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are ap=
pearing directly on the recordings.
=C2=A0
This instance with the recorders=
 may back that theory up. That other recorder should have picked that voice=
 up if it were sound waves in the environment.
=C2=A0
I am attaching the cl=
ip of this 3rd voice. The=C2=A0file that is named=C2=A0"01-02-17 Clip" is t=
he full clip.=C2=A0You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", and then another=
 comes in right after that. I think I know what it says.
=C2=A0
Again, I wa=
s live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear this until playback. It =
isn't clear, so I am not as excited about it as my one's from the last inve=

I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an u=
ntrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It w=
orks off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that dif=
fer one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them together you =
get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sen=
ding a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an u=
ntrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference=
=C2=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). T=
his was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic =
signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP we=
re generated within a few inches of the recorder.

We are able to reproduce=
 this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with a=
coustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce calle=
d the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.

<DIV>I have a running th=
eory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly wher=
e they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you m=
ix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequency then if you ad=
d or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency=
. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an elec=
tric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will =
have a intermediate difference frequency at 9KHz, well within human he=
aring range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic e=
quipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this th=
eory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few inches of the recor=
der.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>We are able to reproduce this affect in n=
ot only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audi=
o as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio spot=
light" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.</DIV>

<DIV>I took part in an investigation of Ash=
