I looked at it in Radio Shack here in NYC\n(there are lots available around here, apparently) and it looks like you\nhave to use the up and down buttons to tune it at all. Are those the same as\nthe scan buttons, and once it is hacked, does it still work as a radio? How\ndo you tune in a specific station after it is hacked? \n\nHard to imagine one would know all the frequencies one might like to check\nout... &lt;g&gt;.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nLeslie, still newbie\n\n&quot;A hunch is creativity trying to tell you something.&quot;\n\n\t-- Frank Capra, Film Director\n\n&quot;Honor your error as a hidden intention.&quot;\n\n\t-- Brian Eno"}
