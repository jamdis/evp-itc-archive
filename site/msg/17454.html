<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There was a guy here sometime ago that used to cut out the garbage as he
called it, to bring the words or messages out. Trouble is, it was more like
he was pulling disconnected words together to form a message that he wanted.
Cut and paste.
 I get some that are different broadcast voices strung together to form a
contiguous message, but I usually don&#x27;t accept any  as having personal
meaning that have a discontinuity. When I post voices, I seperate that
segment that has the voice or phrase, I don&#x27;t try to join together segments
that might form a message, or cut out any noise, except maybe basic noise
reduction on a few--if that makes any sense.

 Maybe I misunderstand?

 This stuff is not as straight forward as most seem to think, it can be very
complicated, and there is no one right way.

&gt; I was ill on and off for the past 10 years.  However, since I have learned
&gt; about you guys, and what you have all been sharing, and with me working on
&gt; it myself, I have not been sick.  I am still really new at this, I only
&gt; started doing this since March of 09, and I&#x27;ve collected, and kept all the
&gt; raw data, plus what i tried to pull out of the files, it was harder then
&gt; because I didn&#x27;t know how to work with it I still don&#x27;t know what to do with
&gt; Goldwave, but Kristin is the one that told me about Goldwave, it is easy to
&gt; save files, and just recently I learned how to make the wav files mp3&#x27;s most
&gt; of the older files are still in Wav format.
&gt;
&gt; All  i do now, is make their words louder, and try to pull them out, from
&gt; the other voices, that get in the way.  As far as &quot;listening to negative
&gt; entities&quot; look at what goes on in this world, don&#x27;t we have enough negative
&gt; stuff to worry about already?  I just don&#x27;t enjoy encouraging them to keep
&gt; it up, feeding into the negatives only makes them stronger, and does not set
&gt; a very good example it&#x27;s like what a philosophy professor once told a
&gt; class back I took one, students could understand him, oh yes, he spoke
&gt; clearly perfect English, but the man spoke 8 languages fluently, wrote
&gt; several books;  &quot;I speak to lift this class up to my level of understanding,
&gt; so you will learn, I will not lower myself to your level, you are all here
&gt; to learn.&quot;   Difficult class?  Very much so, and no student ever managed to
&gt; get an A or B in his class one was lucky to get a C + in that class, and I
&gt; had 3.9 in all of my undergraduate work, and a 4.0 in what PhD credits I
&gt; accumulated.  But of all the science classes I took, the biology&#x27;s,
&gt; chemistry&#x27;s, theology, physics, all of them, that was by far the most
&gt; challenging ever, but boy was it interesting! sf

&gt;   Snowfire, based on your hearing of all the negative entities, do you
&gt; think listening to them could cause a person to become ill, or more
&gt; negative? If so, what do you think the symptoms of that would be?  That is,
&gt; what kind of behavior would a person exhibit who had become, perhaps
&gt; dangerously, effected?
