It&#39;s always good when the \nsweeping band boxes get in the news or on the TV and radio.\n\nIs this the prototype that sweeps the AM, and a bit above and below \nthat band?\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;April Slaughter&quot; &lt;aprilrebuilt@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Just thought I would drop in to let you all know that Dr. Ciaran\n&gt; O&#39;Keeffe has borrowed a Mini from our team (the initial prototype) and\n&gt; will be using it tonight during part of their investigation in\n&gt; Gettysburg. It is a LIVE event tonight on the Travel Channel beginning\n&gt; at 8 p.m. EST. It will be interesting to see what they catch with the\n&gt; box, if anything! :)\n&gt;"}
