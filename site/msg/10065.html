<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, i think i hear that too.  I&#x27;m probably going to just scrap this 
session, i spent 2 hours going over 45 seconds to bring out a message 
that&#x27;s so unclear to everyone else.  It&#x27;s so frustrating that the 
radio method is so flawed, i want it to be clear and it never is.  
And if i do get something that&#x27;s interesting, most people will say 
it&#x27;s just radio anyway.  That&#x27;s why i&#x27;m trying to get away from the 
radios, although it&#x27;s robotic sounding---sound soap has been the best 
so far.  Clearer and longer messages, with hardly any editing.  The 
boxes are unable to get full sentences from them and i don&#x27;t care 
what anybody else claims to get.  You will get some good &quot;yes&quot; 
and &quot;no&quot; answers, but the rest will be questioned and heard 
differently by others.  What does everyone else on this board think 
about this?
