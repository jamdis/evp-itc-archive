I believe it was Rosemary who was on C2C in December who stated she had two of your boxes.  One of them was 22 and the other was 21 or 23.  I can't remember which other one but they are consecutive numbers.

Purple Lady, or someone on a spiritual mission. I don't understand it 
completely either, but it's connected to the Catholics some how. I 
don't want to get caught up in religious dogma. 

The people with boxes were supposed to be testing them, not going off 
on ego trips, and claiming to be great mediums which was somehow 
bestowed on them by box use. There is one guy that got four, and 
claimed none worked, so that's four out of circulation. Yeah, I am a 
bit on the gullible side. There some I can't account for, like #21, I 
have no idea where it is, or if I skipped a number. A woman in San 
Diego did get a box directly from me last year, but somehow, Moon ended 
up with it. After last year, of almost non-stop box building, I just 
reached a point where I dread making them for people anymore.

Rosemary Guiley has one, Robin ( a local researcher's wife) got one in 
December for thier wedding. Woman in San Diego had one. There are women 
that are deserving of boxes, and who have waited the longest, but I 
dread giving anymore because it creates more demand. 

It's just a raido for crying out loud!
