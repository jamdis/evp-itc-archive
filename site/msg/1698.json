For that I apologize.\n\n\nWhat Rosemary was doing by &quot;imprinting&quot; the boxes was not in itself not \nincorrect, and may actually help the communcations, after all she has \nwritten several books, and is much more knowledgeable than I on things \nparanormal.  Bill seems to be an honest researcher, and he is a likeable guy \nin person.\n\nI apologize to everyone for becoming maybe too sensitive to others ideas \nabout how the boxes should be used.\n\nFrank-S\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nhttp://liveearth.msn.com"}
