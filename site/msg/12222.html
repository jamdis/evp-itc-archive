Hi Misty been a long time since we spoke.
=A0
I remember back early this ye=
ar when I first met Frank, and he too made the same comment as you, that yo=
u need not say anything.
=A0
I on the other hand could not accept this conc=
ept, but now after many of my crime case recordings, and reviewing all my q=
uestions asked, the voices told me what I needed to hear to get the right l=
eads. As soon as I turn that radio on ,they start talking about what happen=
ed, and even when i am asking them a question they are still talking. I hav=
e had to learn how to block out my questioning to hear what they said when =
I was talking.=A0
=A0
=A0I did try a recording without asking a question on=
ce, but just could not do it again as I have this in my head you need to as=
k questions.
=A0
Its hard to let go of, but you are right, they know what y=
ou need to hear.
=A0
Mike

They have made mentions of it over the year=
s including a recent statement pertaining to the contact world which I just=
 posted over on my esnips from last session. They said when the contact wor=
ld first began it was very hard, and that access was terrible. Perhaps it i=

ontact. Franks box has opened up a new avenue for those who had a hard time=
 hearing the traditional forms of evp. 

When I ask what the best method fo=

y. Or as one stated recently (also posted on esnips in water files) "I can =
telepathic, you just can't hear good telepathic" "it will always be tenuous=
". This coming after a few restless nights of being woken up to loud voices=
 speaking to me or saying my name. Also a few things going on when I was wi=
de awake and fully alert. 

I have also had some info come thru on "station=
s" and even one recording where voices I know seemed to jump from one group=
 to another as I switched methods they could be heard introducing themselve=
s to those surrounding them stating why they were barging in there to commu=
