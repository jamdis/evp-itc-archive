At the most I would \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; out $1.00 to not sell it!!!!

You could then list them just like the ones that \nare \n&gt; &gt; &gt; selling...so they pull up identical to the listings that are \nup \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there. :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; \n&lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking if someone would list a FREE DOWNLOAD of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; instructions for the various hacks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the Radio Shack units, it could put an end to the \nbusiness \n&gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sellers that are taking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of people who are unaware that they could probably \n&gt; &gt; hack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the units for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen &quot;downloads&quot; of various things listed before.
