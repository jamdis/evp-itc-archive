Frank,  
                  I think in the parallell universe there is no time, date or sex for what its worth.    They probably just consider you a supreme being thus your given name sake.  Hell I was I was thought of as loyal descent, LOL.

to tell everyone--she's pissed!!!! Way too much time in the basement,

Random in the #24 box would not work at all at the Stanley, so I' am 
abandoning that function. I know what Moon claims about the raw 
having to be random--simply not true, that was based on my 
assumptions about how the box worked in the early days of 
boxology. "> > > > Frank-S> >> >> >To: EVP-ITC@: bulletbabea@: Sun, 2

and forget what everyone else is doing. I personally know Chris and 
think he's a great guy and frank feels the same way most days. This 
has gotten to the point where i can't even do a session anymore 
because i'm so blocked by negative thoughts from this group it's 
pointless to concentrate on the box and get results. Honestly who 
cares what chris does anyway, does it really affect everyone's lives 
that much. I have a job and this is a hobby that i used to really 
like, but now this board has brought me down. It seems all people 
want to do is make this like a street fight with challenges and 
negative views and for what reason? If anyone is concerned about 
hearing Chris's audio, i have about 2 hours of box sessions from 
Eastern State on my web site for all to listen to. It's 
www.keyportparanormal.com and go to investigation and click on 
eastern state. All the audio is at the bottom of that page and you 
guys can judge for yourself and i heard a lot come out of that box 
that night personally because i repeated a lot of stuff back to chris 
that i heard. Enough already, let's move on to the next great thing. 
That radio shack hack was a great breakthrough here, let's just be 
happy we got that before it was shut down. Now we have another avenue 
to go down, but we can't do it with all these negatives out there. 
Let's move on to new topics and anyone out there that bought a Radio 
Shack box, start sharing your files with the group so it's not just 
us same 5 that post all the time.-Steve H.> >> >> >Be a better sports
