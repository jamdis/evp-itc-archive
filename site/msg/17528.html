<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Very impressive.  It sounds like the scan is flying through the channels. 

Even though it was a test session, it was very active. There is a lot of communication in there that I don&#x27;t have time to analyze right now but a few things really came across after listening to it only a couple times:  

I heard the name Jacob several times.  

You were also called out @.36 secs &quot;Hey Steven.&quot;  

Near the end, @.57, I hear the word &quot;listen&quot; said three times in a row with the last one being &quot;Listen To.&quot; followed by a &quot;It was Frank&quot; @1.00 then a &quot;thank you.&quot;

There is a woman who is very prevalent in this test and she seems to be the clearest voice of them all.  She comes across with individual words, not statements.  Starting with &quot;Jacob&quot; at .01, she can also be heard saying:

&quot;He&quot; .32
&quot;Didn&#x27;t&quot; .33 
&quot;Open&quot; .40
&quot;Let&quot; .50
&quot;Us&quot; .51

I find this clip very interesting and I love the way it sounds; I&#x27;m very impressed with this modification.  Even the cycle over of the band provides very minimal dead scan time.
