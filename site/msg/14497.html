Wow. The who won is very clear. Battle isn't too clear for me, but it would=
 make sense.

There is another thing going around-backwards speech. I don't=
 completely buy into it, but how it works is that you take anyone's speech,=
 turn it backwards, and you can get insight into what they are really think=
ing.

I don't remember where I saw it know, but whoever it was had one with=
 a little kid. They asked her if she was going to do her chores (or somethi=
ng like that). She said something like "Yes I am going to do it." When turn=
ed backwards it said "I don't want to." There were others that said basical=
ly the same thing forwards as backwards, so that meant they were telling wh=
at they believed to be the truth.

But again, I don't fully trust that it w=
asn't manipulated.

But this does seem to be what is happening here with th=
is clip.

    Riddle me this.=
.  They must be manipulating because of the reverse messages I get.  I spok=
e of this earlier in an email and I have attached an example.  Recently I d=
id a session where I hear real-time "GREAT BATTLE" .  It actually sounded l=
ike BABBLE but I recognized the word to mean battle because a clip just bef=
ore spoke of a soldier..  Anyway.. I reversed GREAT BATTLE and the word BAB=
BLE in reverse said WHO WON.  Now anyway you look at it BATTLE or BABBLE in=
 reverse when you or I say it will not come out as WHO WON.  To verify this=
 I recorded myself saying GREAT BATTLE and GREAT BABBLE three time and lowe=
ring my voice each time.  I tried to match the intonation of my clip as wel=
l.

    I was correct.  When I say BATTLE or BABBLE it in no way sounds lik=
e 'Who Won'.  It isn't even decipherable. I have attached my clip from the =
session.  I saved it as GREAT BATTLE (f) WHO WON (r).  The next - Reverse T=
est - is me saying GREAT BATTLE / BABBLE 3 times and then reversed.  

    =
This happens all the time.  Spirit is using both sides of a digital recordi=
ng and that to me infers intelligence.
