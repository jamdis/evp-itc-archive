    But if Frank does come back, I=
 hope you all can understand that you 
    are all in the same place at thi=

    He doesn't owe anyone an explanation for wh=

    with whom, and for whom. He doesn't need to be=
lieve that anyone is 
    more special than anyone or more deserving.

    =
Things *are* getting a little messianic around here, HMO. And the one 
    =
thing I can say from watching this field for 30 years is that 
    messiahs=
 come and go and never really are. What is are the little 
    glimpses of =
life after death, in other dimensions, and seemingly all 
    around us, in=
visible. That is the *only* verifiable truth of this, 
    HMO: *Something*=
 is out there and it will talk to you, if you let it. 
    Beyond that, we =
are in no way prepared to make definitive statements.

    No one should be=
 asking Frank for anything at this point. He should 
    be free to gift hi=
s boxes on whomever he feels is the one that should 
    have it--or not at=
 all.

    Before anyone jumps on me, yes, I used to ask for a box from him=
, 
    because there were no other alternatives then and because we had 
  =
  known each other on several other lists for about five years and were 
  =
  friends.

    Bu now there are alternatives--lots of them. Buy a minibox,=
 like I 
    did. If that $400 price tag is too heavy, go to Radio Shack an=
d make 
    a hack. The radio, rechargeable batteries, and an adaptor cost =
us $70.

    No one should be asking Frank for anything at this point. He s=
hould 
    be free to gift his boxes on whomever he feels is the one that s=
hould 
    have it--or on no one at all. He doesn't owe anyone anything. He=
 
    already founded this feast.

    Okay, enough out of me. I'm going to=
 go weep in my tea.
