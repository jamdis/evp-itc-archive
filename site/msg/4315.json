The ad picture is of the \nolder \n&gt; model 12-470 though, not the 12-469.  I know the Radio Shack \nwebsite \n&gt; has the same mistake; they have the two pictures mixed up. Their 12-\n469 \n&gt; page has a picture of the older 12-470 and their 12-470 page has a \n&gt; picture of th 12-469.\n&gt; That is probably where this person got the picture from, thinking \nit is \n&gt; correct.  If that in fact was a real &quot;older 12-470&quot; he was selling, \n&gt; $14.95 would be a great price since it is very hard to find any \nolde 12-\n&gt; 470 in the stores anymore.  Remember, only the older 12-470 can be \n&gt; hacked, no newer 12-470 (all black case) has been hacked yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; If someone were interested I would contact the guy and ask him to \ntake \n&gt; a picture of the box. Then you would know exactly which radio he \nhas on \n&gt; ebay for sale.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, a 12-469...now up to $6.49 plus $8.55 S/H.  ;)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@...m, &quot;judy_in_hollywood&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;Ticket_to_Heaven@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey All, Just looked in at Ebay, and found, what appears to be, \na \n&gt; 12-\n&gt; &gt; 469 radio awaiting to be Hacked by one of you!!!
