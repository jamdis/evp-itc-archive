Bruce,

No problem,=
 you are entitled to your perspective and opinion. I really don't see anywh=
ere in my post, a stance being made beside my agreeing with Sumption. Since=
 you mentioned it, I have a problem with people who consider themselves to =
be advanced researchers in ITC telling others that there are things you nee=
d protection from in this field. I have seen this fear mongering over the m=
any years I have been involved with my research and the research of colleag=
ues and associates and it has never helped anyone. Are there negative entit=
ies out there that want to influence you and distract you? Sure there are! =
Probably just as many who want to help you and they have been there since t=
he beginning of each of our lives.

The rule of thumb in dealing with those=
 negative forces is to not follow their messages. If the message is basical=
ly negative then give it no merit and carry on. No ritual needed! Now if yo=
u want credentials I can give you my "paranormal resume" and let the pissin=
g contest begin. All you need to know about me is I know enough to know tha=
t the more I learn and experience the more I realize I have a lot to learn.=
 Ego you say, not at all. 

Best regards,

Frank R.

Frank,

Let me sa=
y at the onset this is not meant as an attack and I will not 
get into a pi=
ssing match over it, but I did feel I needed to address 
it.

I promised my=
self that I would not post a response to any one 
person,only to a subject =
in general, but I will have to break that 
promise on this one.

I think yo=
ur response to the ritual protection post was egotistical, 
careless and un=
informed. That was the response I would expect from a 
close minded sceptic=
 that had no real experience in this field.

As a researcher in the paranor=
mal in general you should know that 
there is a very real and present dange=
r from darker entities, 
especially in the field of box research that is st=
ill in its infancy 
and our knowledge is not advanced enough using this met=
hod to be so 
hap hazard about it.

All are entitled to their own opinion a=
s far as the way they go about 
their own research but to advise that prote=
ction from the negative 
means nothing and to do it in an open forum where =
there are 
impressionable new individuals that are just entering into this =

research is very careless on your part.

Some researchers here including S=
teve and myself among other have 
recorded files with messages that tell us=
 that the communication 
process is being hindered at that time by what we =
refer to as 
"dark heads" and our spirit contacts actually use that term. t=
hey 
have also told us when asked why communication was so bad that it was =

being blocked by negative entities. 

I only one of a few that have gotten=
 this exact communication. So 
there is a real threat from negative energy =
or entities.

Plus through research we have found that it is possible for e=
ntities 
to travel back and forth between our realms during an open box 
se=
ssion. If you listened to numerous files Steve and I have posted 
asking ou=
r friends mike and Lisa on the other side to insure that all 
and any spiri=
ts that may have traveled through please go back and 
have gotten conformat=
ion from them every time.

If it is possible for an entity to travel throug=
h the portal that a 
box MAY produce then it stands to reason it is possibl=
e that it can 
be a dark entity.

As far as fear goes, I agree wholehearted=
ly, fear definitely feeds 
the negative. And that is my point. The protecti=
on ritual does not 
create a relative tangible barrier, it is simply a meta=
phoric symbol 
of putting your mind in the right place so as not to feed th=
is 
negative energy.

And the protection we receive from our tech/guides on=
 the other side 
in my belief is very real, I believe they do actually run =

interference for us as far as negativity goes and the part of the 
ritual =
where we invoke their help is just a form of respect and 
acknowledgement t=
hat they are constantly watching out for us.

this being said, Of course ev=
eryone will adhere to their own beliefs 
as far as this subject is concerne=
d. I just felt that your response 
was a little strong and came more from t=
he attitude that I also 
suffer from that is to say " negative spirit yeah =
bring it on"

But that is not a logical thought out approach to an existing=
 concern.
So make the ritual available for anyone that wants to use it and =
the 
experienced information to go with it.

My most important concern is t=
he welfare and teaching and eventual 
success of new researcher and this re=
search as a whole.
