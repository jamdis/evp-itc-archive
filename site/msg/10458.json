I know I am a 3 time cancer \nsurvior. So, hang in there and stay positive, I know its hard. But, \nwere all here for ya. again welcome!\nBlessings,\nLK\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Wes Kellington&quot; &lt;kq4ok@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, my name is Wes Kellington, and I am from Waynesboro, VA.  This \nis my\n&gt; second post since joining the group\n&gt; on March 1.\n&gt; \n&gt; I came here specifically to listen and learn from Frank Sumption \nand to\n&gt; likeminded individuals.  I am a ham radio operator,\n&gt; although I have not been active in years since the CB&#39;ers kind of \ntook over\n&gt; with their new no-code rules, and am a\n&gt; computer technician.  I have been passionately pursuing paranormal \ninterests\n&gt; since I was a child.  So, Frank, please\n&gt; keep on supplying us with your knowledge and foresight.  I look \nforward to\n&gt; your posts; and I read all of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I read all the posts, even by the guy with the gall to ask for \nsomeone to\n&gt; send him a radio.  Yes, I would give anything\n&gt; to have one; but I would not dare ask someone to do that for me.  \nThat&#39;s\n&gt; just wrong!  And as far as threatening\n&gt; personal emails, what the Hell has been the matter with people?  My \nwife is\n&gt; the business manager of a local\n&gt; psychiatric practice.  The day of the full moon, they had more \npatients and\n&gt; admitted more people to the psychiatric\n&gt; wing of the hospital than ever!\n&gt; \n&gt; This is off-topic.  I have been dealing with a personal problem for \nthe past\n&gt; several weeks.  I had a chest X-ray; and\n&gt; on it they found a 2.5 cm nodule in one of my lungs.  My catscan is \nMay 8th\n&gt; to make sure I do not have lung cancer.\n&gt; The waiting is killing me.  It&#39;s like being on death row and \nwaiting to see\n&gt; if the phone rings.  So, I have not had the\n&gt; energy to do anything lately.  I am only waiting...\n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully, there will be a positive outcome, and then I can delve \ninto this\n&gt; further and begin some research of my own.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank, please stick around.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wes\n&gt;"}
