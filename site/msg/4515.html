<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I usually only ask if there are any messages with EVPmaker, and wiht 
other methods I only announce I am doing an EVP recording. I 
generally get meaningful messages, and phrases. i count on my giudes 
to give me what I need, and say waht they wish. Also, all entites are 
welcome to speak, good or bad. It takes both make the universe. 
Curiouly EVPmaker works best at work. (everyone wishes they had my 
job!).

&gt; Twos questions for you Frank.  On these EVPs, were you asking 
questions to get those messages?  If not, do the messages have any 
meaning to you?  ron l
