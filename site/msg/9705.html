now if anyone can actually hear it besides me it would be nice ...

I have =
been trying to get clarity about the number 7 and today's
message was unusu=
al.

I asked them what the number 7 meant to them and in reply I heard:
DON=
T FAKE...  THE FIRST SON...  SHIVA JUSTICE...  THE SPIRIT (or could
be DESP=
ERATE).. THAT'S ALL.

I know what the first son probably refers to.. and I =
have heard of
Shiva but never 'Shiva Justice'.. so I looked that up and thi=
s is what
I found in reference to the definition of Shiva Justice:

from:  =
http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Siva_Shiva/id/137936

Siva, Shiva (Sans=
krit) The third god of the Hindu Trimurti (trinity):
Brahma the evolver; Vi=
shnu the preserver; and Siva the regenerator or
destroyer.

Siva is one of =
the three loftiest divinities of our solar system, and
in his character of =
destroyer stands higher than Vishnu for he is "the
destroying deity, evolut=
ion and PROGRESS personified, who is the
regenerator at the same time; who =
destroys things under one form but
to recall them to life under another mor=
e perfect type" (SD 2:182).

As the destroyer of outward forms he is called=
 Vamadeva.  Endowed with
so
many powers and attributes, Siva possesses a gr=
eat number of names,
and is represented under a corresponding variety of fo=
rms. He
corresponds to the Palestinian Ba`al or Moloch, Saturn, the Phoenic=
ian
El, the Egyptian Seth, and the Biblical Chiun of Amos, and Greek Typhon=
.

Siva is known under more than a thousand names or titles and is
represen=
ted under many different forms in Hindu writings. As the god
of generation =
and of justice, he is represented riding a white bull;
his own color, as we=
ll as that of the bull, is generally white,
referring probably to the unsul=
lied purity of abstract justice. He is
sometimes seen with two hands, somet=
imes with four, eight, or ten; and
with five faces, representing among othe=
r things his power over the
five elements.

"In the Rig Veda the name Siva =
is unknown, but the god is called
Rudra, which is a word used for Agni, the=
 fire god . . ."; "In the
Vedas he is the divine Ego aspiring to return to =
its pure, deific
state, and at the same time that divine ego imprisoned in =
earthly
form, whose fierce passions make of him the 'roarer,' the 'terrible=
' "
(SD 2:613, 548).

Siva is often spoken of as the patron deity of esoter=
icists,
occultists, and ascetics; he is called the Mahayogin (the great
asc=
etic), from whom the highest spiritual knowledge is acquired, and
union wit=
h the great spirit of the universe is eventually gained. Here
he is "the ho=
wling and terrific destroyer of human passions and
physical senses, which a=
re ever in the way of the development of the
higher spiritual perceptions a=
nd the growth of the inner eternal man
-- mystically . . . Siva-Rudra is th=
e Destroyer, as Vishnu is the
preserver; and both are the regenerators of s=
piritual as well as of
physical nature. To live as a plant, the seed must d=
ie. To live as a
conscious entity in the Eternity, the passions and senses =
of man must
first die before his body does. 'To live is to die and to die i=
s to
live,' has been too little understood in the West. Siva, the
destroyer=
, is the creator and the Saviour of Spiritual man, as he is
the good garden=
er of nature. He weeds out the plants, human and
cosmic, and kills the pass=
ions of the physical, to call to life the
perceptions of the spiritual, man=
" (SD 1:459&n).
