Maybe crutch was a poor choice of words on my \npart, but we all have opinions and so far no one is right. Remember, \nwe both have the same techs??  So, i figured to turn it on and ask \nwho wants to speak with me and give others a chance to speak.  Mike \nand Lisa still come through every session in their same voice just to \nlet me know they are there if i need them.  Besides i feel that they \nmust be busy getting loaned out to everybody.  My communication has \nescalated to a better level recently and i know we have worked \ntogether in the past, but we haven&#39;t in about a month and a half so \ndon&#39;t tell others on here how i do box sessions.  You really don&#39;t \nknow what i&#39;m doing and would only give new researchers bad \ninformation.  Although we should all work together at this, we all \nhave different methods and that&#39;s what keep us tuned in to this \nmessage board every day.  Bruce, this is not an argument from me at \nall and i do respect what you do.  We just do things very differently \nnow and that&#39;s why we no longer do research together, but a different \npoint of view is also good sometimes.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Robin,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I agree with Steve on a couple of points. First let me say that I\n&gt; do believe that we all have a &quot;technician/guide/guardian&quot; call them \nwhat you\n&gt; may. but I usually call them by the names they introduced \nthemselves by.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I know for a fact through many, many, many box sessions that when I \nturn\n&gt; a box on, could be Frank&#39;s box or the minibox or the RS 470 does \nnot matter which.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The same two entities will come through immediately, So much so \nnow, that I do not even ask for conformation that\n&gt; it is in fact them. I recognise their individual voice patterns. I \nhave built a solid relationship with these two spirits\n&gt; I know as mike and Lisa so much so that I have even gotten to know \ntheir individual personalities.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There are other newer researchers here that will attest to the fact \nthat when they where doing their first sessions\n&gt; I had asked my two &quot;Friends&quot; Mike and Lisa to assist in getting \nthem started and invariably the spirits that came \n&gt; through to these new researchers during their first sessions \nidentified themselves as Mike and Lisa.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Steve says he does not turn on his box and use them as a crutch, \nthat is not entirely true. I had done research \n&gt; very closely with Steve until recently and I would venture to say \nthat 99% if not every session he starts with &quot;Mike & Lisa\n&gt; are you available to talk with me&quot; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Also I don&#39;t consider working with my technicians as using them as \na crutch, They would not allow that.\n&gt; They are not there like butlers at our beckoned call when we feel \nthey may be of some use.\n&gt; Quite the opposite, without them we would get no communication at \nall, they are allowing us the honor of receiving this \n&gt; celestial communication. They are the moderators, facilitators and \ngenerators of all we hear and send to and from the spirit realm.\n&gt; And they also stand as guards and protectors to do the best they \ncan to keep us from being deceived or taken down a dark path.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Some here wait for others to state an opinion and then tend to \nagree with that opinion no matter what they have experienced to be \ntrue.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Robin, my advice to you as a new researcher in this field. Form \nyour own beliefs through your experience and research.\n&gt; Listen and learn from others but do not let what you believe to be \ntrue or not, be swayed by popular opinion.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: MudPuddleFarm@...: Sat, 2 Feb 2008 21:42:09 -\n0800Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: File from tonight\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Steve,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I certainly appreciate your thoughts.  In the back of my mind is \nalways the question of whether we are being Deceived.  Just for the \nsake of argument, is it POSSIBLE we&#39;re being manipulated by something \nevil?  I&#39;m not frightened, and I won&#39;t stop my own research (the \nnegative stuff just makes me more determined), but my mind does go \nthere sometimes.  I hope that along with developing my &quot;ear&quot; I can \nacquire the gift of discernment.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Robin\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: Steve Hultay \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Saturday, February 02, 2008 8:57 PM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: File from tonight:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Robin,If i may add my thoughts on this: There is no concrete \nevidence of who or what comes through is what they say they are. \nTechnicians i have found were used to get you up and running and i \nonly now call on them if i need assistance. I don&#39;t turn the boxes on \nand ask for them like a crutch, i conduct my session and if i need \nhelp they will supply it to me if needed. I think the whole idea is \nto find out who we are communicating with, maybe we will never really \nknow for sure but i still try and find out as best as i can. -Steve \nH.--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robin Searcy Henson&quot; \n&lt;MudPuddleFarm@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Hi Frank, &gt; &gt; When you mention being \ndistrustful of what comes through the boxes, are you saying you&#39;re \nskeptical of the &quot;technicians&quot; being who they say they are? Not \ntrying to open another can of worms here, just wanting to continue \nlearning from your experience and research. I get what you&#39;re saying \nabout becoming obsessive with the sessions. I&#39;ve probably asked you \nthis a half dozen times over the last couple of years, but who or \nwhat do YOU think you&#39;re/we&#39;re communicating with?&gt; &gt; Robin&gt; &gt; &gt; -----\n Original Message ----- &gt; From: \npurplespacefriend&lt;mailto:purplealiengirl@&gt; &gt; To: EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, \nFebruary 02, 2008 7:46 PM&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: File from tonight&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Have ya tried EVPmaker? It is based on that random principle, and \n&gt; predates the boxes.&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve heard this stuff before, about random \nbeing the best, and I &gt; have to disaggree. I also think it unwise to \nspend every waking &gt; moment doing sessions. I think it creates that \nexpectation, and &gt; perhaps desperation to make contact, and I would \ntend not to trust &gt; what comes through. &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t trust some of \nthis stuff because I have yet get any &gt; meaningful assistence with \nthe boxes from the so called technicians. &gt; All I ever got was a \ntelepathic &quot;suggestion&quot; to use the echo boxes. &gt; Everything else was \na assemblage of stuff I had worked on in hte past &gt; to solve the \nproblem of &quot;what else could I use&quot;. &gt; &gt; I hate to see yet another go \ndown the road of &quot;this is the onlyest &gt; way&quot;. &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Shed those extra pounds with MSN and The Biggest Loser!\n&gt; http://biggestloser.msn.com/\n&gt;"}
