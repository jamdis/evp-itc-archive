<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There doesn&#x27;t appear to be much to it. He uses a compass inside a box as the
indicator for possible paranormal events and has electronics to detect when
the compass needle moves. He also has an IR sensor and it&#x27;s not clear to me
if it just senses changes in an IR field or if it uses IR to detect if the
compas needle moved.

There&#x27;s no audio involved in it. My guess is that my Trifield meter does the
same thing basically but costs more and is less subject to false
triggerings.

&gt; Does anyone know what Ed&#x27;s box is or anything about it? A friend of mine
&gt; told me a little about it. I think they saw it on an episode of American
&gt; Ghost Hunters. Does anyone know anything? Is it good or junk?
