I receieved a \ncease-and-desist notice from Radio Shack many years ago when I was \nmodifying their radio scanner products and posting them on the web.  \nGuess what... if you go to scanshack.com you can still see step-by-\nstep instructions on how I modified their scanners, with detailed \ndrawings I did.\nThey (RS/Tandy at that time) lost that battle with me, or I should \nsay their lawyer lost that battle with me.\nBut, as you said... we shall wait and see what is up with this issue.\n- Mike\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Judy, and everyone else, too--please don&#39;t promote or continue \nthis  \n&gt; until we hear from Sum. This may not be what everyone is assuming \nat  \n&gt; all. My concern is that he has received a cease-and-desist notice  \n&gt; from Radio Shack, which may have been informed that someone was  \n&gt; promoting their product in a way not in compliment with their  \n&gt; corporate image, and that his counsel is advising he comply with \nit.  \n&gt; What you are telling people to do may be exactly what his own \nlegal  \n&gt; counsel is advising against and may put him in a precarious \nsituation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please just calm down and don&#39;t make assumption until he can \nclarify  \n&gt; for us. If it comes down to someone making personal threats \nagainst  \n&gt; him, that&#39;s a whole other matter. But he needs to ask for help \nbefore  \n&gt; everyone goes all posse, OK?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Dec 1, 2007, at 11:53 PM, judy_in_hollywood wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi all, I sent George an email about our group here (to look in) \n+  \n&gt; &gt; about the RS 12-469 AM/FM digital radio modification - for his  \n&gt; &gt; awareness!
