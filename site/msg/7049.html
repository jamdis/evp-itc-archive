Hi LC   Couldn't agree with you more.  In fact, I believe research is being performed on us by the other side.  If not research then certainly a test.  
   
  I think back to a required reading in Lit I class many years ago.  Castaneda...Don Juan, On Optimism I believe it was titled.  The scene had Don Juan, a Shaman, working at a gas station pumping gas (remember those days), and a car pulls up filled with nuns, preachers, "holy" folks.  Don Juan then went into a some sort of verbally profane and abusive fit directed at the supposed holy ones.  Their "cover" was immediately stripped.  Their reaction very normal, very human, certainly NOT holy.   Maybe we are not as holy as we think.  
   
  I believe we all learn from the research being done here on us and I believe the testing and research done here by us is of value.  I also believe that all personality types are needed and all types should be invited and welcomed...lol RL

          Steve, here are my thoughts.

I understand your post clearly, but would also suggest that people 
here have different roles in this...myself included.

Though I hold in high regard Mr. F.S., you, and the many others here, 
I wonder if the individual roles vary for whatever purpose, be it 
greater or not. Maybe some people are to conceive ideas, others to 
build, some to find other ways to communicate, still more to be 
talented in gleaning messages, while another group may have a use for 
the device with ghosts, still another with enlightened spirits, 
another with ETs, etc. I could really conceive of even much more 
examples than this.

That said, just maybe this forum is best expressed as a potpourri of 
ideas, methods, roles, capabilities and more, all for the common 
good. In being such a place, those who need to hear the technical 
will hear the technical; those who need to hear the spiritual, the 
spiritual, etc, etc. Can any one man's ideas/experiences really be 
the "only truth" for whatever this device's purposes are?

In that spirit, the term "research" may have a different definition 
to each person. To some it is scientific, to others, it may not be. 
Are all here researchers? I would suppose that's most probably not 
the case. Does that make those here who are not researchers without 
value to the common good/goal, whatever that may be? I would think 
that none of us can judge that, but what we can judge is whether or 
not chatting with one another should be respectful or not. I support 
all being kind to all, I guess, and not thinking that others might 
not have a role in this thing. ;)
