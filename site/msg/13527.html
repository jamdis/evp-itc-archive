&gt; I personally have not used this device, but a close friend and fellow investigator just purchased one. She has used it only a few times but the results were encourageing. On her first recorded session, when asking &quot;why are you here&quot;, the reply that she recieved certainly seemed relevant. The Ovilus stated &quot; fell running down stairs, broken neck&quot;. Another interesting response from the recording was in reply to the question &quot;who are you?&quot; The response from the Ovilus was &quot;ghost&quot;. However, she alsorecieved responses that did not seem relevant to the questions she was asking at the time.She sends me all of her recordings for review so I will keep you posted on the results. Personally, I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on one to try it out for myself.
