<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Michelle,

Sounds like ghosts/spirits manipulating the radio to me.

Your experience with the &quot;locking on&quot; has also happened to me when I 
had a strong (angry), male ghost messing with the device during a 
home that was having a high level of activity (2 male earthbound 
apparitions).

The messages that I was able to record when it was happening 
were, &quot;Stop that music,&quot; (it locked repeatedly on a a rock song, &quot;I&#x27;m 
the man of the house&quot; LOL Go figure!), and the message, &quot;Please, son 
of a bitch, leave.&quot;  

Both audio recordings are in the LC&#x27;s folder here.  :)

&gt; Hello All, 
&gt; Long time lurker here, got a question.
&gt; I got the radio shack rs 469, did the hack and was having a tough 
time
&gt; finding a speaker like the UFO geek uses for his box. I found a
&gt; battery powered unit and now am experiencing the clicking sounds. 
Can
&gt; anyone tell me where to find the small single speaker that was shown
&gt; in the UFO Geeks hack? I think the batteries are causing the 
clicking.
&gt; Oh also. I attempted to use the radio in a very active cemetary and
&gt; the radio immediately locked on the am station 66. There was no 
sounds
&gt; coming from it and each time I set it to search it would go back and
&gt; lock. Did I have a hit from the other side and was too green to see 
that?
&gt; Thanks for any and all input, would love to get this equipment going
&gt; in the right direction as I keep getting signs of visitations and I
&gt; feel as if I is my grandma trying to communicate with me.
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Michelle
