<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I checked out all the pics. I see faces in there, as
for the cat one nope i dont see a cat but it is
&quot;somethin&quot; I was more interested in the bearded man
over to the far left of the image. I get alot of the
&quot;somethins&quot; + bearded man in the same pics. I usually
just say alien looking guy and bearded man hehehe

The dual/stretched face images are also similar to
some of the ones ive gotten over the years. 

I just added some new ones to the New gallery myself.
I used ratkas imnage of his laser board and video
recorded it then rerecorded the video i had just
recorded using it as raw footage for the light source.
Had a few good ones pop up. I dont care what the
ghosthunters or even what other researchers here think
of my methods. I am more interested in learning more
and expanding my mind than proving any of this is
real.

If they want to talk about whats real or whats not
real I always just jump to the &quot;what if you are all
just a figment of my own imagination and vice versa&quot;
when they can find the proof for either side of that
battle then we will discuss it more. hehehe 

Good stuff keep at it. Glad to see your having a go at
video again tho I think we may need to update you and
get you a webcam to make it easier on ya on the video
end.
