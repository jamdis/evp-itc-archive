  File        : /Jim&#x27;s RR-DR60 EVP&#x27;s/BLESS_YOU-Original Audio-evp.wav 
  Uploaded by : clockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt; 
  Description : Went with a friend and his wife out to 90 miles away from our home town to get a Boxer Pup from a Group that retrieved the pup (and others) from a puppy mill.  On our way back we stopped at a Truck Stop so some could use the restroom.            I went over to the picnic tables and then soon walked up to a big rock while recording for possible EVP&#x27;s. I didn&#x27;t think I would have much luck.
