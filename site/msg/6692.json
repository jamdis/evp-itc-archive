They are the Session 6 files.\n A couple of them kind of creeped me out a bit.  The one that I think\nsays &quot;Kaleb needs something&quot; has been slowed down.  It freaked me out\na bit because Kaleb is my son. So of course, when I heard it I\nimmediately went to check on him.  Fortunately everything is just\nfine. Let me know what you think.  \n\n\nhttp://www.esnips.com/web/JeremysEVP-ITCFiles\n\nJeremy"}
