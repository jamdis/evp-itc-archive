This is was very clear and attached  \nto a direct real-time response from me, so I thought I&#39;d post it.  \nIt&#39;s the first swearing I&#39;ve had since around my second session. All  \nthe other swearing posted previously came from that one.\n\nAt time I heard this one (and by the way, its slowed by about half),  \nI assumed that the voice was talking to me, but it actually comes  \njust after what sounds like some kind of ruined attempt at  \ncommunication. I wonder if this is one of the technicians telling  \nsomeone off. The &quot;Let go&quot; part is very interesting. Let go of what?\n\nAnn\n\nOn Jan 23, 2008, at 3:51 PM, juli velazquez wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Anne, Who&#39;s cat did you kick on the other side?
