  Please don't laugh. I tried to clean it up using wavepad, but their 
was this annoying ringing sound I tried to get out of it. I got all of 
this message when the radio shack hack was scanning the band, and it 
all in a row no cut and pasteing or taking out garbage. I will remove 
this pretty quick because its embarassing, so you might want to listen 
to only a few seconds in it. It might be anonying lol I will post the 
original if anybody is interested.
