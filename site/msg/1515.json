I replaced the capacitors in the whithe noise amp \nthat control the gain, and voila--kick butt box. This is one of two that I \ntried &quot;ugly construction&quot;, where the components are mounted on an unetched \npiece of copper clad board in an effort to reduce size. One drawback with \nthis box is it&#39;s AC powered, so not portable to places wihtout power--like \ngrave yards, so I might convert it.  I have one more of these, #12, but the \ntuner needs to be replaced.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDon&#39;t get caught with egg on your face.
