They \nare the caps on the reference resistors on the gain stages for the white \nnoise and the amp after the first low pass filter. The caps that go to the \nnegative supply voltage, those have to be large, at least 100uf aluminum, or \n47uf tantalums, the tantalum caps are the best. With 10uf capacitors as \nshown on current vesions of the schematics, there is just not enough gain \nfor the low frequency signals that are developed into the random tuning \nvoltage. Even using 10uf tantalum capacitors is not enough. I&#39;m making a \nboard now with all tantalum capacitors. I get my tantalum caps from old hard \ndrives, and other computer related boards, so I can afford to experiment. \nUse at least 20 volt rated capacitors.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nTalk now to your Hotmail contacts with Windows Live Messenger. \nhttp://get.live.com/messenger/overview\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_2b6a_2d7b_76bd\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;1-Ahhh-It&#39;sOnFire(R)---What&#39;RYaLookin&#39;At--Witness.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;1-Ahhh-It&#39;sOnFire(R)---What&#39;RYaLookin&#39;At--Witness.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_2b6a_2d7b_76bd\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;4--Time--CandiSaysIMeanIt-(R)-IKnewYou&#39;dCopy---Now.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;4--Time--CandiSaysIMeanIt-(R)-IKnewYou&#39;dCopy---Now.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_2b6a_2d7b_76bd\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;6-We&#39;reTestin&#39;ForSumption-EQ.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;6-We&#39;reTestin&#39;ForSumption-EQ.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_2b6a_2d7b_76bd\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;7-We&#39;reHelpin&#39;-ThisIsGood.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;7-We&#39;reHelpin&#39;-ThisIsGood.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_2b6a_2d7b_76bd\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;8-There&#39;sANuke-Witness (3).mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;8-There&#39;sANuke-Witness (3).mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_2b6a_2d7b_76bd\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;14-I&#39;mTryingToUnderstandMilatary.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;14-I&#39;mTryingToUnderstandMilatary.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_2b6a_2d7b_76bd\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;1-Chyrnoble&#39;sComin&#39;Up-ThousandsSick--.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;1-Chyrnoble&#39;sComin&#39;Up-ThousandsSick--.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_2b6a_2d7b_76bd--"}
