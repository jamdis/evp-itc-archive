Let me suggest that you take a look at other alternatives that will allow you to begin doing &lt;SPAN&gt;evp&lt;/SPAN&gt; recordings yourself in a blink of the eye and with less than $50 invested.&nbsp; You can also explore a couple sites where good equipment is available to buy off the shelf that will give evp results.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&nbsp;is stuff you might find useful.&nbsp; You can always build your own as you move along in the process.&nbsp; I am glad you are with us.&nbsp; I have some technical questions you might be able to help research...like learning about the frequencies of &quot;their&quot; transmission etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; but I ll save that.&nbsp;
