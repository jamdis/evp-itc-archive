I have 2 of them\nand tried over the weekend to utilize them in an investigation. The\nexposure time on these things is like 30 seconds. It&#39;s such a pain in\nthe butt. If you do use the 35mm, what kind of settings do you use?\nAny advice? I am totally new to night photography. Has everyone gone\nto digital now or what?\n\nChad"}
