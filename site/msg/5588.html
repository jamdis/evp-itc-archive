<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>OMG there is no Al or Patti living in this house nor have I found 
anyone by that name who has ever lived in the house. Hmmmmmm odd but 
then it is an EVP thank you so much.

&gt; Here&#x27;s what i got from the 2min. one  Traditional EVP is a bit 
rough  for me, 
&gt; but at the end i believe it says &quot;Al give it to Patti&quot;.  I slowed  
it up and 
&gt; raised the volume a bit.

&gt; Hello all, I am new to the group and I have uploaded an EVP file I 
made  
&gt; with my new Digital Voice recorder in my bedroom this morning. I 
had a  
&gt; really kick butt one that I sent to TAPs. A little girl, clear as 
a  
&gt; bell but there was nothing I could do with it. Hopefully TAPs can 
do  
&gt; something with it.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, the file I put up, if you listen REALLY  close when I ask a 
&gt; question there are tiny bell sounds right after the  question. I 
have 
&gt; another almost 10 minute EVP where I left the recorder in  the 
room, no 
&gt; windows or doors open and when I went in to turn it off there  was 
a 
&gt; very strong scent of old fashioned tea rose.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone could  bump up the 2nd one to see what the low voices are 
&gt; saying that would be  great, drop me an e-mail. I am a sensitive 
but 
&gt; would love to learn how to  also use some equiptment to help me out.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you
