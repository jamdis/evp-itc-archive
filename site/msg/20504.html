I don't believe Bruce ever listened to loud music.  Being in a band  and 
=
musician is where i get the good ear to hear the communication.
 
If i can'=
t hear anything at all in a file, it's NOT there !  I think  some 
are just=
 trying to be nice.  
 
You just mentioned Ursula as one of the people that=
 can hear your files,  
but in the previous post Ursula said that she can't=
 hear anything in your  
files.
 
I've tried to help you with editing, but =
you don't want it.

Question:

I don't =
hear most of the files you post, but you  hear them so clearly. The 
only w=
ay to validate what you hear is true, would  be to follow up with 
somethin=
g that you got that actually  happened.

Have you ever heard a message th_a=
t came true that nobody  else heard, 
basically validating your experience?=
