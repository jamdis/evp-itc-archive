I am also going to try the white noise via a a to d\nconverter.  If the clock pulse is fast enough the white noise should\nbe close to true random even after an a to d converter.\nRob.\nDead Science.\n- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  My Speakjet test board, using a zif (zero insertion force) socket,\njumpers for various modes, and audio amplifiers.

I haven&#39;t read enough of the manual yet about the\ndata, if it needs to be in a certain form or what. Is it just bits, or\nis it bytes?
