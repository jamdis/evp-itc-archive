This is gonna sound obsurd! I have NEVER looked in my entire life at 
any of my photos for orbs etc. I finally pulled out a few CD's of film 
and its amazing i never saw what is on these pictures. There are orbs on 
alot of them, there is series of pictures that have HUGE STREAM of 
light, but in the last one its NOT there. Is it just the sun or other? 
Considering that the ray is blinding in the other photos. Another AMAZING 
aspect, is this "streak" its grey and running a couple inches. I thought 
it was a fluke until in ANOTHER roll of film it is there too! I am so 
stupid that i never noticed any of this ! <My keen ability to tun out 
whats around me>
  I am going to pull out all my photo albums tonight and go through 
them all!
  Feel free to comment on the pics, what your thgouhts are
