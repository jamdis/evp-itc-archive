If I understand correctly, \nyou are using an older 12-470 with a mic in front of it recording you \nand the built-in speaker, correct?  Your earlier recordings sounded \nlike a studio mic or something - very nice.\n\nI have been playing with the Listen Up mic into the recorder, as well \nas a lapel mic.  You seem to have less static...I am going to go \nlisten to your latest uploads and let you know what I think.\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; hey guy&#39;s \n&gt; \n&gt; I just posted a bunch of new file to folder RS 470 12-18-07 in the \n&gt; files section.\n&gt; \n&gt; have a listen and please leave some feedback.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;"}
