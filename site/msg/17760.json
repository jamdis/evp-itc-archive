I have used all\nkinds of stuff for the chamber, 12 inch X 4 foot long MDF board chamber,\naluminum foil in a 1/4 inch wood frame, metal channels formed by gluing in\nmetal strips. In box #1, I used a triangle shaped cany tin, and hte main\nboard for the box was mounted on top.\n\n The mic feed the fourth op amp channel of the sweep generator, where it&#39;s\namplified and forms the line out signal, and then drives the monitor/panel\nspeaker. The electret mic has to be biased to work, if you buy one at RS I\nthink the paskage shows the details. it gets a little complicated.\n\n Frank-S\n\nOn Sun, Jun 20, 2010 at 6:49 AM, &lt;dc3644@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So how is the mic positioned?
