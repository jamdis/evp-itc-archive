<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, we&#x27;ll see if number 31 can hold a candle to mini 114. ;) Frank  
says that 31 is about the size of a mini, and that&#x27;s good, because I  
haven&#x27;t got a lot of space to experiment in.

We&#x27;re all quite excited here--my son, Julie Stoddard, and I. And of  
course, I am really happy that Frank has vetted and approved me to  
adopt one of his babies. (I think the Purples made him do it; they&#x27;ve  
always been sweet on me, right from the start. ;) )

Thanks for always cheering me on, Bruce. You&#x27;re the toppermost.
