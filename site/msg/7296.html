&gt;  Hard to hear in the cell phone video, but just had time to do a 
quickie demo before having to run to work. Thought I might as well 
keep posting the information so it can be ripped off by the ones 
selling their stufff, and they can say how flawed my stuff is. I 
really don&#x27;t mind others taking the ideas and making improvements, 
changes, and making a profit, but ya don&#x27;t have to beat me up in the 
process.  See the current TAPs paramag for the curious. I heard about 
it through someone that gets the mag, but don&#x27;t know anything first 
hand. I don&#x27;t care that much to spend money to get magazine. 
Paranormal=Hollywood=$$$.

&gt;  I am well aware of the short comings of my equipment, I&#x27;m just 
honest enough not to sell it till it&#x27;s perfected. I&#x27;m not an 
engineer, just a hillbilly techno droid trying satisfy her own 
curiousity.
