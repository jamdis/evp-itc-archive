<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce,

sometimes I can hear realtime messages too, but usually I have to listen
to the recording afterwards to be sure of what I actually heard.

&quot;I&#x27;m here, I can&quot; is pretty clear.

&quot;The[y] are all here&quot; is really amazing as a direct answer to your
question.

&quot;We can offer better base&quot; isn&#x27;t audible by me.

Instead of &quot;Do not fear&quot;, I hear &quot;You not here/hear&quot;; the second part
&quot;i&#x27;ll be here&quot; sounds very clear to me.

&quot;it will upset you for two years_i&#x27;m just arthur&quot; is mostly clear to me.

&quot;Hopefully you get this before you yell at us&quot; is a clear one - and a
funny one. :)

&quot;they&#x27;re here&quot;, &quot;not yet&quot;, and &quot;hey Bruce&quot; are short but clear.

Congratulations, I&#x27;m impressed - especially by your ability to
often receive direct answers to your questions in realtime.

May I suggest to you that you refrain from increasing the volume of only
a part of the recording, since it&#x27;s disturbing, and it influences the
listener? :)

Stefan

&gt; Stefan,

&gt; I just did a 2 minute experiment with the file you posted and EVPM.
&gt; During the session I heard several real time answers and have gotten 
&gt; about 30 seconds into the recording and have extracted 3 fantastic 
&gt; concise files with direct answers to questions.

&gt; I am posting the three files now, with more to come later.
&gt; Please e-mail me with an explination on the program, &quot;speakjet&quot;
&gt; my e-mail is 

&gt; paranormalinvestigating@...

&gt; I appreciate it.

&gt; Bruce</pre>
