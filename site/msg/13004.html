<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I wasn&#x27;t as obsessed with B as I was in finding the truth out about 
things. Think about it.... after she left I still continued right? I 
havent looked for her and have moved on with another too, but the 
questions still haunted me. The spystuff was the only way to prove to 
her and myself even, that someone(now I see its something)was there. 
That stuff really seems to bother you doesn&#x27;t it? Well, I sat down 
with her several times and showed her what was gathered and why I was 
drawing these conclusions. Still she couldnt understand or explain 
them and that fed my mission to continue. After she heard the same 
things as me and still couldn&#x27;t explain how they got there, I was 
convinced she was lying and acting.  

I think your right about that, but I havent fed into the way they 
were trying to communicate with me anymore, especially after I found 
out the truth. 

I asked for help and suggestions your right, negativity I have enough 
of right now. If thats your form of help and suggestion then I am 
letting you know its not needed from me, so carry on. 

However, I respect your mindset in thinking that honesty is what I 
need, because it is usually all I ask for and thats what I am here 
for. I simply think you just jump the gun too quick and I thank 
Suzanne for pointing out that I was merely just trying to be honest 
and paint the whole picture of the feelings and energies associated 
with this situation.

&gt; It sounds like you&#x27;re way to obsessed with B - meaning you spend 
way  
&gt; too much time trying to control &amp; thinking about her.
&gt; 
&gt; You can deny your issues all you want. The point is you asked for  
&gt; opinions and then get miffed at a serious reply. Anyone who would 
go  
&gt; to the lengths you have to spy on someone has some serious issues. 
Get  
&gt; some help.
&gt; 
&gt; As for recording, they really had you going and feed off your fear. 
I  
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the next thing they tell you is to kill 
or  
&gt; some other crazy antic.
&gt; 
&gt; You asked for help and suggestions. Can&#x27;t take it? Don&#x27;t ask.
&gt; Seems like a good dose of honesty might be just what you need.

&gt; &gt; Maybe your right :) Who is craziest though...the crazy person or 
the
&gt; &gt; person that stays with the crazy person?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I will add that she knew about them and I told her about them 
before I
&gt; &gt; asked her to leave. Besides the gadgets weren&#x27;t strictly for her, 
they
&gt; &gt; were for the weirdness at the new apartment. But thanks for the  
&gt; &gt; shallow
&gt; &gt; help.
