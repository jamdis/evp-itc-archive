It is a couple hundred yards from the state&#39;s largest supplier of\ncrushed limestone for the last 100 years. The grass was mowed but that was\nthe extent of the upkeep. Many tombstones were broken and tossed to the\noutside edge of the cemetery. Many children were buried there. The oldest\ntombstone we found was1815. It was 60 degrees the whole time were there. We\nwere sooo cold and we could easily see our breath. I&#39;ve never heard of any\nparanormal experiences regarding here and we&#39;ve decided to keep\nit anonymous  in an attempt to preserve what is left. The photos are kind of\n&quot;iffy&quot; I might be seeing things where there isn&#39;t anything. I&#39;d appreciate\nany feedback.\n\nEVPs &lt;http://paranormalarcheologysurveyteam.weebly.com/evps.html&gt;\n\nPhotos &lt;http://paranormalarcheologysurveyteam.weebly.com/photos.html&gt;\n\n-- \nVicky\n\nI was looking o some p ac ice on in es iga ing so I ound an old small ceme e y.
