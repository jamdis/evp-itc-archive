Ok, hope you all are able to hear these new files, this is what it's like 
in the lower dark plains, I didn't have time to slow most down or make them 
louder, but if you play them over several times, that is,  if you all have 
time, you'll see how crowed it is in the lower plains, and all these people 
waiting to get into the light or higher realms.  And guess what, like it or 
not the only light over there seems to come from, is, well, hint, it's sure 
not through Mohamed or the Buddah!  Hope you all enjoy, sf
