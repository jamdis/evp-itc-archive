&gt; Bill, nice talking to you again!  I just thought that since we are 
all spread out all over, it just might be something to try.  I know 
your in CA, but I am not sure where everyone else except Frank.  
&gt;    
&gt;   I only have the hacked box so If we set up different boxes at 
different times, we would have to see who has what and when everyone 
is available.  
&gt;    
&gt;   I would be more than happy to help with this exercise.  Do you 
think it would matter if all our communication is different?
&gt;    
&gt;   I would be excited to see all of the Frank&#x27;s Box users do a test 
and well as a combination of boxes.  I think it would make for some 
exciting EVP and confirmation that the other planes just may 
communication regardless of time, space and location.

Good idea 
&gt; Julie. I seem to get a similar voice in a number of sessions that I 
&gt; guess could be considered my counter part. _Bill

&gt; &gt; hey,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; what you are suggesting was at one time and sometimes still is 
&gt; practiced by evp researchers.
&gt; &gt; It is called a combined session and it actually serves to enhance 
&gt; communication by supplying
&gt; &gt; a collective energy. It is a splendid idea and you should post an 
&gt; agenda on the group and give 
&gt; &gt; anyone who is interested an opportunity to be involved in the 
group 
&gt; session.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have not heard of this method being experimented with as far as 
&gt; box research goes
&gt; &gt; just with traditional evp.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And yes your assumption about having guide spirits assigned to us 
&gt; as individual researchers
&gt; &gt; is very much correct. My techs are Mike &amp; Lisa whom I communicate 
&gt; with on a daily basis
&gt; &gt; My research friend and partner Steve hultay also has the same two 
&gt; spirit guides and or technicians 
&gt; &gt; assigned to him. probably because our research always coincides 
and 
&gt; is interwoven with each other
&gt; &gt; I guess they decided to save spirit work load and assign the same 
&gt; tech&#x27;s to both of us.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you decide to organise the group session count me in.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Guys, I have just be wondering if anyone has tried experimenting 
&gt; with running session at the same time in different locations with 
the 
&gt; same boxes?I was curious if in fact even though the frequencies 
would 
&gt; be different depending our your area, if in fact some of the same 
&gt; voices would come through to each of you.It was just a thought? In 
my 
&gt; testing sessions I am coming to find out that they certainly know 
all 
&gt; of you, Frank, Bruce, Mike, etc.. for your names seem to be coming 
&gt; up. Therefore, I wonder if you all have so called &quot;personal 
&gt; assistants&quot; or &quot;tecs&quot; assiged to you or if they are random? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;
