Was this response in relation to something you&#39;d said?  I absolutely can hear it as \nyou are, but I hear it equally well as, &quot;Howard said.&quot;  I notice this a lot in my own \nrecordings, being able to hear a couple very similar sounding phrases in the same \nexample.  \n\nIn regard your post about them maybe being earthbound ... I don&#39;t know how we could \ndetermine that based only on what is said.  I suppose you could do a followup session to \nask who it is, where they are, and if he was talking to you.  I know sometimes in my \nsessions, I&#39;m essentially &#39;eavesdropping&#39; on an other side conversation, and what is being \nsaid doesn&#39;t really apply to me.  Sort of like picking up on a party phone line.  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt;   File        : /Steve Hultay Files/Steve Hultay&#39;s Joe&#39;s Box EVP&#39;s/are_we_dead.mp3 \n&gt;   Uploaded by : urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@...&gt; \n&gt;   Description : &quot;Are We Dead&quot;---One of the best files i think i ever got.
