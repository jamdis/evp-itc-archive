It's=
 too bad you didn't get more participation.=A0 I'd be happy to be part of t=
he second test too.

One thing I'd suggest: remove any question(s) that you=
 are asking, from the audio file.=A0 Since you're trying to study how diffe=
rent people will interpret the same file, and are trying not to give any hi=
nts as to what other people hear in the file, leaving the question in could=
 be a factor there.=A0 For example, if you are asking a yes/no question in =
the audio, then the people listening might be inclined to restrict their an=
swers to having heard a "yes" or a "no" (because the question implies that =
is what may follow).=A0 But by leaving the question out, you remove any hin=
ts as to what they should expect.

Team is my wife Sarah we are both part of the same nonprofit 
orga=

busy I may =
have her answer somthing or post somthing if Iam unable 
otherwise youll al=
ways get me first thing friday and sat so if 
someone has a question on a p=
ost for me depending on what day it is 
you may have to wait till fri or sa=
