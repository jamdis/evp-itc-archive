Misty, The Bennetts (of The Scole Experiment) have been doing some intriguing work with crystals illuminated with light reflected off of various metals. They've posted some of the more facinating pics on the www.aaevp.com website. A few of the pics seem to have some scenery that the faces are in, check it out. I haven't quite made up my mind about this particular research just yet, but if a rapport is developed with the individuals that are coming through, perhaps some messages will follow, just like they did while the Bennetts were participating in the The Scole Experiment.
