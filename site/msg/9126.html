You got it Margaret.  Its more than just to shut this guy down but to  put 
the information out there for support purpose.

Agreed. So, let's put him out of business by giving away the information  for 
free. I think 
between Kay and Jeff, he's going to be out of customers  very soon. Giving 
away the info 
basically closes down this market niche  for this person (and others like 
him), and saves 
unwitting buyers from  themselves.

Make the listing with the same key words he's using so when  his listing 
pulls up, so does 
the one for the free info.
