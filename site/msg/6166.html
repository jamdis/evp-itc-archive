Ron,
 
On the RS box it won't matter how low you put the volume if it wher=
e sweeping the dial and you where getting any signal from
a radio station y=
ou would hear the radio fragments. I will send you a clip of a raw recordin=
g from the RS so you can hear what I mean.
 
A class a evp is a traditional=
 evp that can be heard by anyone without prior explanation and is caught di=
rectly onto whatever recording 
medium you are using. It is generally assum=
ed that a traditional evp is captured 
when a grounded or stuck spirit is i=
n direct proximity of the recorder as apposed to sending the message from t=
he spirit realm. On traditional evp the grounded
spirit will manipulate the=
 ambient energy surrounding you and the recorder such as electromagnetic en=
ergy, to imprint the message directly onto the recorder.
 
This is the most=
 widely accepted theory, As apposed to a box communication which is receive=
d by a spirit either from the other side or grounded depending
on the situa=
tion, and sometimes both on one recorded session, coming through the box in=
 real time manipulating the fragments and frequencies of radio signal to fo=
rm the messages.

Thanks for the confirmation Bruce.  This is a=
ctually the first EVP message that I received and that I actually heard the=
 message.   One word.  It's a start.  The other messages you and others hel=
ped me with don't count for me because I don't hear anything...yet.  I stil=
l will work with those recordings to process slower...when I can figure out=
 how to do that.
 
Regarding HELEN being without the RS box sweep.  I disco=
vered the next day that I had the volume turned way down, so the sweep was =
happening but the segment with HELEN the sweep clicks cannot be heard.   Do=
n't know what a Class A EVP is but it is better than a NO CLASS.  Right?   =
  Did you have a chance to confirm my other one word message which I think =
was my wife's name DINO for Dinorah.  Possibly someone wants to talk with h=
er, which would make sense over here in her hometown in Campeche, Mexico.  =
Quite a few relatives passed over...they have lived in the area for 200 yea=
rs or so.  Second thought, it's a guys voice and I probably don't want to s=

I am=

At first I thought I heard the word BUE=
NO (hello in Spanish) but I now hear DINO with is my wife's name...short fo=
r Dinorah.  She is normally not with me for sessions and was not with me fo=

The other recording I hear the name HELEN.  I don't know anyone wit=
