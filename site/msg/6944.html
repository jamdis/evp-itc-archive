  Frank,
               I have to agree with you on this.  I have attached=
 some clips where I ask what my roll is.  They advised me of several things=
.  Some of the key words are in the clips and the fact that they acknowledg=
e we need proof is amazing to me.  The tec's as well call them are reflecte=
d in the last clip when I asked if I should do a session.  A female say no,=
 and then proceeds to response "you will see".  For whatever its worth, if =
I get some sort of direction as a response, I comply (by choice and in reas=
on).  I can't help but wonder if sometimes they don't have a best interest =
at heart?  Whether they do or not, this is extremely exciting to me, and co=
unt my blessing everyday that I am was lead on this path and will continue =
to follow where ever it takes me.

  Juli
