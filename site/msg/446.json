As a \nmatter of fact when some people said they were glad you left one of the owners said you \nadmitted to over reacting and you apologized to the them for your \ntemper tantrum in defense of you. I guess you forgot about that apology.\n\nVicki, the owner allows everyone to post from the beginning but \nnew members are moderated until one of the owners sees they aren&#39;t spammers and then \nremoves moderation.That is clearly explained on the first page about new \nmember moderation.\n\nIt&#39;s a good idea to get your info correct before talking about people \nbehind their backs. I&#39;dstay as I&#39;m an active member on many paranormal lists, but this has \nreally left a bad taste. The owners of Grass Harp are fine people, and I&#39;ll certainly alert \nthem to this.\n\nGrow up Frank. And to anyone else who plans on staying in Frank&#39;s enemy camp here, you \nare missing some other really good lists."}
