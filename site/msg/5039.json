I&#39;m the guy in Mexico who recently wrote about trashing his new rs hack.  First the battery cable separated then when fixed nothing.  I never noticed if Mike said to be certain to line up the pins when putting the card back together.  You said it so I check and now it actually works.  It is something like checking the refrigerator light when you try to line up the pins.  The real proof is when the thing powers up.  I also needed to realign the five screws to make certain they were in the correct holes.  Thanks for the tip.
