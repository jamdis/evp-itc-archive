Going \nalong these lines of thought, if you are recording the questions \nonto an audio tape and leaving 20 seconds of silence between them, \nyou are still recording you and possibly your thoughts as well as \nany spirits that might be around you or your recording environment \nat that time.  So how do you know that what you listen back on is \nfrom the location you placed the recorder in and not from the \nlocation you recorded the questions in or from your own creation?  \nJust something to think about.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Lynn\n&gt;    \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; Tracy &lt;loneshewolf999@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;             I am not sure this would still rule it out.  I don&#39;t \nthink psychokinesis is restrained by walls, the mind isn&#39;t \nrestrained by walls whether human or deceased.  I am guessing that \npsychokinesis behaves similar to telepathy....\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I believe many evp&#39;s are deceased spirits, but the question on \nwhether it could be a living person imprinting the evps was \ncertainly one that made me really think !  \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Hi James,\n&gt; \n&gt; Back when I still investigated haunted sites, our team did this on \nvarious occasions within a house where we recorded several hours of \nactivity over a few years (a long term investigation). We would \nleave our audio equipment recording in several &quot;hot spots&quot; all over \nthe house and then leave for an hour or two. I have to say, in our \nexperience we never got an EVP while we were out of the house. As a \nmatter of fact we had an EVP when we reentered the house \nsaying, &quot;here they come, lets go&quot;. I don&#39;t necessarily understand \nwhy a ghost or spirit would talk with no one present to receive the \nmessage unless during setup you explained what you are trying to \naccomplish and what the spirits roll is in the experiment (we never \ntried explaining). A piece of machinery (recorders) in an empty room \ndoes not have a consciousness or spiritual presence I would be \ninterested to see if you get different results.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: delchay2005 &lt;azredant@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 18, 2007 6:47:24 PM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] EVP Experiment planned in October.\n&gt; \n&gt;     To try and rule out that the EVP researchers are imprinting \nvoices \n&gt; psychokinetically on audio players mistaken as ghosts voices, I \nwill \n&gt; pre-tape an interactive evp session.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will record a bank of thirty questions, 20 seconds of silence \n&gt; after each question, on a cassete tape and played on a cassette \n&gt; player that will be utilized in all three buildings in a known \n&gt; haunted location just outside of Phoenix, Arizona.\n&gt; \n&gt; There will be digital recorders, cassette recorders, omni \n&gt; directional microphones, condensor microphones, as well as an \n&gt; electrocet boom microphone present in all of the sessions. There \n&gt; will be no human agents in the buildings when these sessions take \n&gt; place.\n&gt; \n&gt; My hope is to:\n&gt; \n&gt; Record an authentic EVP with no human agent in the building. \n&gt; \n&gt; If this is phenomena driven, will the phenomena communicate by \n&gt; responding to questions from a machine rather than a human agent? \n&gt; \n&gt; If you have any ideas to enhance this experiment, please feel free \n&gt; to let me know. This experiment will take place on October 27th. \n&gt; \n&gt; James\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;   Be a better Heartthrob.
