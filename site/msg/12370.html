Wow,=
 this is def. weird. I just got this. A real evp while doing a 
sweep with =
my RS Hack. You'll hear me say: "Anything you'd like to 
say?" and all else=
 is spirit. Sounds to me like a Brit accent saying 
"I think you're beautif=
ul." which is common as he tells me through the 
Ovilus, Robot Box, and now=
 recording live.

There's an odd noise before the male voice and a mumble a=
fter. Very 
weird. There was nothing except the RS Hack on at the time, but=
 this 
didn't come over the radio.
