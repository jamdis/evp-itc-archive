<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>HI GUY&#x27;S JUST A SHORT EXPLANATION OF WHAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER.



ANYONE THAT IS A SERIOUS EVP RESEARCHER HAS PROBABLY READ THE ARTICLES 
AND OR BOOKS PERTAINING TO THE EALY TIME STREAM EXPERIMENTS AND WHAT 
WAS CALLED THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT. IT INVOLVED SUCH RESEARCHERS AS MAGGY 
HERSHBACH AND HER HUSBAND THAT WHERE THE RECIPIENTS OF LONG LENGTHY 
MESSAGES IN ALL DIFFERENT FORMATS FROM THE SPIRIT WORLD THEY IN TURN 
WORKED WITH SUCH EVP PIONEERS AS HANS MUELLER, KONSTANTINE 
RAUDIVA,GEORGE MEEK AND MARK MACY TO NAME A FEW. THESE EARLY PIONEERS 
THROUGH THE HERSHBACHS IN LUXEMBORG RECIEVED DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ON 
HOW TO FURTHER COMMUNICATION THAT NOT ONLY LED TO OUR CURRENT EVP 
GATHERING TECHNIQUES BUT ALSO THE MOTHER OF ALL BOXES THE SPIRICOM.
THESE RESEARCHERS WERE TOLD THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIANT IN THE 
STRENGTH AND FURTHERENCE OF SPIRIT COMMUNICATION WAS HARMONY AND PEACE 
AND GOOD INTENTIONS WITHIN THIS CIRCLE THEY HAD BEEN LED TO FORM.

BUT SADLY AS HUMAN BEINGS USUALLY DO JELOUSY AND EGO BECAME A POISON TO 
THE CIRCLE AND SOME INDIVIDUALS THAT WHERE ENVIOUS OF OTHERS SUPERIOR 
SUCESSES BROUGHT BAD VIBRATIONSS TO THE GROUP AND THE CIRCLE WAS BROKEN.

IMMEDIATLY FOLLOWING THE ADVANCED COMMUNICATION THAT HAD BEEN ENJOYED 
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SLOWLY DWINDLED AWAY.

NOW I BELIEVE WE ARE BEING GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS 
UNPRESIDENTED TASK AND BRIDGE THE GAP OF COMMUNICATION FULLY.
AS OF LATE THERE HAS BEEN A FLOOD OF NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT SEEMS TO BE 
WORKING AS HOPED WE ARE IN OUR FETAL STAGES BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD WE 
WILL BE BROUGHT ALONG SLOWELY AND CAREFULLY.

SO MY THOUGHTS ARE LETS KEEP THE GOOD VIBES AND HARMONY GOING AND BLOCK 
AS MUCH OF THE NEGATIVITY AS WE CAN AND ALL WORK TOGETHER TWORD THIS 
COMMON GOAL. LETS NOT LET THE SINS OF OUR FATHER SO TO SPEAK AFFECT 
WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH.
