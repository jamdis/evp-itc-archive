My name is Carla and I \n&gt; recorded my first evp 2 nights ago. \n&gt; &gt; Again yesterday I was able to get another one but have not been \n&gt; able to tell what it says. I \n&gt; &gt; am going to post them in the file section if anyone is \ninterested. \n&gt; I also was wondering what \n&gt; &gt; everyone thought, especially on the 2nd one since I still don&#39;t \n&gt; know what it says.
