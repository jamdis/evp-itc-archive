Wow!  Silver, too bad it's so expensive, how much silver do you need,  is 
this for building another Spirit Box?  What about titanium?

Looks like platinum is around 9.4 E06 S/m.  Not as good as copper,  silver 
or gold but still a decent conductor.
Iridium is better, at 18.7 E06 S/m. Still not as good as  silver, copper or 
gold.
Platinum-Iridium alloys are worse, at 5.28 E06 S/m.
 
These are all per _http://www.eddy-http://www.ehttp://www._

Silver is the best conductor known, with a conductivity of 63.01 E06

45.2 E06 S/m. Aluminum is much farther down, at 37.8 E06  S/m.
 
Silver and gold are expensive. They are usually used to plate RF  
assemblies where the skin effect takes place (current doesn't flow  uniformly through 
a conductor at RF frequencies but mainly travels at  the surface of the 
conductor). Gold has the advantage that it never  tarnishes or corrodes with 
most things it is exposed to. It's used a lot  in contacts for rotary switches 
and relays.

Firrst Electrical job I was on as a helper in 1976 was to  pick up a pole 
that was to feeding a house someone had wired in  aluminum that had burned to 
the ground due to a bad connection it  had just been built. I had been with 
my old man on a many job  sinhce I was 8 and never had seen anything like 
that. Copper is  the only way to gold only better conductor is Gold. but who 
can  handle that in a house. worste case of emf I have ever seen was a  
fancy chandaler that someone had over sized bulbs in and that  thing flared up 
the whole house to very dangerous levels. when  they say 60 watt max they 
mean it for your own safety. this thing  had around 10 100 watt bulbs in it and 
the emfs were causing all  kinds of nice images after 30 minutes in the 
house we were having  them too.

copper is a great conductor

Aluminum wire is a nightmare! The stuff tends  to overheat, oxidizes where 
interconnections are made  and will spark, etc. 
 
I bought a transformer at Gateway Electronics in St.  Louis some years ago 
that looked like a great transformer  for a high-current 12 volt supply. The 
secondary appeared to  be wound with #8 enameled wire. I found out the 
secondary was  wound with aluminum wire. After I built the power supply  and 
tried to get 20 amps from it but couldn't, I gave up on it  and got another 
transformer wound with copper wire.

We have a touch lamp that comes on by itself, and  we have electric matress

When the furnace  comes on, it affects the boxes, and--when I first  
started doign EVP recordings with white noise, if  the furnace happened to come on 
when I was recording a  voice would report "it's on fire!".
 
 What if that house has aluminum wire?

Yes.  Also faulty wiring, which is even  more dangerous.
Also with flakey transformers  or other power distribution in the area, or 
power  lines.
Perhaps you can check with some  neighbors, and see how their power is  
doing.

Hi  All,
 
Is there  someone here that can answer and electrical  question for me?
 
During the  case that I recorded those possible EVP's-there  was a loud 
tapping noise that seemed to come  from the 2nd bedroom. Upon checking my logs, 
 every time one of  these clicks were heard,  there would be an EMF spike 
in the livingroom.  The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livingroom  downstairs. 
The home owners have also reported  that they have a touch lamp that comes 
on all  the time by itself and the lights in the Kitchen  will dim 
occasionally.
 
Now these  taps are not consistent in timing, loudness or  rhythm. Could 
this be the work of faulty  breakers?
 
Thanks!
April
