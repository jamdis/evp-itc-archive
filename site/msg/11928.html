<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Exactly. Who knows? We can only go on what &quot;they&quot; tell us. They lie.  
Sometimes not. I&#x27;ve seen quite a few cases where grieving parents  
swear they are talking to their &quot;dead&quot; child and others listening to  
their recording don&#x27;t think so, but the entity continues to play that  
roll as they are getting a lot of attention (energy) by claiming to be  
the child.

All I know is I&#x27;m talking to someone/something. Who or what remains a  
mystery.
