<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi, Kristin.  ;)

Yes, I uploaded three audio files recorded near the old church in 
Tallmadge, Ohio (one was recorded about the church, but from within 
the Old Town Hall).  The church was built in 1825 and still active.  
I just knew there was something going on over at it, so I walked over 
and sat at the steps.  

What I didn&#x27;t post was that we did spirit rescue there, as we were 
able to hear some of the communication &quot;live.&quot;  The &quot;help&quot; messages 
seem to go crazy in the active spots, so I feel I have to try and 
assist if possible.  Hope I am doing good for them...

By the way, I gave an old 12-470 to a couple who have been working 
with me out in the field.  They called me to tell me when they turned 
it on they heard my nickname (Chuck) multiple times and then the 
phrase, &quot;Thanks, Chuck.&quot;  LOL  I hope the spirits don&#x27;t think I 
abandoned them!  :)
