There you have it!  The last time I checked, the U.S. of A. was a &quot;Capitalist&quot; country...! That simply means making or buying wholesale a product that will retail for more money than was invested thus making a Profit.  You want an example?  You just have to look at Thomas Edison and Nickola Tesla.  Both were brilliant men,  pioneers in their field,  which was basically the same for both.  One was more brilliant than the other,  in turn the less brilliant &quot;stole&quot; ideas and products from the other.  The most brilliant was not a &quot;Capitalist&quot;,  he devoted his time and efforts to &quot;bettering the lives of mankind&quot;.  The lessor was indeed a &quot;Capitalist&quot;,  his motives were less noble,  however,  and he was willing to &quot;better&quot; mankind,  too,  but make a good profit in the process.  We all know the story...one is foremost in the eyes of the general public,  became personally rich and famous,  while the other died broke and without fanfare.  A shame,  but\n factual,  none-the-less.  Would you work for free?  Would you supply people with something they want without recompense?  I think not.  I certainly wouldn&#39;t!  Get real.  Bruce is going to post a capture, he says, from Nickola Tesla.  I predict that it will be a warning... &quot;Don&#39;t Do What I Did!  Make a Profit!&quot;    --Rod  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n  \nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n       Well...Mean Bitch week was last week, so I was trying to be nice. Yeah, I can make a box for like $50 if it&#39;s on perf board, and $100 if it on PCB, the bare board alone is about $46. The only problem I have is the time. It takes two weeks minumum to get a box together and working. Most people would like to get paid for their time. I make about $40 an hour at my real job. ( been here 24 years!)
