Ok, he says "the world wide animal, birds, fish, bees, bats, ducks, crabs,  
cows,whales, dolphins, buffalo,  etc...deaths are going to continue,  it 
seems they will all return after about 2 or 3 years or so after the permanent  
return of Christ to this world, this will occur after the antichrist has 
all but  destroyed all life, but JC will come back, and stop him."  David says 
that  "the entire animal population may be nearly wiped out before Christ  
returns," things are going to only get worse," right now we are all living 
in  this bubble, thinking it won't happen.
 
It's very sad, I still can't get David to tell me who it is that killing  
the creatures, he only says they will all be brought back to earth after JC's 
 return.  So, stock up on canned food if you can guys, enough to last for 
at  least a year or 2, I buy mine a few extra at a time, and if you are 
translated  over, the food will be there for some one else that gets stuck here 
for that  near 3 years.  I keep hoping to win the lotto, like everyone else, 
then I  would put lots of food in here for people so, they don't starve.   I 
have  the lake down here, our water is from a natural artesian spring 
water, it is 250  feet deep so, it's pretty safe to drink.  And even if I lost 
electricity,  one could always get some water, from the lake out there which 
is private  too.  If I leave, anyone stuck here is welcome to come over here 
to live,  but you will need to probably keep up with the mortgage if there 
is still the  bank left.  Whatever, it's going to be pretty bad from what I 
hear.  sf
