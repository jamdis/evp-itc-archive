&gt; Hi Rees,
&gt;  
&gt; I just got my paranormal puck a couple of days ago and in regular  
people 
&gt; terms, it takes readings from the environment:  EMF  (man-made and 
natural), 
&gt; voltage, frequency, and temperature, and  translate those readings 
into words from 
&gt; a 2,000 word dictionary.  It also  logs all the readings on a 
spreadsheet.  
&gt; You can also set alarms and  threshholds for spikes, and well as 
incorporate a 
&gt; PC camera or audio device to  record pictures, video or audio 
whenever your 
&gt; alarms are reached.  It&#x27;s a  very interesting device.  One of the 
first 
&gt; questions I asked it was  &quot;Who are you?&quot;  It answered &quot;Edison, 
reincarnation&quot;.   I 
&gt; brought  it to a meeting today of the group I belong to, the San 
Francisco Ghost 
&gt; Society,  and when our resident psychic asked it &quot;What&#x27;s my 
name?&quot;  It replied 
&gt; with  the word &quot;Medium&quot;.  Like I said, it&#x27;s a very interesting 
device,  
&gt; indeed!  The inventor refers to the device not as an ITC device, 
but  rather, a ECM 
&gt; device -- for Environmental Communications Mode, as it is driven  
purely from 
&gt; environmental data alone.
