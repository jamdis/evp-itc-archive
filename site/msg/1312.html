<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Misty--OMG. This is amazing. What live recordings did you feed into  
EVPMaker?

I wonder if working with their own voice in EVPmaker makes it easier  
for them to construct an EVP? These are some of the clearest EVP  
through EVPmaker that I have ever heard. I am really astounded.

&gt; Edison&#x27;s historical speech to compare to my evp voice that I  
&gt; wondered what I would get if I threw one of those into evpmaker. I  
&gt; got a little more than I thought I would. It even made me have to  
&gt; google to look up the meaning of one of the technical words LOL
&gt;
&gt; I also included the evp vs life speech side by side comparison with  
&gt; the evp I got from ST method. Since thats how this started and for  
&gt; those who just joined group and have no idea what I am talkin about.
