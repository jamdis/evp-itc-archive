Some feel you need to use an external microphone, but I\ntend to set the recorder down and let it do it&#39;s thing.  I get more\nEVP&#39;s when it is just sitting there unattended or if we are talking\nabout random stuff than I do if asking questions.  I cannot hold my\nrecorders still enough in my hands to not get noise.  An external\nmicrophone would help that, but I would rather just set the recorder\ndown.  Maybe some day I will get one and give it a try.  \n\nThe last investigation we went on, I got 12 good EVP&#39;s.  Most were\nshort single word recordings, but they required no processing other\nthan a volume adjustment on a couple of the quieter ones.  Other\ninvestigations I get nothing.  We would have activity, but nothing\nwould be recorded.  Also, I have recorded stuff only to have it\ndisappear off the recorder or computer.  Guess someone didn&#39;t want it\nto be shared.\n\nTopics to talk about that seem to draw out the spirits are food,\nalcohol, drugs and smoking.  Guess some of the spirits miss them and\nif given a chance will join in and let you know their feelings.  I\nhaven&#39;t tried talking about sex, but if the other topics work, it\nmight also.  I don&#39;t think there is anything magic about getting\nEVP&#39;s.  It is just a matter of being around someone with something to\nsay.  Also, I don&#39;t think the location really has that much to do with\nit either.  I can get recording from my house almost as easily as a\n&quot;haunted&quot; location.  To me, the negative spirits tend to be more vocal\nbut will give false information just to mess with you.  I believe\nlittle if anything I record, but simply use it as evidence of\nactivity.    \n\nI prefer digital for the ease of distributing and archiving\nrecordings.  The only editing I do is adjusting the gain and cutting\nout parts of the recording that catch my interest.  As a personal\npreference, I throw out any EVP&#39;s that need any filtering or\nmanipulation to hear.  If it can&#39;t be heard as it is (excluding volume\nadjustments), I don&#39;t use it.  I promise I am not trying to start an\nargument.  As I said, it is just a personal preference.    \n\nOne of the best recordings I have was from my camcorder.  We could\nalso hear the spirit talking with our ears and were able to briefly\nhave two-way interaction.  The funny thing is, when asked a question,\nthe three of us present heard it say &quot;yes&quot;, but on the audio, it\nclearly said &quot;no&quot;.   \n\nAllen\nwww.paranormalsource.com"}
