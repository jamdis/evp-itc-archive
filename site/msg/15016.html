 my digital voice recorder that I carry with me. We were standing right nex=

I hav=

This instance with the recorders may=

I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave an=
d demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It works off the hete=
rodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another i=
n frequency then if you add or subtract them together you get a beat freque=
ncy or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at =
54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequen=
cy at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference=A0frequency at 9KH=
z, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an exampl=
e, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turnin=
g them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were generated within a =
few inches of the recorder.
=A0
We are able to reproduce this affect in not=
 only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio =
as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio spotli=
ght" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
