I still think the AM band \nis  \n&gt; sweeping slower than it should it seems to stay one a station \nlonger  \n&gt; than it should.

But isn&#39;t it \n&gt; nice \n&gt; &gt; without  all the clicking? And the fm sweep is great on that \n&gt; unit.

It sweeps both bands fine.  Is there any certain rate the \n&gt; band \n&gt; &gt; should be sweeping.
