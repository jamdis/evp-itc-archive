RJ's experiments are to collect data so I can form=C2=A0 conclusions based =
on objective results.=C2=A0 That may prove some theories true, or prove som=
e theories false.=C2=A0 Or show some theories are simply not testable. That=

Read the groups main page for how Frank describes the =
group: "I invite anyone interested to join. I am not really scientific, I j=

take the approach, try different methods, see what works. I go on the =

results I get"

It doesn't say "Only for those who believe what we do".
