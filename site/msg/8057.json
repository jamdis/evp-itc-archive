Thanks so much for listening!  I used my Son&#39;s clock \nradio to record those .. turning the dial back and forth really fast \nwhile speaking and listening recording with DC6.  Many are using DC7 \nnow .. I haven&#39;t tried DC7 yet but all you need to do is press \nthe &quot;LIVE&quot; button and wear headphones and you will hear the played-\nback version (1/4 second delay) and just keep listening and \nanswering .  It took me a while to learn how to speak without hearing \nmyself talk (because of the headphones) ... (You need headphones that \ncover your ear or ear buds so that the recorder doesn&#39;t record itself \nplaying back ..                     \n\nI belive their are some free recording programs that play-back as \nyou&#39;re recording .. I&#39;ll post them when I find them!\n\nDebbie\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Misty&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hiya Debbie. I finally got a chance to listen to your files today. \n&gt; Great stuff! I could hear that as you did. Perhaps you could do a \npost \n&gt; on your setup for the newbies who never heard of dc6 or the ways it \ncan \n&gt; be used.\n&gt;  \n&gt; They came thru pretty darn loud and clear for that one!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;misujoey&quot; &lt;Debbie@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I recorded this sweeping manually and listening via \nDC6 &quot;LIVE&quot; ... \n&gt; Hope \n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re able to hear it ..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Debbie\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
