Why and how I don&#39;t understand. But I&#39;ve\nbeen in a room with 6 or 7 other people who are all within a few feet\nof each other trying to record EVP&#39;s and only one gets a response.\nThen 10 minutes later someone else does and the others do not.\n\nI have also seen this with photographs. Some people will get a certain\nthing on a photo and others taking a photo at the same time don&#39;t get\nanything.\n\nI imagine it&#39;s the same way with the box. Maybe whatever is\ncommunicating through the box just doesn&#39;t like some people and won&#39;t\nproduce any messages for them.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn 11/9/11, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  I have only one requirement, can I understand it?

So criticize all ya want, it still works just fine, any\n&gt; failure to receive messages is in the loose nut in front of the control\n&gt; panel. Point your finger at yourself when you tell how my stuff not work.\n&gt; Random mode is dead mode since we==on this group--discovered linear and\n&gt; manual sweep works much better. The voice recording was done by Misty, the\n&gt; actual owner of the group, by manual sweep. Yeah, wonder why I ain&#39;t\n&gt; impressed by claims of superior knowledge.\n&gt;\n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
