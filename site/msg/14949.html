It wasn't suicide, it was accidental:

Carradine Death Was Acc=
idental

IMDb, June 4, 2009

David Carradine died during a sex game that we=
nt wrong, according to sources in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was found dea=
d on Thursday.

Carradine's body was discovered in a hotel suite and local =
reports suggested he committed suicide. 

He was discovered by a maid, nake=
d and hanged, but the suggestions his death had a sexual twist were strongl=
y disputed by the star's close friend, attorney Vicki Roberts, and his mana=
ger Chuck Binder, who insisted he died of natural causes. 

But a statement=
 from Carradine's representative now indicates the actor died during a sex =
act.

The spokesperson tells TMZ.com, "We can confirm 100 percent that he n=
ever would have committed suicide. It was an accidental death. Everybody is=
 in shock." 

Rumours Carradine died attempting auto-erotic asphyxiation- -=
where victims achieve heightened sexual pleasure by restricting their air s=
upply are backed up by a quote a Bangkok police officer gave to British new=
spaper The Sun. 

The cop tells reporters, "A rope was attached to his neck=
 and also to his penis". 

Rocker Michael Hutchence was rumoured to have di=
ed attempting the same sex act in a Sydney, Australia, hotel room back in 1=
997--although his death was officially declared a suicide.

Carradine was i=
n Thailand to shoot the movie "Stretch." He was 72.
