<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hmm.  Most audio editors can reverse speech at a click these days, maybe I
should try another one because I did not get anything playing a recording of
my voice backwards.  I agree with you wholly that there is a distinction
between mind and brain, most people overlook this.

&gt;  I was doing reverse speech before EVP, and it works. Not only that,
&gt; spirits and other entities talk backward too.  I had a reversing deck, but
&gt; it broke in our move. You can record yourself, and reverse it, use it for
&gt; psycho analysis. We&#x27;re dealing with mind, not brain, so this stuff is
&gt; universal.

&gt;&gt; Don&#x27;t know if you have heard of this guy, but John Oates has made a living
&gt;&gt; claiming that reverse speech messages are the one way the unconscious cannot
&gt;&gt; lie.  He also claims that reverse speech messages are almost always linked
&gt;&gt; to the forward speech message.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Some of his examples are quite intriguing, but I don&#x27;t buy it fully yet.
&gt;&gt;  I have recorded my own voice and played it backwards and got zilch.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But, if there is some truth to it, maybe we should all be reversing some
&gt;&gt; of our files from time to time just in case.  Wouldn&#x27;t it be a startling
&gt;&gt; find to have this be true not only of the living, but also in those who
&gt;&gt; communicate through the box a well.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just about yelling it now. Reversed &quot;cuz we&#x27;re gonna make you a
&gt;&gt;&gt; spirit--(or regret it-?)&quot;.  Maybe I hear/think/wanna believe too much.
