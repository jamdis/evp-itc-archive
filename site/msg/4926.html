At the AA-EVP conference a few years ago Sarah said she would frequent
a funeral home as a child. I believe she said her family lived in an
adjoining building. She would speak to those that recently passed away
and felt they were listening to her and she listened back. She
eventually began recording to tape and founded the AA-EVP in '82.

Sarah also spoke of using evp methods to contact beings who live on
other planets as well as in worlds that were invisible to us but just
as real.
