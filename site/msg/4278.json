It&#39;s \na &quot;phase&quot; thing.  When the &quot;click&quot; (or any sound wave) is reached at \nthe input mic at 180 degrees out of phase with the original I \nunderstand there is a cancel effect.  That works with any sound wave I \nthink, so you&#39;re bound to have some &quot;clicks&quot; and their 180 out of phase \nwave reaching the mic nearly at the same time, cancelling somewhat.\nThere is so much bouncing going on in there I would love to see what \nthe entire pattern looks lke on a scope.  There must be alot of phase \nshifting going on.\n\nI tried my prototype with and without the chamber yesterday.  I found a \nBIG different, and I&#39;m sticking with the chamber effect.  For one \nthing, it increased the amplification at least three-fold when I used \nthe chamber, not to mention all the mixing and phasing.\n\nI hope to play some of my box audio files tonight on my internet radio \nshow. Both from my chamber system and from the three 12-469/mixer \nsystem.\n\nHey, LC... keep up the good work, and thanks for sharing!\n\n- Mike\n\n------\nAll my Radio Shack Hack videos can be found here:\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com\n\nMy internet radio show can be found here:\nhttp://www.ghosttoghostpm.com\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks, Mike.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I am still working on different set-ups in a sound chamber.  I \n&gt; realize the chamber is not necessary, but I think with the 12-469, it \n&gt; helps to run it into a box to mix it, which helps remove the &quot;click&quot; \n&gt; noise received while it sweeps the AM band.  Also, I want to try \n&gt; bouncing down an echo chamber, so it slows the sound down a bit to \n&gt; possibly make it easier to hear.
