&gt; Hi All;
&gt; 
&gt;  Suitable tuners have always been a problem, and try to find a good usable
&gt; digital tuner, which is required for the boxes, since digital tuners are
&gt; really just a voltage tuned radio(except for the ones that use the I2C bus).
&gt; Manually tuned radios are more common and cheap, but the problem is trying
&gt; to figure out what the value of the tuning cap is so it&#x27;s function can be
&gt; duplicated with tuning diodes. You just have to add a couple DC blocking
&gt; caps to convert a radio to varactors.
&gt; 
&gt;  I ordered a capacitance meter from China for 20 bucks that should help
&gt; solve the problem. No wonder the US is going bankrupt, ya can&#x27;t find
&gt; anything comparable here, well I could find it, but twice the price. I hate
&gt; to not buy US, but with electronics there&#x27;s not much choice.
