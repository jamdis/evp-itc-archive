<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s hard to tell how much good this does as there is no shortage of
stations here in Denver. Seems to boost weak stations, but I&#x27;m pretty sure
if there are no stations out there, you&#x27;d just amplify noise. Now I need to
set up a car tuner and see if this helps with those. We were taught in ham
radio literature(Amateur Radio Handbook) that the purpose of an RF amp was
to improve signal to noise ratios.
