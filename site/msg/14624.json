It \n&gt; &gt; could possibly be STIFF.. Canâ€™t be sure though. As for the longer 2nd clip \n&gt; &gt; I can really only hear the whisper that says YES right before you state â€&quot;you\n&gt; &gt; â€™re gonna go nowâ€. I know there was someone trying to communicate because \n&gt; &gt; there were a couple times I heard something but it was indiscernible to \n&gt; &gt; me. \n&gt; &gt; k \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ____________________________________\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;ST1&gt;EVP-ITC@y [mailto: [mailto:&lt;ST1&gt;E ] On Behalf Of Not given\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, May 22, 2009 6:12 PM\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;ST1&gt;EVP-ITC@y \n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] What do you think part 2\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; thanks for the feedback btw in the first one did you hear around 15 \n&gt; &gt; seconds .. thanks?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyhow here is the rest of that piece.
