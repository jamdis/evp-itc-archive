<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Sam,

I bought a Mini-Box -- the first one off the production line, in fact
-- and yes, it is a lot clearer than either of my two Frank&#x27;s Boxes,
which I pointed out on the air on C2C.  I also have the RS Hack, and
it works quite well, and certainly provides an economical alternative
to people.

For the record, I have no vested interest in Mini-boxes, the hacks or
any ITC devices.  I have stated opinions about the Mini and it&#x27;s
advantages, and it&#x27;s OK to have those used as testimonials. I am using
a variety of devices in my work, and they are all valuable to me.  I
travel a lot, so the Mini and the RSH will be the devices of choice,
especially since they are more portable and less fragile than the FBs. 

Regards
Rosemary

&gt; I&#x27;m new to this group, but not to ITC research. I&#x27;m familiar with
&gt; spirit communications using boxes like Frank&#x27;s, the mini-box, and RS
&gt; hack. I&#x27;ve seen the picture of Frank with the mini-box. Frank, it
&gt; looks to me that you are promoting this mini-box. Is that correct? If
&gt; so, is it the only box that you are promoting now? Or are they just
&gt; using your image and a few of your statements to push their box? What
&gt; I heard of the C2C show it seemed to me that it was more of a
&gt; promotion for the mini-box. They posted something about that their box
&gt; has a cleaner signal and Frank&#x27;s box had more noise to it. Well,
&gt; sometimes in this line of work you want to have a little bit of
&gt; inherent noise. I know that the RS radio has to meet FCC Class B
&gt; regulations Part 15. As for being a cleaner signal, I would think that
&gt; the RS radio would actually be, than the mini-box. I have heard both
&gt; the mini-box and the RS hack and I can&#x27;t tell a lot of differences
&gt; between the two except for the price. It&#x27;s my understanding that the
&gt; mini-box is selling around $400 and that&#x27;s a lot of money for just a
&gt; AM radio. The RS radio is selling for $24.95 and I know people are
&gt; getting some great results with the RS hack. Just my two cents worth!!
