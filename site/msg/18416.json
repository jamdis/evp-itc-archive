Apparently there&#39;s one that gets poor reviews at Amazon because it seems to pick up voices from nowhere.\n\nThat sounds like a good candidate for EVP, etc... no pun intended.\n\nI wanted to see if anyone on this list had talked about this, but Yahoo Groups&#39; search form isn&#39;t working.\n\nHas this been discussed? Tested?  \n\nOpinions?\n\nCheerfully,\nFiona"}
