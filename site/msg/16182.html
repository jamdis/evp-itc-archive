MEXICO CITY - Apolinario Chile Pixtun is tired of being bombarded wi=
th frantic questions about the Mayan calendar supposedly "running out" on D=
ec. 21, 2012. After all, it's not the end of the world.

Or is it?

Definit=
ely not, the Mayan Indian elder insists. "I came back from England last yea=
r and, man, they had me fed up with this stuff."

It can only get worse for=
 him. Next month Hollywood's "2012" opens in cinemas, featuring earthquakes=
, meteor showers and a tsunami dumping an aircraft carrier on the White Hou=
se.

At Cornell University, Ann Martin, who runs the "Curious? Ask an Astro=
nomer" Web site, says people are scared.

"It's too bad that we're getting =
e-mails from fourth-graders who are saying that they're too young to die," =
Martin said. "We had a mother of two young children who was afraid she woul=
dn't live to see them grow up."

Chile Pixtun, a Guatemalan, says the dooms=
day theories spring from Western, not Mayan ideas.

A significant time peri=
od for the Mayas does end on the date, and enthusiasts have found a series =
of astronomical alignments they say coincide in 2012, including one that ha=
ppens roughly only once every 25,800 years.

But most archaeologists, astro=
nomers and Maya say the only thing likely to hit Earth is a meteor shower o=
f New Age philosophy, pop astronomy, Internet doomsday rumors and TV specia=
ls such as one on the History Channel which mixes "predictions" from Nostra=
damus and the Mayas and asks: "Is 2012 the year the cosmic clock finally wi=
nds down to zero days, zero hope?"

It may sound all too much like other do=
omsday scenarios of recent decades - the 1987 Harmonic Convergence, the Jup=
iter Effect or "Planet X." But this one has some grains of archaeological b=
asis.

One of them is Monument Six.

Found at an obscure ruin in southern M=
exico during highway construction in the 1960s, the stone tablet almost did=
n't survive; the site was largely paved over and parts of the tablet were l=
ooted.

It's unique in that the remaining parts contain the equivalent of t=
he date 2012. The inscription describes something that is supposed to occur=
 in 2012 involving Bolon Yokte, a mysterious Mayan god associated with both=
 war and creation.

However - shades of Indiana Jones - erosion and a crack=
 in the stone make the end of the passage almost illegible.

Archaeologist =
Guillermo Bernal of Mexico's National Autonomous University interprets the =
last eroded glyphs as maybe saying, "He will descend from the sky."

Spooky=
, perhaps, but Bernal notes there are other inscriptions at Mayan sites for=
 dates far beyond 2012 - including one that roughly translates into the yea=
r 4772.

And anyway, Mayas in the drought-stricken Yucatan peninsula have b=
igger worries than 2012.

"If I went to some Mayan-speaking communities and=
 asked people what is going to happen in 2012, they wouldn't have any idea,=
" said Jose Huchim, a Yucatan Mayan archaeologist. "That the world is going=
 to end? They wouldn't believe you. We have real concerns these days, like =
rain."

The Mayan civilization, which reached its height from 300 A.D. to 9=
00 A.D., had a talent for astronomy

Its Long Count calendar begins in 3,11=
4 B.C., marking time in roughly 394-year periods known as Baktuns. Thirteen=
 was a significant, sacred number for the Mayas, and the 13th Baktun ends a=
round Dec. 21, 2012.

"It's a special anniversary of creation," said David =
Stuart, a specialist in Mayan epigraphy at the University of Texas at Austi=
n. "The Maya never said the world is going to end, they never said anything=
 bad would happen necessarily, they're just recording this future anniversa=
ry on Monument Six."

Bernal suggests that apocalypse is "a very Western, C=
hristian" concept projected onto the Maya, perhaps because Western myths ar=
e "exhausted."

If it were all mythology, perhaps it could be written off.
=

But some say the Maya knew another secret: the Earth's axis wobbles, sligh=
tly changing the alignment of the stars every year. Once every 25,800 years=
, the sun lines up with the center of our Milky Way galaxy on a winter sols=
tice, the sun's lowest point in the horizon.

That will happen on Dec. 21, =
2012, when the sun appears to rise in the same spot where the bright center=
 of galaxy sets.

Another spooky coincidence?

"The question I would ask th=
ese guys is, so what?" says Phil Plait, an astronomer who runs the "Bad Ast=
ronomy" blog. He says the alignment doesn't fall precisely in 2012, and dis=
tant stars exert no force that could harm Earth.

"They're really super-dup=
er trying to find anything astronomical they can to fit that date of 2012,"=
 Plait said.

But author John Major Jenkins says his two-decade study of Ma=
yan ruins indicate the Maya were aware of the alignment and attached great =
importance to it.

"If we want to honor and respect how the Maya think abou=
t this, then we would say that the Maya viewed 2012, as all cycle endings, =
as a time of transformation and renewal," said Jenkins.

As the Internet ga=
ined popularity in the 1990s, so did word of the "fateful" date, and some b=
egan worrying about 2012 disasters the Mayas never dreamed of.

Author Lawr=
ence Joseph says a peak in explosive storms on the surface of the sun could=
 knock out North America's power grid for years, triggering food shortages,=
 water scarcity - a collapse of civilization. Solar peaks occur about every=
 11 years, but Joseph says there's evidence the 2012 peak could be "a lulu.=
"

While pressing governments to install protection for power grids, Joseph=
 counsels readers not to "use 2012 as an excuse to not live in a healthy, r=
esponsible fashion. I mean, don't let the credit cards go up."

Another His=
tory Channel program titled "Decoding the Past: Doomsday 2012: End of Days"=
 says a galactic alignment or magnetic disturbances could somehow trigger a=
 "pole shift."

"The entire mantle of the earth would shift in a matter of =
days, perhaps hours, changing the position of the north and south poles, ca=
using worldwide disaster," a narrator proclaims. "Earthquakes would rock ev=
ery continent, massive tsunamis would inundate coastal cities. It would be =
the ultimate planetary catastrophe."

The idea apparently originates with a=
 19th century Frenchman, Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, a priest-tu=
rned-archaeologist who got it from his study of ancient Mayan and Aztec tex=
ts.

Scientists say that, at best, the poles might change location by one d=
egree over a million years, with no sign that it would start in 2012.

Whil=
e long discredited, Brasseur de Bourbourg proves one thing: Westerners have=
 been trying for more than a century to pin doomsday scenarios on the Maya.=
 And while fascinated by ancient lore, advocates seldom examine more recent=
 experiences with apocalypse predictions.

"No one who's writing in now see=
ms to remember that the last time we thought the world was going to end, it=
 didn't," says Martin, the astronomy webmaster. "There doesn't seem to be a=
 lot of memory that things were fine the last time around."
