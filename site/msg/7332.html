&gt; As far as I know. The only other investigative paranormal shows (in
&gt; the states) still on the air are the TAPS related ones (TAPS and TAPS
&gt; International) on SciFi. And I haven&#x27;t seen them use a box yet.

Some paranormal tv personalities have been talking it up on radio
interviews, though.  Both Patrick Burns of Haunting Evidence and Chris
Fleming of Dead Famous were really excited about it after getting to
working with some investigators who had various versions of ghost
boxes recently.  I would be willing to bet that Chris will use them in
whatever his new series is.
