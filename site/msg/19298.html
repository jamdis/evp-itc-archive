<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sounding good so far, Frank.  You are right, the audio quality in these prefabbed boomboxes is superior.

In the AM boost clip I hear:

.03  hultay
.07  find Tim

The rest I believe is radio noise, especially Shanahan at the end.  I am not sure what the first word said in this clip is though, it may be a message of sorts.


In the first FM clip I hear:

.03 alright
.04 Fay
.11 I don&#x27;t tape record the one (not very clear, but this is what it sounds like to my ears)


In the last FM clip I hear:

.01 Getting called from me -or- Getting call from Dee
.06 Help people
.11 Right this hand (not very clear, but this is what it sounds like to my ears)

Nice work as usual!

Tim

&gt;  Just need a switch for the AM antenna amp. FM kinda noisy. &quot;PLL&quot;==phase
&gt; locked loop. This one has a delay when fiorst turned on, or when the band is
&gt; changed, it has to wait for the sweep to bottom out before the sound comes
&gt; on.
