Well one good thing that we can say about this part that you point out is 
that we can say that your family at least have become spirits and not ghosts. 
They have moved on to other worlds because only a spirit can show you 
different, favorite forms of themselves on earth. They have that freedom. A ghost 
is just stuck and cant move past where they are at this time unless they 
get some help, I guess. 
 
also  Deb's :<< It would follow, that there is some kind of tuning in going 
on, after all. 
And it also seems to me that maybe you are also 'tuning' in psychically 
while using the box, just its subtle.>>
 
I know for certain that tuning in for us is a matter of focus and that's 
what happens with the box. Instead of the word focus/tuning, it just 
frequency/tuning mechanically. We do it mechanically too with intent, a shift in 
focus.

months, no photos in my head.
