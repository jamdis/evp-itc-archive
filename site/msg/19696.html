Hey, hey, hey!
=C2=A0
I don't think you're ignorant at all, Frank. Don't sa=
y those things.=C2=A0 ;)
=C2=A0
Not that it matters, but you're not in any =
danger of pissing me off with this stuff. I love what you have to say about=
 these things, I enjoy the dialogue immensely=C2=A0and I listen closely whe=
n you speak. I think you have a very good, solid=C2=A0grasp when it comes t=
o the boxes and who/what we're communicating with, what's likely to be goin=
g on here=C2=A0and what their abilities and=C2=A0limitations may be. I come=
 here to learn from you (and others)=C2=A0and to consider all of the angles=
 in my attempt to further my own experience and understanding=C2=A0about th=
is stuff. 
=C2=A0
At the end of the day, my guess is NOT as good as yours i=
s, Frank. At least not at this point. 
=C2=A0
You're probably right about t=
he ET's and I like to think in terms of levels and layers as well. For the =
most part I think the boxes are tuning into a very close spiritual level/la=
yer/dimension=C2=A0and that=C2=A0SOME ("some") of it turns out to be astral=
 junk and low-level entities maquerading as something they're not. 
=C2=A0
=
(Come to think of it, maybe it's not so different over there, lol!). 
=C2=
=A0
That said, I know we can "tune into" and access all sorts of these=C2=
=A0dimensions and levels of consciousness and the=C2=A0intelligent beings t=
hat reside there=C2=A0with our=C2=A0sweeping radios. I think we've both had=
 the experience of speaking to loved ones who crossed over as well as=C2=A0=
ET's, angels, spirit guides and even plants, animals, the mineral kingdom=
=C2=A0and LIVING PEOPLE at times too. I'm sure others have had=C2=A0these k=
inds of sessions=C2=A0as well and I love hearing about our different experi=
ences and thoughts on the subject. 
=C2=A0
Part of my own work and meditati=
ons with the boxes=C2=A0reflect my own=C2=A0repeated attempts to reach a hi=
gher level of intelligent being, a finer-faster energy and more refined con=
sciousness during my sessions and recordings. I recognize it immediately wh=
en one of the "dark dorks" or low-level beings creeps through...for me it's=
 still very much a "hit or miss" kinda deal and I'm learning more all the t=
ime regarding how=C2=A0to increase my positive results and consistency of g=
ood information coming through the boxes. =C2=A0
=C2=A0
I've had several st=
rong experiences with the boxes and messages that may=C2=A0indicate or hint=
 at=C2=A0something about to happen and then it did, but for me it's usually=
 a few days or even a few weeks off (though there have been cases when what=
 they said would happen DID happen almost immediately - the plane crash I s=
poke about a few weeks ago was one of them).=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
It's really hard=
 for me=C2=A0to say much more than "I don't know" at this point, which is w=
hy I take what you and the other members=C2=A0share here and consider it al=
ong with everything else. It's very helpful and I appreciate what you have =
to say, Frank. 
=C2=A0
I totally agree with you=C2=A0in that I also=C2=A0fe=
el=C2=A0like ET's=C2=A0being such Highly Evolved Beings (or "HEB's" as I li=
ke to call them) are more likely to have a better grasp on the whole time-s=
pace issue=C2=A0as we know and experience it while living on this planet.=
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
There have been=C2=A0sessions when I've asked the discarnate=
=C2=A0voices how long ago they passed or how old they are/were or what day =
it is "over there" and many times=C2=A0they seem unable to answer, hesitant=
 at times, confused at=C2=A0others=C2=A0and often=C2=A0completely un-aware =
(or possibly just=C2=A0un-interested) when it comes to questions about thei=
r sense of time and how they experience and comprehend such a thing.
=C2=A0=

For the most part I've quit asking questions altogether and use my time wi=
th the boxes to just listen for whatever they feel like addressing during t=
he session and recording. 
=C2=A0
Thanks for that!=C2=A0 :) :) :) 
=C2=A0
I=
'll end by saying I find these conversations of great value and importance =
and I learn something new from you and the other members here every single =
day. It's all great food for thought and exactly the type of dialogue that =
needs to take place if we're ever going to get closer to the truth and a re=
al understanding of what's going on here. 
=C2=A0
I appreciate ya.

Just my two cents and inpu=
t based=C2=A0on what I get from my ancestral guides and guardians...
=C2=A0=

The spiritual dimension and those who reside there=C2=A0do not=C2=A0percei=
ve "time" as we do in=C2=A0the typical=C2=A0linear fashion. Remember the sa=

=C2=A0
10,000 years here may only seem =

us levels, layers, alternative realities and spiritual/energetic dimensions=
.
=C2=A0
The end of the Earth has already happened (for them and us!) in ma=
ny ways. Depending on who you're speaking=C2=A0to, some even describe what =
it was like when=C2=A0the planet Earth was destroyed, speaking as though it=

 event has already occured thousands of years ago, 5 minutes ago, 3 days fr=

=C2=A0
So which one is the RIGHT one then? 
=C2=A0
Well, I think they all =
are. 
=C2=A0
Because "they" live in a world of "source energy", light, cons=
ciousness and perfect=C2=A0information fields...one that's=C2=A0so complete=
ly and totally different to our own experience here/now=C2=A0and are=C2=A0n=

 we are, it's likely very difficult for most of the beings we would speak t=
o through the box to give us specific information regarding such an event o=
r the exact time (or even "which Earth" they are referencing, dimensionally=
 speaking!). 
=C2=A0
In other words, they don't experience any of this stuf=
f (and especially=C2=A0"time") like we do. =C2=A0
=C2=A0
To end,=C2=A0for s=

F=

by a near-perfect "dip" before it went off the charts and moved into "nothi=

<DIV>Just my two ce=
nts and input based on what I get from my ancestral guides and guardia=
ns...</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>The spiritual dimension and those who re=
side there do not perceive "time" as we do in the typical&nb=
sp;linear fashion. Remember the saying, <EM>"In the twinkling of an eye?"</=
EM></DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>10,000 years here may only seem like a few=
 precious moments over there, and vice versa. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>=

<DIV>They also remind me of the quantum field, string theory, our hol=
ographic Universe (etc) and that <EM><U>ALL time is "ticking"</U></EM>=
 (past, present & future) at the very same moment. It's all happen=
ing RIGHT NOW in various levels, layers, alternative realities an=
d spiritual/energetic dimensions.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>The end of t=
he Earth has already happened (for them and us!) in many ways. Depending on=
 who you're speaking to, some even describe <EM>what it was like</EM> =
when the planet Earth was destroyed, speaking as though it has/had alr=
eady occured. There would also be dimensions in which this event has a=
lready occured thousands of years ago, 5 minutes ago, 3 days from now and 1=
0,000 years into the future and every other possible scenario. </DIV>
<DIV>=
 </DIV>
<DIV>So which one is the RIGHT one then? </DIV>
<DIV> </D=
IV>
<DIV>Well, I think they all are. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Because =
"they" live in a world of "source energy", light, consciousness and perfect=
 information fields...one that's so completely and totally differ=
ent to our own experience here/now and are not limited by linear =
time and local/non-local space or relativity like we are, it's likely =
very difficult for most of the beings we would speak to through the box to =
give us specific information regarding such an event or the exact time (or =
even "which Earth" they are referencing, dimensionally speaking!). </DIV>
<=
DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>In other words, they don't experience any of this stu=
ff (and especially "time") like we do.  </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
=
<DIV>To end, for several years now I've been a devoted care-=
giver to the ancient quartz crystal skulls of Mayan legend a=
nd much of the mythologies and folklore surrounding these objects is focuse=
d around 2012 and the impending Great Shift. I've also studied So=
uth American culture (past and present), anthropology, folklore a=
nd tribal customs along with their indigenous wisdom systems in v=
arying depth with the Kogi Indians, Quechua Curanderos and residents o=
f the Amazon. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>For many years I followed the w=
ork of Terence McKenna rather closely and Terence is someone I conside=
r a man-genius far ahead of his time (may he rest in peace). He developed a=
 time-mapping system based on the I-Ching, the Mayan Calendar, Great Pyrami=
ds, DMT-beings, fractals, plant consciousness and other mathematic sys=
tems that showed a sharp spike followed by a near-perfect "dip" before=
 it went off the charts and moved into "nothingness" completely around Dece=
mber 21st, 2012...and even Terence didn't think this is when the world woul=
d end, necessarily. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>(His "official" position =
is that he simply didn't know what to make of it or expect. One theory is t=
hat his algorithms reflected such a change during a time that humanity=
 may have finally broken the time/space barrier and uncovered the keys to t=
ime travel and 4th dimensional plane-shifting, to name just one possible so=
lution.).  </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I've also been fortunate enou=
gh to live in Swaziland, South Africa with the Swazi, Zulu, Xhosa and =
San Bushmen tribes who (like most other cultures throughout time and histor=
y) also have their own teachings and mystery traditions surrounding<BR=
>this and other events. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Given that the San ar=
e the most ancient tribal peoples and humanities oldest ancestors still liv=
ing in the world today and whose incredible healing knowledge, spiritual wi=
sdoms and mystical practices far exceed any I've ever heard of or personall=
y witnessed anywhere else in the world and they don't seem to feel that lif=
e on this planet is going to end anytime soon, so I'm not going t=
o panic just yet. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>These amazing people have t=
heir ears pressed up very closely to the heartbeat and rhythms of Mother Ea=
rth and told me firsthand that before the end comes certain events will tak=
e place on a scale the whole world will be instantly made aware of...events=
 that could still take several hundred or even thousands of years to unfold=
.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>All I know for my own self, personally, is t=
hat I have no clue what's going to happen...but it will be okay, no matter =
what takes place. There are worst things than dying, believe me...and part =
of what makes our work with the Ghost Box and ITC in general so helpful and=
 inspiring is that we can find a level of peace and comfort through our ses=
sions and recordings we might actually need one day, whether soon or in som=
e distant time - we're all going to end up there eventually, no doubt about=
 it! </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>FINAL NOTE:</STRONG> I don't hav=
e all the answers...I don't even have all the questions, and I know it. My =

ll of this (I'm open to that and I'm perfectly fine with it). Believe =
