<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well guys, I have to tell you that since I started box sessions in 
November I have become so spoiled that conventional EVP just don&#x27;t do 
it for me.  

My organization was asked to come and do an investigation at a very 
historial place (here in Illinois).  The owner of this home asked if I 
would bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed with the 
immediately 2 way communication).  So upon respectfully asking my tec 
if it was alright to do a session outside the my home we did several 
box sessions along with conventional EVP.  We wanted to see if we could 
discover some unanswered history about the residence, and the otherside 
was more than willing to comply.  

I have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were and are the 
most boring data to review.  Something I use to love so much has 
actually turned into a project given I am waiting for a response 
immediately!  Too funny how things can change overnight!

I will be uploading some files for these sessions if you are interested.

Juli</pre>
