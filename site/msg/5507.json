We&#39;re all agreed\naboutpursuing this research in a positive frame of mind. If you have\nanaturally positive one, or if you need to do something ritualistic\ntoremind yourself that you are in a positive mindset, it really\ndoesn&#39;tmatter. The same end is obtained.We&#39;re all okay, no matter\nwhich waywe get to the positive vibe. As John Lennon said, &quot;Whatever\ngets youthrough the night, its alright.&quot;You&#39;re both splendid\nresearchers and you are both right, HMO.Ann--- In\nEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Bruce,&gt;\n&gt; No problem, you are entitled to your perspective and opinion.\nIreally don&#39;t see anywhere in my post, a stance being made beside\nmyagreeing with Sumption. Since you mentioned it, I have a problem\nwithpeople who consider themselves to be advanced researchers in\nITCtelling others that there are things you need protection from in\nthisfield. I have seen this fear mongering over the many years I have\nbeeninvolved with my research and the research of colleagues\nandassociates and it has never helped anyone. Are there negative\nentitiesout there that want to influence you and distract you? Sure\nthere are!Probably just as many who want to help you and they have\nbeen theresince the beginning of each of our lives.&gt; &gt; The rule of\nthumb in dealing with those negative forces is to notfollow their\nmessages. If the message is basically negative then giveit no merit\nand carry on. No ritual needed! Now if you wantcredentials I can give\nyou my &quot;paranormal resume&quot; and let the pissingcontest begin. All you\nneed to know about me is I know enough to knowthat the more I learn\nand experience the more I realize I have a lotto learn. Ego you say,\nnot at all. &gt; &gt; Best regards,&gt; &gt; Frank R.&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message\n----&gt; From: bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt;&gt; To:\nEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt; Sent: Monday, January 14, 2008 8:29:15 AM&gt;\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] For Frank R. this is long but I think worth the\nread&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank,&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me say at the\nonset this is not meant as an attack and I will not &gt; &gt; get into a\npissing match over it, but I did feel I needed to address &gt; &gt; it.&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; I promised myself that I would not post a response to any one &gt; &gt;\nperson,only to a subject in general, but I will have to break that &gt; &gt;\npromise on this one.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think your response to the ritual\nprotection post was egotistical, &gt; &gt; careless and uninformed. That was\nthe response I would expect from a &gt; &gt; close minded sceptic that had\nno real experience in this field.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a researcher in the\nparanormal in general you should know that &gt; &gt; there is a very real\nand present danger from darker entities, &gt; &gt; especially in the field\nof box research that is still in its infancy &gt; &gt; and our knowledge is\nnot advanced enough using this method to be so &gt; &gt; hap hazard about\nit.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All are entitled to their own opinion as far as the way\nthey go about &gt; &gt; their own research but to advise that protection\nfrom the negative &gt; &gt; means nothing and to do it in an open forum\nwhere there are &gt; &gt; impressionable new individuals that are just\nentering into this &gt; &gt; research is very careless on your part.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\nSome researchers here including Steve and myself among other have &gt; &gt;\nrecorded files with messages that tell us that the communication &gt; &gt;\nprocess is being hindered at that time by what we refer to as &gt; &gt;\n&quot;dark heads&quot; and our spirit contacts actually use that term. they &gt; &gt;\nhave also told us when asked why communication was so bad that it was\n&gt; &gt; being blocked by negative entities. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I only one of a few\nthat have gotten this exact communication. So &gt; &gt; there is a real\nthreat from negative energy or entities.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Plus through research\nwe have found that it is possible for entities &gt; &gt; to travel back and\nforth between our realms during an open box &gt; &gt; session. If you\nlistened to numerous files Steve and I have posted &gt; &gt; asking our\nfriends mike and Lisa on the other side to insure that all &gt; &gt; and any\nspirits that may have traveled through please go back and &gt; &gt; have\ngotten conformation from them every time.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is possible for\nan entity to travel through the portal that a &gt; &gt; box MAY produce then\nit stands to reason it is possible that it can &gt; &gt; be a dark entity.&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as fear goes, I agree wholeheartedly, fear definitely\nfeeds &gt; &gt; the negative. And that is my point. The protection ritual\ndoes not &gt; &gt; create a relative tangible barrier, it is simply a\nmetaphoric symbol &gt; &gt; of putting your mind in the right place so as\nnot to feed this &gt; &gt; negative energy.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the protection we\nreceive from our tech/guides on the other side &gt; &gt; in my belief is\nvery real, I believe they do actually run &gt; &gt; interference for us as\nfar as negativity goes and the part of the &gt; &gt; ritual where we invoke\ntheir help is just a form of respect and &gt; &gt; acknowledgement that they\nare constantly watching out for us.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this being said, Of course\neveryone will adhere to their own beliefs &gt; &gt; as far as this subject\nis concerned. I just felt that your response &gt; &gt; was a little strong\nand came more from the attitude that I also &gt; &gt; suffer from that is to\nsay &quot; negative spirit yeah bring it on&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But that is not a\nlogical thought out approach to an existing concern.&gt; &gt; So make the\nritual available for anyone that wants to use it and the &gt; &gt;\nexperienced information to go with it.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My most important\nconcern is the welfare and teaching and eventual &gt; &gt; success of new\nresearcher and this research as a whole.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;!--&gt; &gt; #ygrp-mkp{&gt; border:1px solid\n#d8d8d8;font-family:Arial;margin:14px0px;padding:0px 14px;}&gt; #ygrp-mkp\nhr{&gt; border:1px solid #d8d8d8;}&gt; #ygrp-mkp\n#hd{&gt;color:#628c2a;font-size:85%;font-weight:bold;line-height:122%;margin:10px0px;}&gt;\n#ygrp-mkp #ads{&gt; margin-bottom:10px;}&gt; #ygrp-mkp .ad{&gt; padding:0 0;}&gt;\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a{&gt; color:#0000ff;text-decoration:none;}&gt; --&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&lt;!--&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc{&gt; font-family:Arial;}&gt; #ygrp-sponsor\n#ygrp-lc #hd{&gt; margin:10px\n0px;font-weight:bold;font-size:78%;line-height:122%;}&gt; #ygrp-sponsor\n#ygrp-lc .ad{&gt; margin-bottom:10px;padding:0 0;}&gt; --&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;!--&gt; &gt;\n#ygrp-mlmsg {font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica,\nclean,sans-serif;}&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg table {font-size:inherit;font:100%;}&gt;\n#ygrp-mlmsg select, input, textarea {font:99% arial, helvetica,clean,\nsans-serif;}&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg pre, code {font:115% monospace;}&gt;\n#ygrp-mlmsg * {line-height:1.22em;}&gt; #ygrp-text{&gt;\nfont-family:Georgia;&gt; }&gt; #ygrp-text p{&gt; margin:0 0 1em 0;}&gt;\n#ygrp-tpmsgs{&gt; font-family:Arial;&gt; clear:both;}&gt; #ygrp-vitnav{&gt;\npadding-top:10px;font-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;margin:0;}&gt;\n#ygrp-vitnav a{&gt; padding:0 1px;}&gt; #ygrp-actbar{&gt;\nclear:both;margin:25px0;white-space:nowrap;color:#666;text-align:right;}&gt;\n#ygrp-actbar .left{&gt; float:left;white-space:nowrap;}&gt;\n.bld{font-weight:bold;}&gt; #ygrp-grft{&gt;\nfont-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;padding:15px 0;}&gt; #ygrp-ft{&gt;\nfont-family:verdana;font-size:77%;border-top:1px solid #666;&gt;\npadding:5px 0;&gt; }&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg #logo{&gt; padding-bottom:10px;}&gt; &gt;\n#ygrp-vital{&gt; background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:2px\n0 8px 8px;}&gt; #ygrp-vital\n#vithd{&gt;font-size:77%;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;color:#333;text-transform:uppercase;}&gt;\n#ygrp-vital ul{&gt; padding:0;margin:2px 0;}&gt; #ygrp-vital ul li{&gt;\nlist-style-type:none;clear:both;border:1px solid #e0ecee;&gt; }&gt;\n#ygrp-vital ul li\n.ct{&gt;font-weight:bold;color:#ff7900;float:right;width:2em;text-align:right;padding-right:.5em;}&gt;\n#ygrp-vital ul li .cat{&gt; font-weight:bold;}&gt; #ygrp-vital a{&gt;\ntext-decoration:none;}&gt; &gt; #ygrp-vital a:hover{&gt;\ntext-decoration:underline;}&gt; &gt; #ygrp-sponsor #hd{&gt;\ncolor:#999;font-size:77%;}&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov{&gt; padding:6px\n13px;background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;}&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov\nul{&gt; padding:0 0 0 8px;margin:0;}&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov li{&gt;\nlist-style-type:square;padding:6px 0;font-size:77%;}&gt; #ygrp-sponsor\n#ov li a{&gt; text-decoration:none;font-size:130%;}&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #nc{&gt;\nbackground-color:#eee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:0 8px;}&gt;\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad{&gt; padding:8px 0;}&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad\n#hd1{&gt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#628c2a;font-size:100%;line-height:122%;}&gt;\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad a{&gt; text-decoration:none;}&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad\na:hover{&gt; text-decoration:underline;}&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad p{&gt;\nmargin:0;}&gt; o{font-size:0;}&gt; .MsoNormal{&gt; margin:0 0 0 0;}&gt; #ygrp-text\ntt{&gt; font-size:120%;}&gt; blockquote{margin:0 0 0 4px;}&gt;\n.replbq{margin:4;}&gt; --&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n__________________________________________________________&gt; Be a\nbetter friend, newshound, and &gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
