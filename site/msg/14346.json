Has option to =\r\nslow the recording down. Another nice feature is that you can use either a =\r\nhighpass or lowpass filter (sometimes that is all that is needed) and chang=\r\ning the PITCH is a very handy tool. Always KEEP an original copy of your re=\r\ncordings. I just save a copy from inside audacity (to desktop or somewhere)=\r\n then I will start my work on trying to clear it up. Save the original (and=\r\n proceeding enhanced version(s) by using the &quot;file&quot; button at to left corne=\r\nr oif program. There you would SAVE &quot;selection&quot; as MP3.(To upload to here) =\r\nor save to WAV (is bigger) but higher qulity. Can always convert the wav to=\r\n mp3 from withing audacity also. *you will need to get the mps &quot;pluging&quot; fr=\r\nom the website, and follow the information to install it &quot;manually&quot; (once i=\r\ns only needed) that way you get the mp3 converter program free. But really.=\r\n..Audacity is a pretty good program to have round. Has a nice &quot;undo&quot; fesatu=\r\nre too, if you make a mistake.

Has option to slow the \n  recording down. Another nice fe=\r\nature is that you can use either a highpass or \n  lowpass filter (sometimes=\r\n that is all that is needed) and changing the PITCH \n  is a very handy tool=\r\n. Always KEEP an original copy of your recordings. I just \n  save a copy fr=\r\nom inside audacity (to desktop or somewhere) then I will start \n  my work o=\r\nn trying to clear it up. Save the original (and proceeding enhanced \n  vers=\r\nion(s) by using the &quot;file&quot; button at to left corner oif program. There you =\r\n\n  would SAVE &quot;selection&quot; as MP3.(To upload to here) or save to WAV (is big=\r\nger) \n  but higher qulity. Can always convert the wav to mp3 from withing a=\r\nudacity \n  also. *you will need to get the mps &quot;pluging&quot; from the website, =\r\nand follow the \n  information to install it &quot;manually&quot; (once is only needed=\r\n) that way you get \n  the mp3 converter program free. But really...Audacity=\r\n is a pretty good program \n  to have round. Has a nice &quot;undo&quot; fesature too,=\r\n if you make a mistake.

Sure-I could probably &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; matrix \n  some in, but that is all it would be.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; For an EVP to \n  be considered proof positive of spirit communi=\r\ncation by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; community at large, it has to be cl=\r\near enough that many people hear the \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; same thing, without h=\r\nints or coaxing. If you have to have high \n  quality &lt;BR&gt;&gt; devices &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; to make it out, it just isn&#39;t good \n  enough. That does not mean i=\r\nt isn&#39;t a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; true EVP, just that it \n  isn&#39;t good enough to stan=\r\nd as evidence.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As for the \n  whistle, it sounded=\r\n like feedback to me as well, but I will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; have \n  to take you =\r\nword for it that you were no where near any other &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  electronics &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; or EMF&#39;s that could contribute to feedback. Even so, \n  if I a=\r\nm trying to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; remain unbiased and objective, there is no way \n =\r\n for me to say this is a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; spirit, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; without personally =\r\n\n  being with you when you caught it. The only thing I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; can &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; \n  still say about it is could be, but for me it is non conclusive.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If someone does not hear what you are hearing=\r\n, try to remain \n  objective &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; just understand tha=\r\nt it isn&#39;t personal. \n  You have to understand that with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; just=\r\n these recordings alone, \n  there is no way to scientifically prove &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; you have \n  recorded is spirit communication. If you c=\r\nould get consistent, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  intelligent question and answer recor=\r\ndings, then you would be alot &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  closer.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Here again, we are back to the &quot;So what?&quot; \n  thing.
