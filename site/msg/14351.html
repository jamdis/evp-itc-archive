Oops, I might have got my threads in a twist :) using the cell phone has is troubles sometimes. I was direction the use of filters to the RS tape recorder. And I too believe in only "messing" with the original audio "just enough" to clean it up...no more. I guess with my headphone choice, I still need to amp for others though. But then that just brings up the static again :)--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, "April Abercrombie" <april@...> wrote:

As well as the pitch (this changes the voice either higher or lower) that helps bring it out of the "muddy" static level. As far as using the "noise eliminator" be careful here...a little goes a long way. It will make you audio sound like a bad organ piano :) The high or low filter actually does what we are wanting the noise filter to do anyway. And doesn't add its own melodies. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, "April Abercrombie" <april@> wrote:

Another nice feature is that you can use either a highpass or lowpass filter (sometimes that is all that is needed) and changing the PITCH is a very handy tool. Always KEEP an original copy of your recordings. I just save a copy from inside audacity (to desktop or somewhere) then I will start my work on trying to clear it up. Save the original (and proceeding enhanced version(s) by using the "file" button at to left corner oif program. There you would SAVE "selection" as MP3.(To upload to here) or save to WAV (is bigger) but higher qulity. Can always convert the wav to mp3 from withing audacity also. *you will need to get the mps "pluging" from the website, and follow the information to install it "manually" (once is only needed) that way you get the mp3 converter program free. But really...Audacity is a pretty good program to have round. Has a nice "undo" fesature too, if you make a mistake. Happy Hunting ;) Jim H --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@ wrote:
