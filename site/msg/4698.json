There are always going to be people who shoot \n\nit down, attack, etc., but you will find others who experiment with \n\nit, or embrace it, as well.  Nothing that is new (or old) will ever \n\nbe exempt from the attack of others, unless of course one keeps it \n\nhidden in a closet.\n\n\n\nWith this type of ITC, it is ground-breaking IMHO, as the box is \n\nproviding an avenue to &quot;open up the minds&quot; of those whose time has \n\ncome to &quot;hear.&quot;  In other words, I suspect that only a given amount \n\nof people will be open to it; and that will be their time to explore \n\nthe boxes and make contact with spirit.  That is the goal I would \n\nthink: more belief by the populus and especially connection to the \n\nunseen, whatever that may be.\n\n\n\nI just received a nasty e-mail from a TAPS lover attacking Angels & \n\nGhosts because I have written some articles with respect to their \n\nshoddy review of the Shadow Man pic at Moundsville (I am not dogging \n\nTAPS here).  I simply felt what was done by the TV show to the lady \n\nwho took the image was wrong.  I also was attacked as to some of the \n\nEVPs on Angels & Ghosts as being &quot;faked.&quot;  We receive submissions \n\nfrom all over the world and post those that are of interest (photos, \n\nvideos, evp, stories, etc).  The only goal of the site is to post \n\nthat which might cause others to consider the existence of spirit - \n\nthe existence of more beyond the physical realm. Of course, we don&#39;t \n\ntry to post that which we know was faked.  Again pointing others to \n\nconnect spiritually is the idea. \n\n\n\nIs that not what the boxes will be first used for?  I could see many \n\npeople split on this, but the idea of turning more toward the \n\nspiritual (whatever your definition of that is), would be a basic \n\ngoal.  From there, everyone must have their own personal experience \n\nto become a believer, no matter how good the evidence posted from \n\nanyone experimenting with ITC.\n\n\n\nLC\n\nhttp://www.AngelsGh osts.com\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, joel smith &lt;sparky1j41@ ...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;  well ihave to agree here with Bruce that blog was written from \n\nsomeone tthan&#39;s never seen the box or any box in action first hand . \n\nThis is someone who has no experience what so ever in any \n\nresearches  .
