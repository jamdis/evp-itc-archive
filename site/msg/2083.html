<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I firmly believe that the researchers themselves could be the source
of some of the recordings they capture as evps&#x27; There have been a
couple of cases where the voice of the evp matches the person who was
recording it but i don&#x27;t think the voice has to match. 

In an investigation I was present for in California, one investigator
was cussed at in his own voice when recording an evp.

In another case by Indiana Ghost Trackers, an evp was recorded which
was a statement made by one of the investigators while being video
taped an hour after the evp was captured. In other words, there was
some time slippage that resulted in an evp being made an hour before
the actual words were spoken by the investigator.

I thing this phenomena is not the way the Box works however.

p.s. the famous case of thoughtography (an image appearing on film
that may originate in someones mind) is the subject of study of a man
named Ted Serios.

&gt; I think it&#x27;s very possible.  They say there are people who can
project images onto film with their mind, so I don&#x27;t know why it
couldn&#x27;t happen with EVP&#x27;s also..

&gt; What does everyone think about the theory that some EVP&#x27;s are 
&gt; generated by the human brain? Could this be possible?
