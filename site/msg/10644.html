Ok, another question if anyone will be so kind to answer.  This is for reso=
nance inside the box(hence the name echo chamber) correct?  

So things I p=
ossibly need to take into consideration when building mine are:
a.  Types o=
f material provide better results, copper and aluminum versus materials tha=
t absorb/dampen such as egg crate foam or cloth lining.
b.  Size of box (le=
ngth, width, height) to produce the suspected resonance frequency.
c.  Amou=
nt of chambers (I noticed 3 is the magical number )  Having chambers increa=
ses the resonance effect more than just having an empty box without chamber=
s.  
d.  Outside influence such as air which is why Frank mentioned it need=
ing to be air-tight
e.  The types of outside influence is from the spirits =
getting to the inside.  So is it or is it not a good idea to wrap the box i=
n absorbing/dampening materials since they are manipulating the sound insid=
e a box?  I wouldn't think that it would matter what's on the outside as lo=
ng as noise from the outside isn't bombarding the outsides of the box causi=
ng internal problems and distorting anything.

Pardon my thought process, b=
ut I'm just trying to learn the concepts here.  So if I am way of base, wil=
l someone please let me know.  :)

Thanks,
Bryan

This is for the echo chambers right?  Can someone give me a link=
 to more details about how it works?

Is it that you put the mic on one end=
, the speaker on the other, and the sounds mix throughout the chamber to fo=
rm words from the speaker to the mic?

Thanks for any and all help
Bryan

 I didn't have enough copper clad=
 board, so used some copper sheet, and you can see where I spliced one of t=
he channel dividers. Just have to be air tight.
