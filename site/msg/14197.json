A rough example w=\r\nould be if it found &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot; in a file 20 times, it could replace a=\r\nll the occurances with say $HN1.

It will not sound exactly the same as the original wav. file. How mu=\r\nch it differs depends on the size of the file you are attaching. If it is a=\r\n very large file, it will sound much different.\n\n                          =\r\n      The only exception to this is if the wav. file is small enough that t=\r\nhe filtering process will ignore it. It has to be pretty small though, like=\r\n under 1 MB (I am not exactly sure of the threshold).\n\n                    =\r\n            The best way to share files over the internet if you want them =\r\nas close to the original as possible is to upload them directly to a websit=\r\ne.\n\n                                ----- Original Message ----- \n         =\r\n                       From: Rj \n                                To: EVP-IT=\r\nC@yahoogroups .com \n                                Sent: Sunday, May 10, 2=\r\n009 10:54 AM\n                                Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File up=\r\nloading rules\n\n\n\n                                Pixelization doesn&#39;t clean=\r\n-up the data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a picture of a field of flowe=\r\nrs, and beginning to add levels or pixelization to the picture.  Soon, you =\r\nwould not be able to tell there were flowers there at all.  You would see a=\r\n lot of colored blocks.\n\n                                Or in the other di=\r\nrection, imagine you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on=\r\n your screen: a complete screen of truely random static snow.  Pixelizing t=\r\nhis, after a while, you would again start to see colored blocks.\n\n         =\r\n                       What&#39;s happening is that it is processing an area of=\r\n the image, taking (for instance) the average value of that entire area, an=\r\nd replacing all the blocks in that area with the average.  In video process=\r\ning, this would result in a field of multi-colored flowers being replaced b=\r\ny, for instance, a big greyish-bluish block, with no resemblance to flowers=\r\n.  In the noise example, it maybe replace all the random pixels with anothe=\r\nr big greyish-bluish block.  If you did not know beforehand what the origin=\r\nal picture was, you couldn&#39;t tell whether your pixelized image was really a=\r\n field of flowers, a chevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixel=\r\ns.\n\n                                It works the same with the sound files.=\r\n  Taking something as complex as speech, and replacing frequencies with the=\r\nir averages, loses the speech the farther you go, until you head strange fl=\r\nuctuating square waves.  Doing the same to random static will eventually pr=\r\noduce the same thing.  And random fluctuating square waves can sound a bit =\r\nlike speech - or at least, you could have fun sharing with each other what =\r\nyou thing they &#39;sound like&#39;.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                --- On Su=\r\nn, 5/10/09, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                  =\r\n              From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt;\n                   =\r\n             Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n                  =\r\n              To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n                                =\r\nDate: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 9:29 AM\n\n\n                                I alw=\r\nays save the whole file in wav format then do my clips as mp3.

While some formats (like wav) c=\r\nan store the audio very close to the way it was recorded, formats like mp3 =\r\ncompress the file, and in so doing lose some of the sonic details.  This ma=\r\ny not be a big deal in music, where the audio is fairly clear to begin with=\r\n.  But with sound sources with a lot of noise (like evps), this can not onl=\r\ny obscure any real sounds, but pixelize non-sounds (like white noise) and m=\r\nake them start to sound like speech.\n\n                                So mp=\r\n3 might be good for sharing the data, once you&#39;ve already formed an opinion=\r\n based on an analysis of the wav file.
