I can remember a time when=\r\n you publicly came out against any type of money making using your boxes an=\r\nd even refused moon when he wanted to manufacture and sell them for large p=\r\nrofits yet now you condone\n his robbery of innocent unaware people and actu=\r\nally act foolish on his behest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Frank you are better than this, just=\r\n concentrate on developing a better box and forget about moon and his trick=\r\ns and lies, he is finished in the paranormal and he knows it, everyone is w=\r\nise to his game and he is practically an outcast.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Frank you are hitc=\r\nhing you wagon to a dead horse. Get away from these bad influences before t=\r\nhey ruin your reputation as well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We have had this moon discussion i=\r\nn the past and once he has exhausted his need for you he will screw you aga=\r\nin like he has done so many times before.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Frank, I like and respect =\r\nyou and I hope you will consider what I have said in this e-mail and I sinc=\r\nerely hope you post this one on the evp-itc group. I will be posting it on =\r\nmy group and others I belong to.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your former friend&lt;BR&gt;Bruce&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQU=\r\nOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial, san-serif; COLO=\r\nR: black&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HR&gt;\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x12213541=\r\n45x1201369495/aol?redir=3Dhttp:%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fclk%3B215221161%3=\r\nB37268813%3By&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;Limited Time Offers: Save big=\r\n on popular laptops at Dell&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dh5&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-1781841561-1244217981=:32178--"}
