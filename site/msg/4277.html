<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Absolutely Kristin. As I said, my purpose was to clear up any
misconceptions about my honesty. I think anyone would have done the
same. Although I think it&#x27;s funny that the truth gets a &quot;can we drop
it now?&quot; comment. I don&#x27;t require or desire any apologies or any
replies to my post. I know that it will be read and knowing that
maybe, just maybe, someone will stop and consider the truth is enough
for me. After all, we are nothing if not honest.
Have a great day everyone and get back to work!

&gt; I wanted to edit and add the following to my previous post but... Here
&gt; is a blatant lie by Rick Moran in an obvious attempt to discredit him.
&gt; This is from the same article...
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;There appears to be some controversy surrounding Frank&#x27;s Box and
&gt; Christopher Moon, who is the publisher of Haunted Times Magazine, a
&gt; relative of George and Cathy Lutz of Amityville infamy...
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, Christopher Moon is not now, nor will he ever be a close or
&gt; distant relative of the Lutz family. Mr. Moran lays claim to debunking
&gt; the Amityville claims and says the entire &quot;case&quot; was a fraud. Now, he
&gt; attempts to tie Christopher Moon to the supposed fraud. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now remember, this is the researcher you are supporting.

&gt; &gt; A few weeks ago I posted that Rick Moran had written an article
&gt; &gt; stating that children and high school students would be part of the
&gt; &gt; testing subjects of the mini-box. Later that day the article was
&gt; &gt; replaced with a different article about the mini-box. I was told that
&gt; &gt; I was stating mis truths. I wasn&#x27;t. I finally was able to locate the
&gt; &gt; missing article. I&#x27;m providing a link to the entire article along with
&gt; &gt; the statement regarding our children. If the link somehow becomes
&gt; &gt; unavailable, I have done a screen shot and will provide it to whoever
&gt; &gt; asks.
&gt; &gt; Believe me when I say that this isn&#x27;t to cause or stir crap. I was
&gt; &gt; basically called a liar and this clears up that misconception. If I am
&gt; &gt; banned from this group for telling the truth, than so be it. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &quot;...it was not the question of whether the phenomenon existed to begin
&gt; &gt; with, but rather what is the phenomenon. That will require a good
&gt; &gt; deal more effort to explore and beginning in January we will be
&gt; &gt; undertaking test sessions all over north and east Texas as well as
&gt; &gt; other national locations with a wide variety of folks to see what
&gt; &gt; happens within the group dynamic. The testing will include folks who
&gt; &gt; are both believers and non-believers, skeptics, critics, other
&gt; &gt; researchers, children, high school students, college and grad
&gt; &gt; students, and senior citizens to name a few categories.&quot;
