I&#39;ll check it out.\n\nAs an afterthought, to share this information I decided to probably put\ntogether a video production of this entire event.\n\nFrom UFO Geek Paradoc Productions...  the paranormal documentary, &quot;Final\ncommunication from a fatal flight&quot;, or something like that.  I decided\nto start this during my vacation break later this month.\nI&#39;ll even travel to the plane crash site point of impact, as well as\nperforming sessions with the debris in my lab.\n\nI&#39;ve heard that wires sometime retain imprinted information or\ncommunication (like those old wire recorders).\nSome of the wire bundle I have may have contained communication or\nelectrical pulses just before the crash.\n\nThis video will be the perfect time to test some of the paranormal\nprototypes, as well as a new one I designed, but haven&#39;t shared yet.\nIt&#39;s an ITC System design that uses bright light, mirrors, lenses, along\nwith an optical coupler and a few other surprises.\n\nI have enough researched information and items to work with to put\ntogether an hour long or more documentary.\nI&#39;ll have to see if Youtube will let me put more than 10 minutes at a\ntime on their servers, otherwise I&#39;ll have to break it up into parts.\n\nThis will all be new to me, but it&#39;s worth the attempt.\n\n- Mike C.

Just\ngoogle it.\n&gt;...\n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: M.A. Coletta (Mike) michaelcoletta@...&gt;\n&gt; Greetings fellow researchers,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Okay... on with my story.\n&gt; While sitting in my hotel room last week I continued to read one of\n&gt; Sarah Estep&#39;s books. In one of the chapters she writes about the plane\n&gt; crash into the Potomac River, which happened a number of years ago.\nMany\n&gt; people died when the airplane went into that frozen river, and she\n&gt; explains how she and others began receiving messages from the crash\n&gt; victims at almost the exact time time crash occurred, even though she\n&gt; didn&#39;t know about the crash at the time.\n&gt;\n&gt; She then writes about the crash of two jumbo jets, where hundreds lost\n&gt; their lives instantly, or soon after the accident. And how the spirit\n&gt; world was filled with communication because of this large disaster.\n&gt;\n&gt; That got me thinking...\n&gt;\n&gt; I too have always been super sensitive about deadly plane crashes,\n&gt; feeling for the families of the victims, as well as, and especially\nfor\n&gt; the victims themselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; One crash in particular put me into the extensive research mode about\n&gt; the crash and the victims. So-much-so that I contacted the wife of the\n&gt; plane&#39;s pilot, where I was able to help put some closure into her\nworld\n&gt; after a number of contacts. (Not wanting to discuss too much, let me\n&gt; just say I was able to view things she was not allowed to view. And\n&gt; after doing so I was able to describe things to her that she always\n&gt; wondered about.)\n&gt;\n&gt; The commercial aircraft in question crashed so violently that remains\nof\n&gt; the passengers were never all recovered. And after years of legal\n&gt; battling, the settlements were made and the entire aircraft wreckage\nwas\n&gt; released to a salvage company.\n&gt; I was there, at the warehouse, when the many trucks left with the many\n&gt; pieces of plane, enroute to their salvage yard. And while there I\n&gt; talked with the attorney and investigative lead, who were both\non-scene\n&gt; to over-see the finalization of this effort.\n&gt;\n&gt; To get off topic for a bit, I for one am of the opinion that in the\n&gt; spirit communication world, an object is key if communication with a\n&gt; specific entity is desired. I know many do not agree, and think that\n&gt; open communication is possible anytime, anywhere... but I&#39;m not one of\n&gt; those people.\n&gt;\n&gt; I may be wrong or I may be right, but I think an object or location\nare\n&gt; a must when specific communication is desired. hence, the reason I\nstand\n&gt; next to a certain grave site, or location where a death actually\n&gt; happened, or have a related object in hand or near where a session is\n&gt; being done.\n&gt;\n&gt; Okay... having said that, while I was observing the movement of the\n&gt; plane crash debris, I was offered a small piece or two by those who\nnow\n&gt; owned the salvage material. (No longer in litigation and no longer\nowned\n&gt; by the airline company). I refused acceptance of anything at the time,\n&gt; but asked if the salvage company had, by chance, forgotten something\nin\n&gt; the warehouse or on the grounds, was it okay for a person to possess\nit.\n&gt; They told me, yes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Later that evening, when all the material had been moved out of the\n&gt; warehouse, I once again visited the scene. Looking around I found they\n&gt; had done a very good job at clean-up, only leaving a few pieces of\nsmall\n&gt; metal, wire, paper, and fabric near the large doors.\n&gt;\n&gt; I picked up the few items that were still there and headed toward the\n&gt; large trash container that was on the property, my intensions to drop\n&gt; those items into the trash. But, while holding them I received a very\n&gt; strong feeling, a very emotional sensation that would not allow me to\n&gt; put them in the trash. It was so strong in-fact, that I began crying.\n&gt; It just flowed through me, consuming me as it went.\n&gt;\n&gt; My emotional feeling was just like it had been earlier in the day when\nI\n&gt; placed one hand on one of the engines that were mangled and filled\nwith\n&gt; impacted dirt that was once the ground in the place that became the\n&gt; final resting place.\n&gt;\n&gt; Once I arrived home, I carefully placed the small amount of debris\n&gt; material (metal, wire, carpet fabric, paper, etc.) into a sealed glass\n&gt; canister, where it remains to this day.\n&gt;\n&gt; Where am I going with this story...???\n&gt;\n&gt; Two weeks from now, I have a two week vacation coming... which will be\n&gt; spent at home.\n&gt;\n&gt; After reading Sarah Estep&#39;s book, especially the chapter about the\nplane\n&gt; crash victims, I&#39;ve decided to use those objects I acquired from the\n&gt; warehouse grounds, as the objects that may help me make some specific\n&gt; spirit contacts.\n&gt; I have already researched that crash, and I have all the victims\nnames,\n&gt; along with some information of there life&#39;s. Maybe I will be able to\n&gt; gain information and answer some questions... so I can contact others,\n&gt; besides the original contact with the pilot&#39;s wife, as I told you\nabout\n&gt; earlier in my writing.\n&gt;\n&gt; All I can do is try... and see what happens.\n&gt; - Mike C.
