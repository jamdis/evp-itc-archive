I would say we lost a member of our group but I don't feel she is gone. For=
 those of you who knew Debbie Caruso it may have come as a shock she has pa=
ssed at such a young age. For those of you who didnt get the chance to know=
 her it truly is your loss. Such a sweet generous soul, a great friend, lov=
ing mother, wonderful evp-itc researcher. It is comforting to know you are =
with your son again and that the communication is now clear. Much love to a=
ll those who are in pain and my thoughts go out to her friends and family.

Hello,

We have been informed that Debbie C=
aruso, a well-known and liked member and contributor of the ITC community, =
has transitioned to the world of spirit last night. Out thoughts go out to =
her family and friends, and we thank her for long-standing contribution to =
the field of ITC and spirit communication.

We shall not be surprised if we=
 hear of her influence on this field in this physical plane in the future. =
We know she is in loving hands, if our work has taught us anything, that mu=
ch is certainly clear.

Keith Clark
