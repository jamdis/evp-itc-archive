<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>When I click on your link it goes to page with your picture (nice to  
see your face, finally! :) ) and underneath a section called &quot;Files&quot;.  
All of your files are listed with an icon that looks like a square  
with a microphone and a CD. It is the only clickable thing--I can&#x27;t  
click the title of the clip, for example. When I click it, nothing  
ever happens. I looks like it is loading but nothing comes of it.

I&#x27;ve had this problem with esnips since it first started up. I have  
never yet been able to get any clip of any length by anyone to ever  
load.

&gt; Okay, Bruce, the job of the day is figure out why I get nothing  
&gt; when I click on the icon. I can&#x27;t.

&gt; Very sad

&gt;
&gt; Yes all the files are recent, and yes your ear is gettting better.
&gt; But the quality of the files will vary according to the conditions  
&gt; at the time of the session.

&gt; I think it works great.  Are these all recent?  Either your  
&gt; recordings are getting better by the moment or my hearing is  
&gt; improving, because they sound amazingly clear to me.
