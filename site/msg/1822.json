I got alot more quality from the other way. And it continued on for quite a long period in parts. This way is too fragmented for my ears to make out everything, just bits and peices.\n  You are right it cuts down on alot of the noise but I think they manipulate the noise and static so it plays a role for my recordings using radio methods. Use whatever sounds best for your ears tho if you will be using it.\n  Misty\n\n       \n---------------------------------\nSick sense of humor? Visit Yahoo!
