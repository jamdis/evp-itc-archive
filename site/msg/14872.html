&gt;   Wow first of all dont swear on here and wind your neck in!
&gt;
&gt; Now I have to admit I didnt mean you I was talking about Chris moon but
&gt; hell im at work and im trying to do 2 things at once.
&gt;
&gt; I have been following this group for a year and from the message i wrote
&gt; this is the first time I got a reply. Now Frank I think you work is quality
&gt; and I definately want to learn more about your work and what you do. and if
&gt; you could advise me of where I can see a profile of yourself that would be
&gt; great. but dont start with the abusive crap towards me.
&gt;
&gt; Lets keep it clean. Again I was talking about Moon. not you Frank, iv read
&gt; my message over and i definately worded it wrong. Im just not a big fan of
&gt; Chris Moon.
&gt;
&gt; And the religious crap thing also wind your neck in about that, that was a
&gt; pretty crappy thing first of all im not religious it just causes war. second
&gt; of all I want to know more about your work.

&gt;
&gt;    Arrogant!? Lets see, I don&#x27;t do shows, I&#x27;m not on podcast every
&gt; friggin&#x27; day proclaiming my expertness, I don&#x27;t charge money-for anything, I
&gt; share all information and schematics, and I do not kiss anyone&#x27;s ass, guess
&gt; that must be so egotistical of me.  Arrogant!?, who is the f--- is the
&gt; duffus out there with the high priest mentality?  The really sad part is
&gt; trhe brain dead dorks that follow these clowns. Haliday proclaimed himself
&gt; box expert extraordinaire, and there&#x27;s those sorry twits that eat up
&gt; everyword. There are no box/paranormal experts, no one knows how this shit
&gt; works. Go to church if you want a religious experience!
&gt;
&gt;  Anyway, there is one advantage to using tape, the entities seem capable of
&gt; changing the messages as needed. I can use the same recording over an over,
&gt; and I swear, I get meaningful, having to do with the moment on every
&gt; listening. Brain matrixing--perhaps- -or does it really change? I can&#x27;t
&gt; tell.

&gt;&gt;   Hi All
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have to admit that I share the same opinion as Bruce. I dont what
&gt;&gt; everyones take is on this but I felt that some of moon and even Franks
&gt;&gt; attitude was slightly arrogant. I am a researcher in the UK using old reel
&gt;&gt; to reel methods and obtaining excellent results. I lost some family and some
&gt;&gt; close friends 5 yeara ago and suddenly it dawned on me...what is life all
&gt;&gt; about. I went on to research every evp pioneer i could, listen to hours/days
&gt;&gt; of recordings and it changed my outlook on life. tears were turned to smiles
&gt;&gt; and then I realised what all this research is for. it was a big step for me
&gt;&gt; spiritually.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I dont know if there is anyone else on here using old fashioned methods
&gt;&gt; but if anybody would like to hear recordings please ask. I am using a reel
&gt;&gt; to reel sony &quot;Hi frequency&quot; recorder and trying various types of tones,
&gt;&gt; backgrounds e.t.c.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Good luck to everyone with their research, you are right we are changing
&gt;&gt; history we are discovering new things. if it wasnt for individuals such as
&gt;&gt; raudive, jurghenson to name a few, maybe we wouldnt have discovered this. it
&gt;&gt; takes a brave individual to tackle an arrogant human race blunted with
&gt;&gt; science.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Kind Regards

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; guys,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sorry to burden you with this nonsense but this group and the RTSC group
&gt;&gt; are my only venues to respond to posts on other groups and have my account
&gt;&gt; heard, I hope you do not mind to much.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Here is a copy of my final personal e-mail to Frank Sumption which by the
&gt;&gt; way is meant for him but he see&#x27;s fit to post them publicly in an attempt to
&gt;&gt; discredit me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I want you to read it first hand so there are no chance of it being
&gt;&gt; altered before it is posted else where.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I will not address Frank again
&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Frank,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is getting ridiculous now, you should stop writing these posts, all
&gt;&gt; you are doing is making yourself look ridiculous.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have offered many times to make my raw recordings available for review
&gt;&gt; by anyone who wants them. I have made the same challenge to your friend moon
&gt;&gt; who we all know is behind this tirade he has time and again refused or
&gt;&gt; ignored the request for any type of audio file
&gt;&gt; to be publicly posted for revue and continues to take advantage of
&gt;&gt; innocent unsuspecting people with his con game and charging large amounts of
&gt;&gt; money for sessions where he fabricates and makes up content as he goes
&gt;&gt; along.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I was the only one to confront him in public and expose him for the fake
&gt;&gt; he is and this is his feeble attempt at retaliation. I and other researchers
&gt;&gt; like me have brought this research light years from where it was when you
&gt;&gt; and I first met, moon just continues to use it to rip people off and has not
&gt;&gt; contributed a thing to the research of ghost box communication beside lining
&gt;&gt; his own pockets.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Just the fact that he has you doing his dirty work shows the type of guy
&gt;&gt; he is. I can remember a time when you publicly came out against any type of
&gt;&gt; money making using your boxes and even refused moon when he wanted to
&gt;&gt; manufacture and sell them for large profits yet now you condone his robbery
&gt;&gt; of innocent unaware people and actually act foolish on his behest.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Frank you are better than this, just concentrate on developing a better
&gt;&gt; box and forget about moon and his tricks and lies, he is finished in the
&gt;&gt; paranormal and he knows it, everyone is wise to his game and he is
&gt;&gt; practically an outcast.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Frank you are hitching you wagon to a dead horse. Get away from these bad
&gt;&gt; influences before they ruin your reputation as well.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We have had this moon discussion in the past and once he has exhausted his
&gt;&gt; need for you he will screw you again like he has done so many times before.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Frank, I like and respect you and I hope you will consider what I have
&gt;&gt; said in this e-mail and I sincerely hope you post this one on the evp-itc
&gt;&gt; group. I will be posting it on my group and others I belong to.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Your former friend
&gt;&gt; Bruce
