&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Just wanted to say I got up today and just turned on the RS 20-125 
&gt; &gt; and heard some of them saying &quot; Happy Birthday &quot; to me and it is my 
&gt; &gt; birthday I was shocked to hear that LOL. I also heard someone in 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; background singing &quot; Happy Birthday &quot; too. How cool is that, no 
&gt; &gt; coincidence seems like to me. Here is another story I was watching 
&gt; TV 
&gt; &gt; the Grammy Awards and when Little Richard and Jerry lee Lewis was 
&gt; on 
&gt; &gt; there was another singer with them from Credence Clearwater Revival 
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; couldn&#x27;t remember his name. So as I was listening to the spirits I 
&gt; &gt; heard a voice today say &quot; John Fogerty &quot; is that his name I think 
&gt; it 
&gt; &gt; is? How cool was that ? Oh well just some stuff to ponder on. You 
&gt; all 
&gt; &gt; have a great evening.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt;
