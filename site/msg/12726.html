<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting revelation. A man does legitimate research, backs it up 
with data, and he is called a moron.

This is a very open minded approach. They thought this way in the 
dark ages when they burned women for witchcraft.

A closed mind can see no light.

&gt; &gt; Chris Moon and his use of Franks Box gets slammed
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Last night on Coast to Coast AM George Noory had Dr. Stephen Rorke
&gt; &gt; on-air.  He discussed the field of instrumental transcommunication
&gt; &gt; (ITC), his study of the Spiricom case, Frank&#x27;s Box, and EVP 
&gt; capture.
&gt; &gt; It was during his discussion of Frank&#x27;s Box where he brought up 
&gt; the name
&gt; &gt; Chris Moon.  He also brought up exactly what he thought of Chris 
&gt; Moon&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; use of the Franks Box he calls his telephone to the dead.
&gt; &gt; Better than writng about it, I&#x27;ve placed a link to the audio from 
&gt; last
&gt; &gt; night, at my post below.
