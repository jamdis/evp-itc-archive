Thanks for the link and the information.

In any field, different people ca=
n bring different things of value to the research.=A0 Some, like you I thin=
k, bring electrical engineering knowledge, and creativity.=A0 Some others h=
ere bring a willingness to explore in many different locales and conditions=
.=A0 I myself try to bring process and methodology to the mix.=A0 So I hope=
 you don't think I am attacking what you bring, by presenting what I bring.=
=A0 I think progress is best made in any field by taking the best of what p=
eople bring, and finding ways to use them together.
