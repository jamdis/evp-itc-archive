I have\nthis woman that shows up in towels, always just half the face. Perahps you\nare being too critical? As with all spirit messages, it&#39;s what it means to\nthe experiencer that matters.

I am going to have\n&gt; to see a larger sample size before I determine if what you have witnessed is\n&gt; in fact a form or not.  I cannot accept an image as paranormal without\n&gt; knowing where it sits among the bulk of audio files.  If every file has\n&gt; multiple faces, the I would have  to say that there is nothing there.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, I will certainly keep testing with my copy and hopefully something will\n&gt; really pop for me.  I have run through about ten files (EVP and GBC) so far\n&gt; for intensive study and I still haven&#39;t got anything that I would consider a\n&gt; positive hit.  I need an actual formed face, not portions thereof, to\n&gt; consider an image real.  This is the only way to discount visual matrixing.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have high hopes for this though!\n&gt;\n&gt; Tim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Dec 18, 2010 at 5:01 AM, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Tim did you see my images???\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- On *Sat, 12/18/10, Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@gmail.com&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From: Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: ok so im getting stuff on the spectergram\n&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; Date: Saturday, December 18, 2010, 3:26 AM\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have Audition as my editor.

It was really compelling to see letters and numbers,\n&gt;&gt; not images or pictures, but partial words appear in the graph. At first it\n&gt;&gt; was I thought it was a software glitch but it is a repeatable event. It was\n&gt;&gt; on LiveSciFi which is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was some kind\n&gt;&gt; of code error but it happened on more than one webcast.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So if anyone has Audition, just feed Box output right in your computer and\n&gt;&gt; see what happens. I wanted to try it tonight but I have Audacity and the\n&gt;&gt; spectragraph feature doesn&#39;t have that shaded appearance that Audition does\n&gt;&gt; so it&#39;s not able to render images or characters, at least as far as I see\n&gt;&gt; using the various settings.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt;&gt; Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have tried numerous EVP files and short box clips and so far\n&gt;&gt; &gt; nothing discernible has appeared on either program.
