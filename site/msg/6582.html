Jeremy,
 
Juli is right, it is very helpfull to have your questions though=
t out before a session especially if the session is pertaining to a certain=
 topic.
 
If you wing it, like juli said you will tend to speed up and over=
lap the next question with the previous answer and then you think you did 
=
not recieve a response so you ask the same question again. I had this happe=
n a few day's ago and when I repeated the question my tech's
mike and lisa =
both said "AGAIN" they start to lose patience sometimes, but you have to re=
member to them we must be like dealing with kindergarten children.
