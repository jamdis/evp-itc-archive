Nellie,
 
Thank you for posting that.  Atleast I feel like I am not the only one  now.  
Maybe we should make a bumper sticker of what you said about ghosts  and sent 
it to A & E.  Would they get the idea?
 
Jeff

I'm  on a forum with the mother of one of the kids.  She says that it is 
real,  but there are some issues on the production end.  Basically any attempts  
at the technical side of investigation gets cut.  The kids aren't used to  
being on camera, so you do see a lot of retakes that seem rehearsed.  She  was 
also not thrilled that they chose to emphasize so much demonic stuff right  off 
the bat.  That was way out of balance.

No, I was also howling over that.  So  talking to dead people is bad, eh?  
Maybe I should take their word for it  that all dead people are nasty, negative 
entities, as well.  This kind of  thing drives me nuts.  Repeat after me, A&E: 
Ghosts are people,  too!
