Since there are different distinct claims about what the\n&gt; box or the recorders can do, I try to make different distinct experiments\n&gt; for each.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some people claim they can get the box to tell them things that the\n&gt; operator couldn&#39;t know, so my &quot;whats the object&quot; experiment is one way to\n&gt; examine that.  Some people claim the boxes can make predictions, so\n&gt; cataloging predictions and examining the results can help examine that.  If\n&gt; there are other claims, I will try to figure experiments based on those.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Sat, 8/21/10, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@gmail.com&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Scamp,\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, August 21, 2010, 12:48 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  I get our last dogs from time to time, and used to get them via white\n&gt; noise when I first started this. Last summer some kids came down into the\n&gt; basement wiht the younger grandson, and the little yorkie barked, but &quot;get\n&gt; outta here&quot; came out, some how.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Yeah, I think I was too hard on RJ. I don&#39;t know why, but testing doens&#39;t\n&gt; seem to work, but we get enough to prove this to ourselves.

I&#39;d know that bark anywhere.  Sorry, that I\n&gt; can&#39;t make it any clearer, I need to get one of those better ghost boxes I\n&gt; guess.  RJ, spirits are just like us, they are not omnipresent like\n&gt; God,  probably why David doesn&#39;t want to play the guessing game, he has\n&gt; better things to do over there, and has said, they have thousands of people\n&gt; standing in this long line waiting to get into the Heavens, and He can&#39;t\n&gt; just drop His job and go to your house to see what you have over there, He\n&gt; did tell me that first time what it was, and i sent it to you, but it was\n&gt; too late.  It&#39;s hard for me to understand them sometimes, He was also right\n&gt; about that little boy, Syler being killed, and where his body would be\n&gt; found, I don&#39;t know what they did about it though. sf\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI you comple ely igno e wha e e yone else in he whole wide eaking wo ld ge s ia EVP, a ious pho og aphy and ITC me hods, and jus chance encoun e s, hen yeah, you p obably don' ha e any da a, and won' ha e any da a no ma e wha . \n\n \nF-S\nOn Sa , Aug 21, 2010 a 3:42 PM, Rick Weg zyn ickweg zyn@...> w o e:\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nHey RJ,I hink we need o go o he ceme a y and see wha you ge he e....\n\n\n\nF om: Rj as e e @...> \nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoog oups.comSen : Sa , Augus 21, 2010 2:29:36 PM \nSubjec : Re: [EVP-ITC] Scamp,\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nI don' hink I ha e enough da a ye o make any conclusions, so I plan mo e expe imen s.  Since he e a e di e en dis inc claims abou wha he box o he eco de s can do, I y o make di e en dis inc expe imen s o each.\nSome people claim hey can ge he box o ell hem hings ha he ope a o couldn' know, so my \"wha s he objec \" expe imen is one way o examine ha .  Some people claim he boxes can make p edic ions, so ca aloging p edic ions and examining he esul s can help examine ha .  I he e a e o he claims, I will y o igu e expe imen s based on hose.\n--- On Sa , 8/21/10, F ank Sump ion pu plealiengi l@...> w o e:\nF om: F ank Sump ion pu plealiengi l@...>Subjec : Re: [EVP-ITC] Scamp,To: EVP-ITC@yahoog oups.com\nDa e: Sa u day, Augus 21, 2010, 12:48 PM\n  \n\n\n I ge ou las dogs om ime o ime, and used o ge hem ia whi e noise when I i s s a ed his.
