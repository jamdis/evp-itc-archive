Ok, guys David says this guy is "very bad" he claims to be JC, but of  
course he is not.  And he is probably form what David the Tech says, the  guy 
may very well be the "false prophet," although he makes his claim to be JC  
only is using a different name.  Please be careful everyone, Israel is  
already fighting with mobs of Muslims starting up a nasty war with them as I am  
typing this, I don't know if I should even post this link about this false  
prophet, but you folks are smart people and won't fall for it, your angels 
will  protect you all from these false prophets and false leaders.  David 
wanted  me to turn it off, he said it is an "antichrist spirit and false 
prophet,  and he's very bad."  This false person will "address the world May 22, 
here  is the link, this is NOT Jesus, so please be careful everyone, I 
hesitate to  even post it.  Stay safe,   sf
