<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Here&#x27;s what you need to know, Zack:

The scan rate can only be increased by about 10%, because the radio&#x27;s 
internal scan rate is not over-ridden. Pulsing the Input at a higher 
rate than 90% of the internal clock is seen as a constant button push.

Hope that helps...

&gt; I can write my own assembler for it.  What is the preferred scan 
rate 
&gt; (in scans/second)?

Either

the
&gt; &gt; boys who offered the first one bring it back to market.

A
&gt; &gt; couple more questions
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The chip is a microcontroller. It needs a program
&gt; &gt; called &quot;firmware&quot; put into it before it will do anything useful. 
The
&gt; &gt; chips have a program memory which comes blank when you buy
&gt; &gt; them.The &quot;code&quot; is the representation of what is called machine
&gt; &gt; language that tells the various parts of the microcontroller what 
to
&gt; &gt; do. In this case, I imagine it increases a voltage with a certain
&gt; &gt; pattern and then drops it down to zero, starting over again and
&gt; &gt; repeating at a certain rate. This would produce a repetitive 
sweep of
&gt; &gt; the radio at a certain rate when the microcontroller is hooked up 
to
&gt; &gt; the radio correctly.It wouldn&#x27;t be difficult for me to write my 
own
&gt; &gt; program to do this with a PIC microcontroller, but if someone else
&gt; &gt; has already done it, why bother?If I can&#x27;t get my hands on the
&gt; &gt; machine code, I&#x27;ll write some myself.ZackOn Fri, 4 Jan 2008,

&gt; &gt; wrote:&gt; Frank, please let me know if you should, for whatever 
reason,
&gt; &gt; decide&gt; to sell that chip (to control the scan rate of the &#x27;469). 
I&#x27;d
&gt; &gt; like&gt; to purchase it from you, if possible.&gt;&gt; Thanks,&gt;&gt; Sharon&gt;&gt; 
P.S.
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve read the follow-ups to my initial question and being a&gt; 
layman
&gt; &gt; at modifying electric apparatuses, what do you all mean by&gt; code?
&gt; &gt; Does one need the code and the chip in order to speed up the&gt;
&gt; &gt; scanning on a hacked &#x27;469; or can one do it with simply a code, 
or&gt;
&gt; &gt; the chip, alone?&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption
&gt; &gt; &lt;franks-boxes@&gt;&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, the guy that first made the 
hack
&gt; &gt; was giving away a chip to&gt; control the scan rate. I don&#x27;t know if
&gt; &gt; it&#x27;s still available. I have&gt; one of the chips, and no &#x27;469.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt; &gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s the&gt; problem with noise reduction methods, they tend 
to
&gt; &gt; take out voices. I&gt; think if I used the muffled sound consistently
&gt; &gt; they would talk&gt; through it though, the goal being to get higher
&gt; &gt; level voices, and&gt; audio. The clarifier is just a low pass filter
&gt; &gt; that can be adjusted--&gt; just an idea.&gt; I have some female guides 
that
&gt; &gt; speak sometimes, and&gt; there&#x27;s the seven sisters that come though
&gt; &gt; sometimes, but I don&#x27;t&gt; know much about that. &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt; &gt; &gt; To:

[EVP-

&gt; &gt; instructions, it doesn&#x27;t sound too&gt; difficult for me so I&#x27;ll give 
it
&gt; &gt; a shot. &gt; &gt; By the way, I did listen&gt; to your tone control clip.
&gt; &gt; Since I&#x27;m new to this my comments are&gt; probably not &quot;worth&quot; much 
at
&gt; &gt; this point. I thought the entire clip&gt; itself was a lot smoother 
and
&gt; &gt; clearer than most I&#x27;ve heard so far&gt; from various sources (the 
mixed
&gt; &gt; station sounds are in smaller pieces&gt; so for someone like me it 
would
&gt; &gt; be easier to pick out the EVPs as&gt; opposed to entire words from 
radio
&gt; &gt; announcers). The short piece about&gt; 2/3 of the way through, where 
I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; guessing you used a clarifier,&gt; sounded muffled to me, which 
makes me
&gt; &gt; think it would also muffle the&gt; EVPs. Definitely easier on the 
ears
&gt; &gt; but for someone inexperienced&gt; (and I seem to be the only one 
here!)
&gt; &gt; it seems it would be harder to&gt; pick out the real words too.&gt; &gt; By
&gt; &gt; the way, in listening to the&gt; deluge of clips uploaded last 
night, I
&gt; &gt; can&#x27;t help but notice that the&gt; voices are all men. Just curious -
-
&gt; &gt; is that always the case?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&gt; &gt; Debbie
