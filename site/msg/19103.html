I set my sessions up at no more than 4 questions. I give them 15 seconds to=
 answer, and move to the next question. With the RS-12-469 radio, I get ple=
nty, and it is a bear if you have to go through more than 5 minutes of reco=
rding slice by slice to hear every possible message.

I think Frank said it best when he said it gets=
 tedious with longer sessions. =C2=A0As you do more sessions, you will want=
 to continue conversing with the Others for as long as possible. =C2=A0But,=
 upon playback, careful analysis (with headphones and Adobe Audition) takes=
 me an hour for every 5 minutes. =C2=A0So three sessions a week at 15 minut=
es a session can eat up a lot of time. =C2=A0So I try to keep my home sessi=
ons to 10 minutes or less. =C2=A0There are times when they are not too comm=
unicative and I keep pressing on past 15 minutes and I always dread it when=
 I do because there is so much more to listen to.


In the field, it is a d=
ifferent story. =C2=A0Session times can go from 15 to 40 minutes and leave =
you with a helluva lot of audio to consider. =C2=A0Being very active in inv=
estigations and home sessions can make going over the audio a very dreadful=
 process if you inundate yourself with longer sessions.


So my advice? =C2=
=A0Keep it under ten unless you are getting something fantastic. =C2=A0Also=
, keep a word file on every session file that documents the time and commun=
ication received in the session for future reference. =C2=A0Sometimes peopl=
e and messages come across that I got over a year ago and I would have neve=
r known it if it weren't for the files I keep.


Hope this helps.
