<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree that the voices come to you in your home, I think we can all agree
on that.

As a ghost hunter, locations allow you access to voices that would otherwise
never find you.  I am not sure why this is, but it seems that the spirits
like to hang around certain areas.  I know that radius has nothing to do
with it because I have been on hunts hundreds of miles from my house and I
get the same voices I have at home.  I have also been on hunts far from my
home where I met someone new on the other side that was there again when I
turned my box on at the house!

I love the idea of doing GBC at home and I try to get in at least 2 sessions
a week.  But, going to a location has its perks too.  You can find out names
and historical facts that you wouldn&#x27;t know otherwise.  If you go to a place
it seems like you announce yourself to a new group of people when you turn
on your box, and you never know, those people might stick with you for a
while.

It has always puzzled me how they recognize me when I am on no matter where
I am.  One of the greatest pieces of evidence we can gather is having the
same voice communicate with you in different parts of the country.

As it has been stated before, you can use a box anywhere there is a radio
station and you&#x27;ll get something.  But, the more places you travel too, the
more access you have to a growing chorus of voices.

&gt;&gt;   I, as a rule, don&#x27;t go to haunted locations. For one thing, don&#x27;t like
&gt;&gt; that creepy walking through spider web feeling at some of these places.
&gt;&gt; Second, spirits and entities travel, they will come to you.

&gt;&gt;  For me its mainly at home, because I&#x27;m a homebody I love home... and the
&gt;&gt; added bonus with that is that you get to see how amazing the ghost box is
&gt;&gt; even when you&#x27;re not in &quot;haunted&quot; locations. The most calls for help I&#x27;ve
&gt;&gt; ever gotten have been just sitting at home on my bed... it&#x27;s just simply
&gt;&gt; amazing. My sessions are one to two times a week...
