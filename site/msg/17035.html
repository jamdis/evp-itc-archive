<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Don&#x27;t forget what the group home page says:

&quot;Try not to get too religious, some discussion will be tolerated as long as no one is offended. There is a &quot;banned&quot; button for those that get too obnoxious. I don&#x27;t mind a good argument as long as it&#x27;s not taken too serious, and people get pissed off, or hurt feelings. Try to be considerate of others!&quot;

&gt; &gt; Really good example of paradolia.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Notice how the &#x27;artist&#x27; only marked the areas he wanted that would force it to look like a face.  If the artist had been consistent, it&#x27;s obvious there is a 3rd eye to the right.  But marking that would damage his interpretation, so he left it out.  Even a fourth eye next to the &#x27;nostril&#x27;.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And noticed how he only marked enough of the mouth to make it look like a mouth.  If he followed the shadow, it would damage his interpretation.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And notice how he added &#x27;eyebrows&#x27; only ABOVE the eye, even though, again, if he was consistent, he would have had to mark the same image below the eyes.

&gt; &gt;       &#x27;course, no one else in the  universe will admit to seeing anything. Why bother? Why indeed!?
