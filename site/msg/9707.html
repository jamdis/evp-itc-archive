I tape from the ghost box straight to the cpu, but sometimes you might forget to save it, and sometimes the cpu might turn itself off.

I did my first recorded session last night. All went great except for 
the lousy reception. I didn't realize just how much you miss during a 
real time session when you play back what you recorded. 

I got two different Steve's one sounded Australian and a Mike. I also 
got the number "Seven" I am sure there is lots more there but my 
reception was so bad I can't hear everything.

Also what would be a good digital recorder (relatively cheap) to get 
that you can easily transfer to your computer?

Any help would be appreciated.
