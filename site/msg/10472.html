The following is not directed at anyone:

We could say this very same thing about anything that becomes 
obsessive, thus blaming it on negative entities. Ex: I recently 
heard about a 40 year old man becoming so obsessive with playing a 
video game that he lost his job, his wife and kids, and had to move 
in with his parents! Was it the devil? No, he was just a dumb-ss! 

I would rather suggest it possible that focusing all of one's time 
and attention to this (or anything) will bring negative behavior of 
some sort...hell, watching too much TV, or living on the computer is 
not healthy, I would suspect.

If people want protection, they should first seek having a healthy 
perspective on life in general, and attempt to have a balanced 
lifestyle. I for one think that would solve most all issues for many 
of us. 

I therefore wonder if the "demons" people fear are really creations 
from our own selfish, mis-thinking, obsessive-compulsive lifestyles - 
all self-created for personal gain and self-satisfaction. ;)

There seems to be a similar reaction with systems not made by me--so
