Pareidolia is not psuedo science. It is an actual, proven=
, natural functioning of the brain.

http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Pareido=
lia

Please read this article, and more, if you have any questions about it=
 being psuedo science. I chose the Wikipedia version because I thought it w=
ould be the least offensive to you. Other articles specifically called out =
EVP and other things.

For the record, I don't think all EVP's are due to p=
areidolia.
