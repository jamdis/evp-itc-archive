Here is two more.. LOL.. I need to motivate myself to make the web page. bl=
ahh

Any way.  There was this one Grave that we believed was Elizabeths.  W=
e went over there 3 times and could smell lilacs after awhile.  It wasn't i=
mmediate, it just slowly came upon us. There was nothing around us to creat=
e that odor (not even in the woods), so I'm guessing they were sending it t=
o us. When I say "what are these" I was picking up some of those purple flo=
wers that grow from clover.  They did not produce the scent we were smellin=
g!! It was incredible.  I have experienced this before and to me, it means =
close to the same thing as roses.  A welcoming, of love and peace.
