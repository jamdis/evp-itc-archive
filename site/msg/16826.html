<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Frank,

My name is Monty Crawford, I&#x27;m the son in law to Marcus Leader, whom is
friends with Carly Rose ... whom has shown me the box(s) that you made for
her.

I am curious as to what i need to do to get one of these boxes for research
... we are setting up a book and want to include &quot;franks box&quot; not the radio
shack version of the box that can be made ...

If this is something you can do, please let me know.
