Just the parts for mine are more than $25 bucks, and the \nhack is almost as good, it does the job. \n\n Maybe, if I quit going off on tangents, and just get some boards \nprofessionally done....\n\n I did have a couple boards made last fall for the LA1816, but the \nradio turned out to be just c-r-a-p-p-eee, I just set them aside. \nOne all the wiring is done, and one is just the bare board. They are \nmostly SMT components. If there are some real techno-gurus out \nthere, I don&#39;t have a problem giving these boards away. The AM band \nworks, but it&#39;s kinda noisy, which could be just the wrong choice of \nIF cans, or maybe the RF amp. These are second gen boards for the \nLA1816, the first one I had the pin spacing too close for the radio \nchip. They have RVG, and linear, which also may contribute to noise. \nRandy Schnieder has one of these, that was 25,  now I can&#39;t remember \nwhat I did with 26, the ones I have on hand would be 28, and as yet \nan unassigned number.

Hell I could only wish to \nhave one myself, but I know that their is not enough to go around, \nand also know that I probably will never be able to get one.  So I&#39;m \ncontent to have my Radio Shack Hack, without the ego problem.  \nThat&#39;s fine with me, I feel great about being a member of this \ngroup, and making some friends.  Maybe some day I might be able to \nuse what I learn from y&#39;all to build something for myself.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Later Guys, and have a great day\n&gt;    \n&gt;   William Rees    \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;            Hi All; We have been warned by others from time to time \nabout unbridled box use, as it supposedly brings in negativity. I \ndon&#39;t want to believe that, but there are a few cases of people \nusing boxes made by me, as well as the hack radios, and going whacko \nbig time. Its&#39; either all ego--I&#39;m the onlyest one that can use \nthis, or like the more recent example. I don&#39;t know if these people \nwere like this to start, or if it&#39;s an external influance, but it&#39;s \ndiscouraging. There seems to be a similar reaction with systems not \nmade by me--so I&#39;ve been told.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Soooo, maybe burn some white candles, and maybe get a Rosary. My \nguys talk about the Catholics, and the Purple Princess has a \nCatholic connection on the etheric levels, although the church \nimposes too many limits on her. I wouldn&#39;t want to go into a state \nof fear, but a little protection stuff couldn&#39;t hurt. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Not only do I not have the time to mass produce boxes, I&#39;m \nbeginning to think it&#39;s not a good idea anyway. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;   Express yourself wherever you are.
