Your points are well taken John.=C2=A0 And I agree it is a first attempt an=
d certainly can be improved on successive 
trials, and cannot determine the=
 origin of the messages.

For this first experiment/protocol, I thought we =
would go as generic as possible: it doesn't matter really here where the in=
formation comes from, or how different people interpret it: just determine =
the object in the specific timeframe.=C2=A0 We'll start with data on how ac=
curate the participants can get, however they do it.

As to your comment on=
 the audio files:=C2=A0 originally I considered requiring as part of the pr=
otocol to include the audio.=C2=A0 Maybe that is still a good idea.=C2=A0 T=
he reason I didn't, is because people often claim to hear different things =
each time they listen to a file.=C2=A0 Posting a file with an incorrect ans=
wer, for example, the person may later claim (after the experiment) to NOW =
hear the right answer.=C2=A0 And others may confirm it.

This seemed liked =
a rabbit hole, and I'm not sure how to handle it. So for this trial, I figu=
red we'd just not go there, and require replies only be valid if they are g=
iven during the experiments specified time frame. Once the actual object is=
 know, it seems too easy for a person to come up with the answer.

But yeah=
, we need to see how this goes, fix the problems, and come up with more of =
them!

Since we're talking about expe=
riments and protocols here are some ideas to improve
the protocol RJ sugges=
ted initially. Using a test target is one way of establishing a 
truth in t=
ime, which is the basis of this experiment. But there are a couple of issue=
s.
=C2=A0
It is quite possible that someone could discern the target throug=
h remote viewing alone.
This would negate the need for involvement of a spi=
rit communicator or discarnate entity.
Outcomes=C2=A0depend on the word of =
those reporting. The true skeptic (not cynic) would 
therefore say that thi=
s experiment contains a basic flaw in that it=C2=A0does not uniquely 
indic=
ate that the information was obtained in the prescribed manner. Providing a=
ccess
to the raw audio file would not necessarily constitute proof either, =
since many of these 
communications can only be heard by certain people, 
=
=C2=A0
If the audio file were quite clear, timing=C2=A0=C2=A0becomes an iss=
ue. In other words, when was 
the audio actually recorded?=C2=A0 This issue=
 can be mitigated simply by requiring any
claimant to email the audio file =
to a trusted party before the test ends. It would be best 
if the trusted p=
arty were not otherwise invovled in the experiment and it was=C2=A0 their d=
uty 
simply to=C2=A0collect the claims. Once all claims had been collected =
they could be posted 
publicly for review=C2=A0by the community in general.=
=C2=A0 The experimenter could decide if any 
of the claims seemed to have h=
it,=C2=A0and this decision could be reviewed by anyone if desired. 
=C2=A0
=
The important detail however is that this experiment does not completely an=
swer the 
question. It is a first attempt and certainly can be improved on =
successive trials.
=C2=A0
Successive trials are always a good idea, since i=
t provides replication. And it would be
best if others replicated the exper=
iment using a very similar protocol. If these were to
succeed, the communit=
y could then state that out of X trials Y had succeeded (by 
some definitio=
n of success) potentially=C2=A0giving a success rate above that expected 
b=
y random chance. This would make the outcome quantifiable and measureable 
=
and thus meaningful.
=C2=A0
But also important to note, this would only pro=
ve the potential veracity of the messages.
It would not (and cannot as far =
as I can tell) prove the origin of the messages. This detail
will, I fear, =
remain a matter for belief and speculation for quite some time to come.
