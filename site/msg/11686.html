&gt; &gt; Hey Guys,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any of you still use a 35mm to take pictures with? I have 2 of them
&gt; &gt; and tried over the weekend to utilize them in an investigation. The
&gt; &gt; exposure time on these things is like 30 seconds. It&#x27;s such a pain in
&gt; &gt; the butt. If you do use the 35mm, what kind of settings do you use?
&gt; &gt; Any advice? I am totally new to night photography. Has everyone gone
&gt; &gt; to digital now or what?

I use a digital SLR (Cannon Digital Rebel xti) with a big flash
mounted on it either directed up at the ceiling or with a diffuser
attached to avoid dust orbs. Occasionally I also will set it for a
long exposure to capture some cool architecture or something, but I
won&#x27;t use any of those photos as evidence just because there are so
many normal things that can happen during a long exposure to make
something odd show up in the pic. 
In most situations with the right lens (I love my Canon 50mm f1.8) you
can adjust the iso and f-stop to take a good picture in low light with
a fast shutter speed without needing the flash. If you don&#x27;t
understand how all the settings (f-stop, iso speed, shutter speed)
work together I&#x27;d suggest getting yourself a basic photography book or
taking a class at your local camera shop. You&#x27;d be amazed how many
&quot;ghost pictures&quot; will start just looking like camera operator error to
you after a while. haha
