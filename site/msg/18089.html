Said a little prayer, and tried to draw Ayn  Rand and her husband, Frank 
Rand into the light, I think it went well, as you  all might know, she did not 
believe in God.  And spent much of her life as  an atheist, I even hate 
that word.  Hopefully, some other's can here these  files, I tried to separate 
them best I could, but some of the sentences, go  together. I know, you all 
want them not to have the words I hear, but they are  long, and would not 
make sense if I take whole sentences a part.  The first  one where it says; 
Ayn Rand and Frank, lower plain people are saying; "they  aren't ready they 
with us" then someone says, "save us" then some one else, a  man who sounds 
spooky, says, "an ambush" then someone says, "David"  "here."  
 
In the second one; what sounds like  Angels, say, "let them pass,
In the third file, I put the whole thing, says,  "let them pass, their good"
The last file is a charm and i feel sorry for  anyone who can not hear that 
one because it's as clear as a bell, they, a man  says, "Hello," I say 
hello, then he says; "where are we?"  
 
The last one a lady, maybe an  angel, don't know of course, she says, "head 
first" I think she wants them  to bow as they walk into the light, it's 
very bright and hurts eyes or so I am  told, they are told to lower the gaze, 
or close eyes, when they are inside,  it softens, and they are home.  Hope 
you all can hear, as for you RJ,  I am still trying to get David to tell me, 
it's not his fault, but my  own, it is hard to understand him sometimes. So, 
far I've got from the  peanut gallery, that you have: "a penny," "a hair 
broom or brush," "whistle," a  little kid says, "ice cream" lol, "bridge" and a 
"Kleenex"  I have no  idea what the heck you would have a "bridge" on the 
top for, unless  it's the game.  sf
