Is there anyway we can move this group over to a better suited environment for categorizing?  I tend to think of being able to categorize these different emails in a place being much more managable in a bulletin board style forum.

I simply hit the delete \nbutton and the post goes unread.\n\nI know we all everyone, put a lot of time and work into our research \nand when it falls through the cracks without even being presented for \ncomment, it gets disheartening.\n\nMaybe we should start a group for social and casual discussion \namongst members and have this one for hard research posts.\nThat way one does not conflict with the other.\n\nI know I sound like sour grapes, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one to \nfeel this way.\n\nAnd I know the comments will come that no one has time to read all \nthe posts or respond to all the files.
