<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Mike,
My viewpoint on this is that 1485kHz was a frequency that provided 
Jurgenson with one (of probably many) correct combinations of 
frequency spectra and dynamics necessary for the formation of EVP - 
at that period in time, and at that location.
In chapter 24 of &quot;Sprechfunk mit Verstorbenen&quot;, Jurgenson mentions 
that &quot;Lena&quot; used a special sound frequency that she fashioned from 
the overlapping of certain sounds and which would have sounded in 
most cases like a toneless, meaningless hissing.
Also he mentions that the &quot;friends&quot; were able to shape the sound 
frequencies of the radio waves by instantly modulating the existing 
sounds.
But most importantly, in chapter 43 he mentions being able to turn 
the radio dial carefully and hear Lena&#x27;s voice on almost every 
frequency.

I tend to conclude therefore that 1485khz was one of many useful 
frequencies he used that time, but probably holds no specific 
relevance today, excepting if it is able to provide the correct 
spectral dynamics (more than any other frequency).
regards,
JEFF
