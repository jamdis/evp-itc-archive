TO THE MEMBERS OF GRASSHARP: 
  MAKE SURE YOU POST THIS BACK IN YOUR GROUP THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU! YOU DONT EVN FOLLOW YOUR OWN RULES OF YOUR GROUP! Quite funny isnt it? The owners even dont abide by thier own rules if yall are slamming our group and its members and they are ALLOWING IT! What a great group to belong to! How open minded, especially for people SUPPOSEDLY into paranormal!
   
  This list discusses "Electronic Voice Phenomena" or EVP/ITC (Instrumental Trans Communication). EVP recordings are the capturing of "spirit" voices and sounds on audio tape or digitally. Anyone can do this.   We also discuss various methods of EVP recording, ITC, and share our results.   We have different types of members, some are not scientific. Others are of a more educated, scientific background. We'd like everyone to feel welcome here, but don't want to get too tied up in any particular dogma, or belief system, whether it's spiritual, or scientific. We try to remain as informal as possible.   With that in mind, we do not appreciate posts that are religious, evangelical, or fundementalist in nature as this is a diverse list. Please refrain from such posts as they and the offender will be denied and removed. We really dislike to have to take such actions, so please respect our members and list topic. If you feel you are a Prophet, have a direct contact to religious
 deities, or feel the need to dictate religious beliefs, perhaps you don't belong on this list. Those who are inconsiderate, who attack, or are rude will be removed.   Posts attempting to debunk evp or it's research are also not appreciated. This is not a forum to discuss if evp is real, factual, or exists. We believe it is, and does, and continue to research evp rationally, scientifically and with a big sense of humor.   We have found that not all EVP recorded claims to be only departed human souls. We've heard from Nature energies/intelligences, those who have never been incarnated on the earth plane, and even some who claim to be Extra Terretrials. EVP is not to be limited to simply what is termed "ghosts" or "hauntings", but can be recorded anywhere at anytime. Please keep an open mind.   There is no soliciting ever. You must have a full profile filled out to join.
