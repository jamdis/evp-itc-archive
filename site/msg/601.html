Misty - We recently demonstrated ITC recording techniques for members of our local research group. I set up the feedback method then the white video noise recording method. I somehow feel the feedback method will yield the results I am hoping for but haven't reviewed enough work of our collegues in the field to compare success ratios for each method. I recorded three minutes of each setup and we did a quick review but didn't have time during that meeting to transfer the recorded material into a computer for proper frame by frame analysis.
   
  Which recording method do you believe is the most effective?
