So, skip would be you, Margaret, \npicking up a another city&#39;s radio broadcast from let&#39;s say 400 miles \naway, for example. \n\nHowever, the theory of &quot;skip&quot; does not answer the specific messages we \nreceive that line-up with questions, the experimenter, place, etc.  \nAgain relevancy is so important to me in deciding if a message is radio \nfrag, skip or communication.  I might note that radio skip fluctuates \ndpeneding on atmospheric conditions, I think, so how do we receive \nmessages when skip is not prominent?  \n\nThose are some of my thoughts...hope it helps.  :)\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have let my boyfriend listen to some of my files.
