I&#39;m warning this might sound far-fetched but I&#39;d really like to know what others think... has anyone come across the idea that it is possible to cross over spirits into an actual light, like a candle light for example?  or is the light just a light in the other plane.... can it be a tangible light????  a couple things made me wonder about this.... and I&#39;m thinking, if spirits can manifest across our tangible/physical sound waves, could they use our light waves to cross???  Thoughts?"}
