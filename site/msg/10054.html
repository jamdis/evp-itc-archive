<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, winamp works, but be sure and not set it it to convert all your 
files over to winamp files.  When I downloaded it a long time ago, I 
accidentally forgot to unmark that preference during the set-up and 
it converted every audio file on my computer to a winamp file.  

Not cool when you want to make them available for all to hear.  :)

&gt; Try downloading WinAmp some reason it made mine open up.  I had the 
same problem.

for

today 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; communicate through. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#x27;s almost as if the ability to talk to the other side has 
been 
&gt; &gt; &gt; there the whole time, or better yet, that the other side has 
&gt; been 
&gt; &gt; &gt; communicating with us the whole time, but we simply needed to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; become &quot;awakened&quot; to it...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When I first listened to the Spiricom samples several years 
&gt; ago, 
&gt; &gt; my 
&gt; &gt; &gt; immediate impression was: Hmm, it sounds like someone using 
&gt; &gt; &gt; an &quot;electronic larynx&quot; (speech aid device). This impression was 
&gt; &gt; &gt; strengthened by the observation that the buzzing sound often 
was 
&gt; &gt; even 
&gt; &gt; &gt; modulated by O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s own voice during the dialoges between 
him 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and &quot;Dr. Mueller&quot;! (Did O&#x27;Neill forget to remove the device 
from 
&gt; &gt; his 
&gt; &gt; &gt; throat while talking to his counterpart?)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And what about the &quot;13 frequencies&quot; that are supposed to be 
&gt; used 
&gt; &gt; as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;carrier&quot; for the spirit voices? Why aren&#x27;t they audible in 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; recordings? And why does a mixture of the 13 tones created with 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Audition sound so different from the typical &quot;Spiricom buzz&quot;? - 
&gt; &gt; Well, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; if you analyze the frequency spectrum of the buzzing sound 
(this 
&gt; &gt; can 
&gt; &gt; &gt; be done with Audition etc.), you will find a lot of harmonics 
&gt; &gt; (peaks 
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the spectrum), and some of these harmonics more or less 
match 
&gt; &gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 13 Spiricom frequencies...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To me, the entire Spiricom saga produces more questions than 
&gt; &gt; &gt; answers...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks Guy, I have heard a few people mention that O&#x27;Neil 
&gt; &gt; hoaxed 
&gt; &gt; &gt; it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I don&#x27;t know enough about this to really pass any sort 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; judgement. Looking forward to seeing your website.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In regards to the Spiricom story - I have to assume 
you&#x27;re 
&gt; &gt; &gt; referring to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Mark IV model as diagrammed/written up in the 
Spiricom 
&gt; &gt; &gt; manual (as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opposed to the INCORRECT diagram made by Polish 
researcher 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Wojciech 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Drewniak...http://www.worlditc.org/k_06_spiricom.htm ).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While my research is still not finished (and I&#x27;ve been 
&gt; &gt; working 
&gt; &gt; &gt; on this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a little over 2 years), I&#x27;m leaning toward the Mark 
IV 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conversations as having been hoaxed by Bill O&#x27;Neil. 
&gt; HOWEVER - 
&gt; &gt; I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he acted alone and that none of the other members of the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Metascience 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Foundation were involved with this hoax. As to O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; &gt; motivation for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the hoax - I still don&#x27;t know. But I will also say that 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; veridical 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence that O&#x27;Neil claims to have received about Dr. 
&gt; George 
&gt; &gt; &gt; J. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mueller through clairaudience is amazing and it is tough 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; see 
&gt; &gt; &gt; how 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; O&#x27;Neil would have gotten this information given his 
&gt; finances, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; location, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the timeframe, etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been promising to get my personal website up and 
&gt; &gt; operating 
&gt; &gt; &gt; for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some time now but have been busy. Hopefully soon. Then 
&gt; I&#x27;ll 
&gt; &gt; &gt; start 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; posting what I have found out so far.
