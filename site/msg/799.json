I agree with what you are saying.  That \nmakes sense.

Putting these \ninto \n&gt; production might be a good thing. Not to mention the people that \nwould \n&gt; colaborate to help out with any design flaws.\n&gt; &gt; just a thought. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;          \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Amy Sutter \n&gt; \n&gt; www.myspace.com/LON3_S7AR\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Check me out!\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Food fight?
