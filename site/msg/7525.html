&gt;           WOW...so many questions, lol!
&gt;
&gt;           Let me address the communication with the women and the  
&gt; Boxes!  I currently own a Frank&#x27;s Box, #12, which was actually  
&gt; willed to me via Bruce.  I had no problem with communication from  
&gt; the get go, and actually have been present many times before and  
&gt; worked with audio clips for several years prior to receiving a  
&gt; Frank&#x27;s Box.  There are many differences with the make up of each  
&gt; and every box, with the exceptions of the RS.  At no time have I  
&gt; ever had problems getting good communication given I had good  
&gt; reception.  We all struggle at times having good or bad sessions,  
&gt; but that is the nature of the beast.
&gt;
&gt;            The other women to own a Frank&#x27;s Box is Rosemary Ellen  
&gt; Guiley.  She has 2 Frank&#x27;s Boxes. Ursula Bielski also owns a Joe&#x27;s  
&gt; Box.   I don&#x27;t believe this was intentional on Frank&#x27;s part, it  
&gt; just happened this way.  After Chris Moon obtainning the boxes and  
&gt; the falling out between Frank and Chris, he has just decided that  
&gt; it is better at this time not to give anyone any.  The Mini Box as  
&gt; well as the RS serve the same purpose and you can get just as good  
&gt; of communication from them.
&gt;
&gt;               It is my theory that the color purple as to do with  
&gt; the energy level, Tesla also believed this.  This is only my theory  
&gt; and doubt we will ever be able to pin point the reference in my  
&gt; life time.  I have a theory as well about vibrations and I can clue  
&gt; you in later on that in obtaining EVP.
&gt;
&gt;                As far as building a box, there is a great book out  
&gt; there called Electronic Pojects from the Next Dimension by Newton  
&gt; C. Braga.  There are schmatics in there for different projects, as  
&gt; well as box schmatics on all of the boards.  It&#x27;s just like  
&gt; anything else at the idea that you will have to make changes as you  
&gt; go along to see what works for you.
&gt;
&gt;                 The audio software is the same, which ever you  
&gt; think works for you.  There are so many out there.  I use Adobe  
&gt; Audition, Bruce and Steve use Cool Edit, Ann uses something for her  
&gt; Mac. (ect.).  There are free downloads on most of our  
&gt; siteswww.ispiinvestigations.com.  Try them out, and see which one  
&gt; you like the best.  There are so many of us at this point that at  
&gt; least one of us are bound to have the experience in using it, LOL.
&gt;
&gt;                    I hope this helps, looking forward to hearing  
&gt; your clips!

&gt; Hello all !!
&gt; I have been lurking on the board for awhile, feeling not much to
&gt; contribute.
&gt; I am interested in this connection and communication (Thanks to
&gt; Debbie !!)
&gt; I&#x27;ve observed a few things on the board. Somehow this word &quot;purple&quot;
&gt; keeps popping up and I can&#x27;t help but to think of the color purple in
&gt; the spectrum. Does the color relate to some sort of sound wave
&gt; also ? or correlates to something in the electronic field that your
&gt; helpers from the other side are trying to propose ?
&gt;
&gt; Also, I have noticed that the Frank boxes do not seem to be
&gt; distributed to many women (is this because women do not have good
&gt; results with the other side ?)
&gt; I know Debbie has done a lot of successful work, but, does this mean
&gt; that women have a more difficult time with communication ?
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t have a box and I don&#x27;t know how to build one !! I went to
&gt; radio shack and whatever was recommended is replaced with the new 470.
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t know where to begin except that Frank recommended starting
&gt; with EVPMAKER. I&#x27;d like to build something of my own and don&#x27;t know
&gt; where to start with a receiver/scanner of my own.
&gt; I&#x27;d be so happy if someone could share some technology with me !!!??
&gt; thanks, Holly
