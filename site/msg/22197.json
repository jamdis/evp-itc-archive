I believe in giving credit where credit is due, but I&#39;d be a fool\nto believe that no one else had anything good to contribute. People are\ngoing to try their own experiments with the boxes. They may or may not find\nsome surprising things. That remains to be seen. But I would never squelch\nothers&#39; research.\n\nI don&#39;t think everyone wants to use them for paranormal investigation\n(ghost hunting) &quot;in the dark&quot; and not all paranormal investigators are\ndoing it to be scared. I don&#39;t scare easily and fear is the last thing on\nmy mind in an investigation. Also, I do not believe everyone is out to\nsteal your claim to fame as the early researcher of the box. But realize\nthere may be a few who have something useful to contribute and we may yet\nlearn something from their work.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Wed, Nov 16, 2011 at 11:04 AM, Tracy &lt;klipprchic@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As others have said, i never post over here but do read it. I am disgusted\n&gt; at the recent posts lately.. and not just because Steve is my brother..\n&gt;\n&gt; The rants, name calling, and vulgarity that comes from you Frank is\n&gt; appalling. It seems to me that anyone that tries to do anything as far as\n&gt; making a box is shot down and no one knows what they are doing other than\n&gt; you.. I can&#39;t imagine why anyone would bother with you at all.. You seem to\n&gt; be the angriest person i have ever seen.. Not to mention, having one sided\n&gt; arguments.. I have been watching for days since you have thrown steve off\n&gt; the group and your rants toward him calling him every name in the book go\n&gt; unanswered..\n&gt;\n&gt; Feel free to throw me off as well.. I won&#39;t post here again.. Whatever is\n&gt; written on this board that you created shows no promise in anything\n&gt; paranormal.. Negativity will never get you anywhere.. Paranormal unity is\n&gt; about working together, not tearing everyone apart.. I have no respect for\n&gt; you, as inventor of the box or not.. Doesn&#39;t matter.. You have to give\n&gt; respect to get it..\n&gt;\n&gt; Tracy\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI hink jus abou e e y esea che can expec o he s o con inue he esea ch.
