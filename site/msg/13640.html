    Good questions Earl.  I think the answer depends on your plan for the f=
ile.  If it just for yourself, then I guess any name will do, that helps to=
 best organize your data, and helps you in your overall research or goals. =
 

        And when sending it to others, it also depends on your goals.  I=
f you're in phase of wanting to get confirmation of what you believe you ha=
ve captured, or general input on your technique, then maybe labeling it by =
the content works for that.  If you are in a phase where you want to improv=
e your technique, and want verify, as objectively as possible, what you hav=
e recorded, then naming it by perhaps the date and time and some sequence I=
D number would be better, so as to remove as much potential as possible tha=
t the name would influence the listener?

          reading Rick's and Frank"s comments =
here i started to wonder.
          what is the best way to post EVP's ??
 =
         i know to crop out the segment that has the EVP you want others to=
 hear 
          and see if they can make it out.
          So do we label =
the file what they are saying or just mark it with a 
          number and =
keep track in a log file what that Number file says.??
          I do like =
the idea of not labeling the file what it is saying to see if 
          th=
ey come up with what i think i hear.
          But then again some times I'=
m tired and knowing what the file says when 
          I'm listening to it =
from some one else does help.
          Earl..
