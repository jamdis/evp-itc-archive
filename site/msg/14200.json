I made good on my escape, LOL.  If everyone will bear with me I think I recall the files, involved.  This happened just a little over a year ago, and I think I still have the files.  When I find them I will let you know the file types and the destination and origin of the files.  I had a computer crash since that time and I will have to back to backup files to extract and restore the files. I think that I got a copy of the file that our member had that was a total loss as a copy, with the data loss.  The data loss was great enough that the file did not come close to the original.  I got in my car and drove over to my team members home to listen to the file I ad sent him by e-mail through Yahoo I believe. I &#39;ll verify that too.\n\nI will try to get you guys the information on the files by tomorrow night.  I hope everyone had a great weekend.\n\n \nRegards,\nJon in Texas\n \n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: April Abercrombie &lt;april@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Sunday, May 10, 2009 3:50:03 PM\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules-ATTENTION JON\n\n\n\n\n\nI have not personally experienced the loss \nmyself.

For example, if I had a  program in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it could  compress it.  But if it lost even one bit, the resulting  exe file would not execute again after it was uncompressed on  the other side.\n\nThis kind of compression does things  like looking for common patterns in the file, and replacing  them with a token.  A rough example would be if it found  &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot; in a file 20 times, it could replace all the  occurances with say $HN1.  And also write a little  dictionary in there someplace that says &quot;$HN1=Howdy  Neighbor&quot;.\n\nWhen the file gets to its destination it can  be uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are replaced with  &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot;.  So it was compressed (instead of 14  characters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionary), but  lost no data.\n\nSome formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not  lossless.  Depending on the level of compression, some  level of data is lost, and so cannot be recovered or  reconstructed later.\n\nRick\n\n\n\n--- On Sun,  5/10/09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh  ostresearch. com&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom:  April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch.  com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading  rules\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\nDate: Sunday, May  10, 2009, 10:26 AM\n\n\nAnother  thing:\n \nI recently found this  out. When you email a file, if it is not saved as a  compressed format, the email filtering process will actually  compress the file automatically.\n \nSo even if you have  attached a wav. file, it will loose resolution over the  email process. It will not sound exactly the same as the  original wav. file. How much it differs depends on the size  of the file you are attaching. If it is a very large  file, it will sound much different.\n \nThe only exception to  this is if the wav. file is small enough that the filtering  process will ignore it. It has to be pretty small though,  like under 1 MB (I am not exactly sure of the  threshold).\n \nThe best way to share  files over the internet if you want them as close to  the original as possible is to upload them directly to a  website.\n \n-----  Original Message ----- \nFrom: Rj \nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com \nSent: Sunday, May 10, 2009 10:54 AM\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n\n\nPixelization doesn&#39;t clean-up the  data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a picture  of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels  or pixelization to the picture.  Soon, you  would not be able to tell there were flowers there  at all.  You would see a lot of colored  blocks.\n\nOr in the other direction, imagine  you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of  pixes on your screen: a complete screen of truely  random static snow.  Pixelizing this, after a  while, you would again start to see colored  blocks.\n\nWhat&#39;s happening is that it is  processing an area of the image, taking (for  instance) the average value of that entire area, and  replacing all the blocks in that area with the  average.  In video processing, this would  result in a field of multi-colored flowers being  replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish  block, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the  noise example, it maybe replace all the random  pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.   If you did not know beforehand what the original  picture was, you couldn&#39;t tell whether your  pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a  chevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of  pixels.\n\nIt works the same with the sound  files.  Taking something as complex as speech,  and replacing frequencies with their averages, loses  the speech the farther you go, until you head  strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the  same to random static will eventually produce the  same thing.  And random fluctuating square  waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, you  could have fun sharing with each other what you  thing they &#39;sound like&#39;.\n\n\n\n\n\n---  On Sun, 5/10/09, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom:  Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@  yahoo.com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File  uploading rules\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups  .com\nDate: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 9:29 \nAM\n\n\nI always save the whole file in wav format  then do my clips as mp3.

I seem to remember some experiments done  with blank tapes/film, no recording done  yet there were voices/images there. I find it  all interesting.\n \nJust a thought.

While some formats  (like wav) can store the audio very close to the  way it was recorded, formats like mp3 compress  the file, and in so doing lose some of the sonic  details.  This may not be a big deal in  music, where the audio is fairly clear to begin  with.  But with sound sources with a lot of  noise (like evps), this can not only obscure any  real sounds, but pixelize non-sounds (like white  noise) and make them start to sound like  speech.\n\nSo mp3 might be good for sharing  the data, once you&#39;ve already formed an opinion  based on an analysis of the wav file.  But  mp3 is not good as a medium for analysis.   It can lead to many false positives and  misinterpretations.\n\n--- On Sun,  5/10/09, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@  yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom:  Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@  yahoo.com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File  uploading rules\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups  .com\nDate: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 8:26  AM\n\n\nThanks =)\n \n You will get the hang of it.

When you email a file, if it is not saved as a \n                    compressed format, the email filtering process will actually \n                    compress the file automatically.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n                    &lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n                    &lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;So even if you have \n                    attached a wav. file, it will loose resolution over the \n                    email process. It will not sound exactly the same as the \n                    original wav. file. How much it differs depends on the size \n                    of the file you are attaching. If it is a very&nbsp;large \n                    file, it will sound much different.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n                    &lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n                    &lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;The only exception to \n                    this is if the wav. file is small enough that the filtering \n                    process will ignore it. It has to be pretty small though, \n                    like under 1&nbsp;MB (I am not exactly sure of the \n                    threshold).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n                    &lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;

Imagine taking a picture \n                            of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels \n                            or pixelization to the picture.&nbsp; Soon, you \n                            would not be able to tell there were flowers there \n                            at all.&nbsp; You would see a lot of colored \n                            blocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or in the other direction, imagine \n                            you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of \n                            pixes on your screen: a complete screen of truely \n                            random static snow.&nbsp; Pixelizing this, after a \n                            while, you would again start to see colored \n                            blocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What&#39;s happening is that it is \n                            processing an area of the image, taking (for \n                            instance) the average value of that entire area, and \n                            replacing all the blocks in that area with the \n                            average.&nbsp; In video processing, this would \n                            result in a field of multi-colored flowers being \n                            replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish \n                            block, with no resemblance to flowers.&nbsp; In the \n                            noise example, it maybe replace all the random \n                            pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.&nbsp; \n                            If you did not know beforehand what the original \n                            picture was, you couldn&#39;t tell whether your \n                            pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a \n                            chevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of \n                            pixels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It works the same with the sound \n                            files.&nbsp; Taking something as complex as speech, \n                            and replacing frequencies with their averages, loses \n                            the speech the farther you go, until you head \n                            strange fluctuating square waves.&nbsp; Doing the \n                            same to random static will eventually produce the \n                            same thing.&nbsp; And random fluctuating square \n                            waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, you \n                            could have fun sharing with each other what you \n                            thing they &#39;sound like&#39;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- \n                            On &lt;b&gt;Sun, 5/10/09, Misty Dawn &lt;i&gt;&lt;bulletbabea@ \n                            &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot;
