A white cloud to me sounds like &quot;light&quot; and just \nmay be a good spirit/entity or whoever, in the home. How do we know \nthat this was a negative spirit/ghost trying to bring others through \nan electronic device and into a home for mischief???  ;)\n\nI personally do not subscribe to the whole portal thing.  If so, then \nmy house would be filled with ghosts after all my watching of \ninnumerable paranormal TV shows!  I think my TV would make a much \nbetter portal than my radios...  :)\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; for all researchers,\n&gt; \n&gt; THIS IS NOT FOR THE REASON OF PUSHING A PANIC BUTTON OR A MATTER OF \n&gt; GIVING IN TO FEAR. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is simply an incident that I feel researchers should be aware of \n&gt; as a possibility. Given in my opinion the boxes do open a portal \ndue \n&gt; to the connection necessary for real time two way communication, \nand \n&gt; the wide spread belief that entities can and do manipulate physical \n&gt; objects when in the presence of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have just been made aware of a situation that has happened to a \n&gt; fairly new researcher whom I believe to be honest and forthcoming.\n&gt; \n&gt; the incident involved the aftermath of a regular RS box session. \nThe \n&gt; researcher had finished his session with the practice of asking \nthat \n&gt; any entities that may have traveled through the box, return and \nasked \n&gt; for conformation, then proceeded to end the session and turn the \nbox \n&gt; off. he was assured that he turned the box off by going back to the \n&gt; recording after the incident and validating verbally that he did in \n&gt; fact turn off the box.\n&gt; \n&gt; He left the room for a few moments , when he returned he allegedly  \n&gt; witnessed a white cloud move across the room and noticed that his \nRS \n&gt; box was turned on and running.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is actually the first instance I have encountered where the \n&gt; possibility of an entity that may have\n&gt; \n&gt; purposely stayed behind to turn the box back on and let other \n&gt; entities through. matter of fact\n&gt; \n&gt; that concept has not occurred to me before. but now sounds very \n&gt; possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; This may even happen at times we are never aware of and they \nactually \n&gt; turn the box on and when \n&gt; whatever comes through is through they turn it off again and we are \n&gt; none the wiser.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will definitely address this in my sessions, what I suggest is \n&gt; until we come to a mutual agreement among researchers\n&gt; on this occurrence, I think it best that when we end a session we \n&gt; remove at least one battery from the box to prevent it being turned\n&gt; back on.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;"}
