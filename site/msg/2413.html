 It's not a question of whether or not the break can be set, the question =
is "How much money do you have?" At this moment--I hate this place, and hum=
anity sucks!

A trip to the vet will answer that question, usually most =
breaks can be set unless there is another underlying problem. It is a cute =
lil dog, sometimes they are very fragile bone structures because of breedin=
g. There are a few small dogs that seem to have alot of problems with bad b=
acks and breaking legs/feet. 
 
I think its proof to those who want it, and=
 as for me...nobody is talking about me on the radio, or using my full name=
...so it definitely gets my attention when my name is being used in context=
 with things that are going on around me or happening to people I know.
 
I=
 dont need any proof, they just give it freely so I can share or in some ca=
ses not share with everyone.
 
I stopped lookin for proof right about the t=
ime this all started. My first evp was all that I needed to get me on this =
path. My mothers voice, so long after shes been passed, friends, relatives,=
 or even perfect strangers who I had no clue about until I found out after =
the fact....way too many proofs have been freely given to me, and I never a=
sked for one. Earl and Bob Cox, I think thats one of my favorite WOW moment=
s, not knowing about Erland Babcock it was an easy misunderstanding. Luckil=
y I make everything phonetic so it was easy to catch later. I have listened=
 to others evp from him since then and I often STILL hear earl and bob cox.=
 They have also given me names of workers on this side who I have bumped in=
to later tho I usually put off contacting anyone they mention until I think=
 the time is right. Usually it is just weird to find out its a REAL LIVE pe=
rson and that they just happen to be in the EVP/ITC field. 
 
I used to alw=
ays assume when they say a name they are talking about spirits there. Or th=
at if I get an ITC image its a spirit face. They proved thats a wrong assum=
ption on several occasions. Probably the only time I ever asked for anythin=
g was while doing an itc session, after so many faces I just wanted them to=
 show me something else, anything else, "show me something different" led t=
o a few portraits of the living.
 
Sometimes they speak the truth, sometime=
s a wayward thought creeps threw that shouldnt (or just a creep)... as for =
the dog...take it to the vet and see what they can do then you will know mo=
