Interesting stuff!\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Misty,\n&gt; \n&gt; yes, but as mentioned in the article, the soundwaves engraved in \nsmoke\n&gt; on paper were never intended to be played at that time. So it was\n&gt; actually in best a preliminary stage to the phonograph. In most \ncases,\n&gt; inventions don&#39;t fall from the sky, and of course it seems very \nlikely\n&gt; that Edison had already heard of the &quot;phonautograph&quot; before he \ndeveloped\n&gt; his phonograph.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yeah it makes one wonder. Then again this country not to mention \nthe \n&gt; &gt; world as a whole has always been on the brink of new technology \nwhich \n&gt; &gt; they either cover up or covet to the point others rarely know of \nits \n&gt; &gt; existence. I wonder what else is laying around that was invented \nthat \n&gt; &gt; nobody knows about or told others about. I found the smoke thing \n&gt; &gt; interesting tho. Never would have thought of that one so I was \namazed \n&gt; &gt; that someone else did so long before edisons work became the \n&gt; &gt; forefront of technology. Considering the time frame it makes me \n&gt; &gt; ponder if he had heard of the work or just the idea even was \nenough \n&gt; &gt; to set his wheels turning and get him thinking in that direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Misty,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; yeah, fascinating; however, I wonder why mechanical audio \nrecording \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reproduction techniques haven&#39;t been invented much earlier, \nsince \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; technical principle behind that is actually quite \nstraightforward. I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; could easily imagine that someone like Leonardo da Vinci could \nhave\n&gt; &gt;&gt; invented such a machine...\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Stefan\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; -- \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I ran across this tonight while surfing the web and found it \n&gt; &gt; interesting.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7318180.stm\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   Misty\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
