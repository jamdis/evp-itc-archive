It sounds like she's saying "one, two, ....."
=A0
A mistake that a lot of p=
eople make is thinking that there are two different types of energy at work=
 when it comes to sound waves and electromagnetic waves. The only thing tha=
t seperates them is frequency and power. Radio waves are radio waves becaus=
e they occupy a certain block of the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves=
 exist on that same spectrum just farther down with much longer waves. Soun=
dwaves and subsonic waves can penetrate almost anything because of their wa=
velengths. The shorter the wavelength the more ways we can shield against t=
hem.
=A0
Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and telemetry =
transmitting wave but the waves also have a physical effect on our environm=
ent by causing molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A little lower th=
an this is IR or infrared it too can cause physical objects to heat up but =
usually it just causes molecules to rotate in place. All physical things gi=
ve off IR light. Its a way the total system conserves energy by spontaneous=
ly emitting IR radiation.

Here is some f=
ood for thought. I am currently reviewing my audio from our May 30th invest=
igation.
=A0
It was me and another girl teammate=A0present in the room. I p=
icked up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry with =
me. We were standing right next to another digital video recorder that I le=
ave beside my night vision camera. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd v=
oice. I have asked the girl that was with me to check her recording to see =
if she picked it up.
=A0
I have long felt the true EVP does not come from s=
ound waves in the environment, or then it wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodie=
d voice. Somehow EVP's are appearing directly on the recordings.
=A0
This i=
nstance with the recorders may back that theory up. That other recorder sho=
uld have picked that voice up if it were sound waves in the environment.
=
=A0
I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The=A0file that is named=A0"=
01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip.=A0You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", =
and then another comes in right after that. I think I know what it says.
=
=A0
Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear this unti=
l playback. It isn't clear, so I am not as excited about it as my one's fro=
m the last investigation.

I have a running theory that EVP i=
s carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it =
to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrason=
ic waves that differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtract t=
hem together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, =
if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a r=
oom creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermed=
iate difference=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz =
to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates=
 ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt=
 that EVP were generated within a few inches of the recorder.
=A0
We are ab=
le to reproduce this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems =
but also with acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a commercia=
l produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
