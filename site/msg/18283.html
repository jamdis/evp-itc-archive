<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Also, if you listen to that podcast you will hear some very specific protocols that these science minded folks display.  Like giggling like school girls while attacking a person that neither of them know.  And, my favorite in the show:

Dr Rorke calling me a douce bag at around 20 minutes in.  This is who is representing the field of scientific research.

&gt;  That&#x27;s the rub, a cure for cancer would put many thousands out of
&gt; work--there will be no cure, too much $$$ in research and toxic treatments
&gt; that kill more than the desease. Science in this county is a joke! You can
&gt; fund a study to verify whatever results you are willing to pay for.

&gt; &gt; Been thinking and decided that we are not wrong in our beliefs.  If we can
&gt; &gt; help find a missing child as so many do with $30 shack hacks, than where is
&gt; &gt; the harm and the threat.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Science spends billions of dollars each and every year to find a cure for
&gt; &gt; cancer with no results.  I&#x27;m talking about a $30 radio that may help and
&gt; &gt; has.  Seems like we have the upper hand in the matter.  Just because our
&gt; &gt; methods are not accepted as the norm, does that mean that it serves no
&gt; &gt; purpose.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If society spent billions of dollars on ghost box research every year, we
&gt; &gt; wouldn&#x27;t even be having a conversation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; p.s.---- Modern science has found a cure for cancer, they just can&#x27;t reveal
&gt; &gt; it because they are making a fortune off of treatments.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; p.s.s.----Thanx RJ for posting that link for that show.....Why are you here
&gt; &gt; anyway?
