I think we also need to keep in mind that certain methods and technological devices will work for some and not for others, especially if there is a &quot;debunker mentality&quot; going on, but even if there is not.  For example, the Spiricom device has not worked very well for any others who have tried it since its inception; according to Mark Macy, all they have managed to get are very simple EVP, which we all have gotten from our digital or analog voice recorders.  The Scole Experiment people have said that debunkers inhibit the interaction, so why have them around or bother with them?\n   \n  There is also the &quot;medium&quot; theory, which many researchers claim is necessary to successful communication.  I don&#39;t consider myself a medium in the current sense of the term, but I guess I am in that I receive some pretty good EVP at times, while others try and try and receive nothing. \n   \n  I don&#39;t get discouraged if I try a method that has worked well for others, in the past or currently, and it doesn&#39;t work for me.  After all, it&#39;s all about our etheric communicators and how they can communicate with us as individuals.  Let the debunkers have their say and we can continue on with our research, right?
