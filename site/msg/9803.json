Her husband Captain Babcock was lightkeeper from 1871-1881; then again in 1900-1919. His son also was an assistant keeper from 1901-1919; then keeper from 1919-1925. First question, &quot;Is there a Captain Babcock here?&quot; Then a weird-sounding reply which sounds like &quot;Babcock&quot; (sort of). Then another question is asked, &quot;Is there any ghosts around here?&quot; and the reply, &quot;Spirit of Babcock.&quot; \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/LC%27s%20FM%20Spirit%20Box%20Prototype/captain_babcock_SPIRIT_OF_BABCOCK.wav \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n\nRegards,\n\nlcdupla &lt;lcdupla@...&gt;"}
