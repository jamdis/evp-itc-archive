<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Everyone,

My name is James from Arizona and have about a million questions about 
EVP. I am a ghosthunter and I have had great success in recording 
EVP&#x27;s recently. I have included a link to one of our recent 
investigations and recorded an EVP at a restaurant that said &quot;Say 
Goodbye!&quot; as an investigator and myself were walking away from the 
area.This is an authentic EVP.

It came from a cassette tape and has not been altered or filtered in 
the least. I have been an active ghosthunter for about 3 years now. 
Here is the link. Would like to know what you all think of it.

Question: I am noticing a strange echo reverberation when I record 
loud EVP&#x27;s. When I record &quot;whisper&quot; type EVP&#x27;s I don&#x27;t get this echo.

What do you all think casuses this strange echo quality?

Look forward to talking to all of you!

James</pre>
