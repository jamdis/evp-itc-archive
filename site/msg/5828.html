<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi new members Carol and Ralph! I&#x27;m pretty new myself, just today did  
my first 470 RS Hack (assisted by my 12 year old) and anxious to get  
started. Mike, your video was as clear as day, had no problems with  
the hack and took me about 5 minutes. Thanks!

Hopefully soon I&#x27;ll be posting my own EVPs, and I promise I won&#x27;t  
complain if I don&#x27;t get any feedback. I can&#x27;t keep up with this group  
as it is.

Carol and Ralph, hang on for a wild ride, this forum is very busy and  
you&#x27;ll have your hands full trying to keep up.

Ralph, I&#x27;ve seen your SPIRIT group somewhere in my travels. I&#x27;m headed  
out for an investigation at Eastern State in July, wanted to visit  
Gettysburg during that trip as well. Any tips/advice would be  
appreciated!

&gt;
&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; My name is Carol and I&#x27;ve been an investigator for 10+ years. I&#x27;m  
&gt; new to
&gt; the Frank&#x27;s box device, and am totally fascinated by it! My husband  
&gt; works
&gt; in recording studios and is willing to build me my first box. I would
&gt; like to work with the RS hack too. I&#x27;ve got many great class a evp&#x27;s  
&gt; from
&gt; my dvr...but I&#x27;m really looking forwards to working with Frank&#x27;s Box.
&gt; Glad to meet y&#x27;all.
&gt;
&gt; Carol B.
