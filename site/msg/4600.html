<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce,

With the thousands of Elvis impersonators out there, many of them who 
have crossed over, do you think maybe one of them came through for 
you?
I knew a person who was hand picked by Elvis to work for him at 
Graceland in the early days at Graceland.  Maybe the next time &quot;he&quot; 
comes through you can inquire as to the name of this person I know, 
that he knows.
This person was &quot;very special&quot; to him and she was hand picked by 
Elvis based on her looks (she told me that), even though the duties 
she provided at Graceland were none such that good looks were 
required.

I&#x27;m hoping if it is Elvis, he will know who you are inquiring about. 
Only he would know this, not an Elvis impersonator.

Tell him her father&#x27;s last name begins with the letter &quot;R&quot; and he 
traveled with &quot;MP&quot;.  He only needs to give you her first name.

With this information I have provided, there is no doubt that &quot;he&quot; 
will know who you are asking about.

- Mike

&gt; Sorry for the misunderstanding
&gt; I agree with you on the point of validation completely.

&gt; No additional vaildation from you is needed, I was stating that 
recognizable voices may provide additional validation. What better 
way for those questioning their results than to recognize the voice 
of the captured speech. Not that we can be sure of anything in this 
field but it could help if we feel we know who is coming through. :)--

found on the net to compare the voice AMAZING. I do believe you were 
speaking with the one and only Elvis. Very cool.&gt; k&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From:
