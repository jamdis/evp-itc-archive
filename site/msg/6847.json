{"id": "6847", "subject": "Ann in answer to your question", "author": "bhali333", "timestamp": "2008-02-05T23:52:22Z", "full_text": "Ann,\n \nI have come to the conclusion it is that when I receive a response\nlike &quot;wait&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll ask&quot; or &quot;not yet&quot; in response to asking for \ncontact with \nanother spirit other than a tech. The spirit that is asked for comes \nthrough \nin one of two ways depending on what spiritual plane that individual \nspirit resides on.\n \nI have been able to discern from communications with mike and Lisa \nthat there exists\nmore than one spiritual plane, the first is where our spirit awakens \nafter making the \ntransition from the physical. this is supposedly the only plane that \ncommunication with \nthe physical world is capable of being sent from.\n \nWhen a spirit moves from this first plane to the next changes in the \nenlightenment of the spirit take place.\nThe details pertaining to that are to complex to receive with our \nrudimentary equipment, evidently it can not be\nexplained in short phrases or sentences. which is completely logical.\n \nTo get back to the question, when a researcher asks for a spirit to \nbe brought forward so they can communicate.\nThe tech must locate that spirit energy and summon it to the place \nwhere the communication is facilitated.\nIf the spirit has moved on to a higher plane of existence it must \ntravel back to this lower plane to communicate.\n \nApparently spirits that have moved up can return to the lower \nspiritual planes but spirits that have not yet\nascended to a higher plane can not advance.\n \nI am assuming that when a spirit is called by a tech to communicate \nwith the physical if it is possible it will \njourney to the communication point. If it is not possible for the \nspirit to come to that point for whatever reason\nI expect that they try to form a communication link from one point to \nanother, and the tech must act as a telephone operator if you will.\n \nthat is the best way I understand how to explain it, I hope it \nanswers your question Ann.\n \nBruce"}
