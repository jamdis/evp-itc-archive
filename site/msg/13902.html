There are literally hundreds, if not thousands of these paranormal forum si=
tes popping up all over the place. It seems everyone wants to start their o=
wn site so they can espouse their vast "expert" knowledge and feel importan=
t.

Don't get me wrong, there are a few good ones out there. Now that it ha=
s become easy to start your own forum though, everyone is doing it.
