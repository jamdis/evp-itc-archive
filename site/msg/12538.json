From an aesthetic standpoint,\nI love the new 470 and it would be great to have a cheap am sweeper\nwithout that annoying chuffing sound on am sweep.\n\nthanks again Mike, you rock\nAndy\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot;\n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Close, but no audio.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did get the radio to sweep the bands without stopping yesterday, but\n&gt; there was no audio. Now if I can only duplicate that again... this time\n&gt; with audio.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was able to get the wire bundle connecting the two ends of the circuit\n&gt; board connector done this morning. And the radio still works just like\n&gt; when it was still all together.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I&#39;ve done is add a series of wires so I can access the underside of\n&gt; the circuit board containing the two ICs I want to manipulate. This wire\n&gt; bundle is soldered to on connector and plugged into the other. It allows\n&gt; the radios circuit boards to remain electrically connected.\n&gt; \n&gt; I took a video to show it still functions like right-out-of-the-box...\n&gt; but for how long...??\n&gt; \n&gt; Working with no schematic is really a challenge...  I&#39;m afraid I may fry\n&gt; the radio with one wrong probe.\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s a few pics of the wire bundle and circuit boards on my blog, at:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/10/newer-12-470-hack-progress.html\n&gt;\n&lt;http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/10/newer-12-470-hack-progress.html&#92;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike Coletta (UFO Geek)\n&gt;"}
