Asking for a &quot;Tech./Guide&quot; to show up and let me know who they are.  I&#39;ve been getting many names, but maybe those are ones that want to say &quot;Hi&quot; & who they are?!  I keep trying to record - daily or nightly.   =Judy=      ===============================                                --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann,\n&gt;  \n&gt; From what I can discern from mike and Lisa&#39;s communication regarding techs/guardians\n&gt; is that a tech is assigned to a researcher here on earth based on their compatible energy and harmonic vibration.\n&gt; That is not so easy to do, so every time you do a session there is a temp assigned for that particular session.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Give it some more time and keep asking but I&#39;m sure when you do get yours it will be a special relationship.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In other words you have to kiss the exact right frog for him to turn into your prince aah or princess \n&gt;  \n&gt; I will keep the subject open with mike and Lisa until I get a definitive answer or you do.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: lisby@...: Mon, 7 Jan 2008 11:27:46 -0500Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] A file from Frank&#39;s box #12 pertaining to lisby&#39;s technition\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hmmmm. That second bit gave me the creepies, I must say. What are your thoughts on that, Bruce? I hear Lisa&#39;s name at least a dozen times each time I run a session, so I feel confident that she is there, so I feel confident that I&#39;m not in the hands of someone I don&#39;t want to be in. Maybe they are still auditioning for the role? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Jan 7, 2008, at 9:49 AM, bhali333 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; the precedeing file was from a question about Ann&#39;s technition on 12-08-07Bruce\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Put your friends on the big screen with Windows Vista + Windows Live.\n&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/windows/shop/specialoffers.mspx?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_CPC_MediaCtr_bigscreen_012008\n&gt;"}
