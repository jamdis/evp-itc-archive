&gt; Hi Allen,
&gt; 
&gt; Looks like plans have changed and I won&#x27;t be at the Stanley Hotel 
&gt; paranormal event after all.  There was some sort of disconnect and 
my 
&gt; name didn&#x27;t show up on the guest list, so they couldn&#x27;t give me a 
&gt; room there. That&#x27;s what the hotel supervisor said last night 
&gt; anyway... and it&#x27;s too late in the game to follow this up.
&gt; He did say about 245 people will be in attendance, so you should 
have 
&gt; a good time.
&gt; Frank Sumption and I were both on their speaking agenda to talk 
and 
&gt; use some new devices for half the group at a time, but I heard 
Frank 
&gt; might not be able to make it either.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope to meet you and April at a future event sometime...

&gt; &gt; Mike,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I like the microphone. What did you use if you don&#x27;t mind giving
&gt; &gt; specifics?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; April and I will be at the Stanley also. We will be selling TAPS
&gt; &gt; merchandise and magazines. Stop by if you get a chance. We would
&gt; &gt; like to meet you.
