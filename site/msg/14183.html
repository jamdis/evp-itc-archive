For executables, you may be right. However, for wav files, the compression =
during email is not loss less. 

I used to think as you do, in that the ema=
iled attachment of a wav file would not loose anything. After a lengthy dis=
course with another member here, I learned that I was wrong. The reason why=
 I did not realize it in the first place is that when I would email a wav f=
ile, I would intentionally keep it in very small segments, to keep file siz=
e down. This was just for ease of transfer. But because of this, I had not =
experienced any noticeable loss.

Now it may be in some cases, depending on=
 the servers or what have you that the file goes through, that the loss may=
 be less or more. But once the attachment is downloaded, the quality has be=
en found to be less then the original wav.

Again though you can only reall=
y tell when the wav file is large.

        The kind of compress=
ion that occurs during an email attachment is "lossless": it compress the f=
ile cleverly without losing information.  For example, if I had a program i=
n some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it could compress it.  But if =
it lost even one bit, the resulting exe file would not execute again after =
it was uncompressed on the other side.

        This kind of compression do=
es things like looking for common patterns in the file, and replacing them =
with a token.  A rough example would be if it found "Howdy Neighbor" in a f=
ile 20 times, it could replace all the occurances with say $HN1.  And also =
write a little dictionary in there someplace that says "$HN1=3DHowdy Neighb=
or".

        When the file gets to its destination it can be uncompressed,=
 and all occurences of $HN1 are replaced with "Howdy Neighbor".  So it was =
compressed (instead of 14 characters each, it only needed 4, plus the dicti=
onary), but lost no data.

        Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not=
 lossless.  Depending on the level of compression, some level of data is lo=
st, and so cannot be recovered or reconstructed later.

          Another thing:

          I recently found this out. When you =
email a file, if it is not saved as a compressed format, the email filterin=
g process will actually compress the file automatically.

          So even=
 if you have attached a wav. file, it will loose resolution over the email =
process. It will not sound exactly the same as the original wav. file. How =
much it differs depends on the size of the file you are attaching. If it is=
 a very large file, it will sound much different.

          The only excep=
tion to this is if the wav. file is small enough that the filtering process=
 will ignore it. It has to be pretty small though, like under 1 MB (I am no=
t exactly sure of the threshold).

          The best way to share files ov=
er the internet if you want them as close to the original as possible is to=
 upload them directly to a website.

                  Pixelization doesn't clean-up th=
e data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a picture of a field of flowers, an=
d beginning to add levels or pixelization to the picture.  Soon, you would =
not be able to tell there were flowers there at all.  You would see a lot o=
f colored blocks.

                  Or in the other direction, imagine you=
 are looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on your screen: a comp=
lete screen of truely random static snow.  Pixelizing this, after a while, =
you would again start to see colored blocks.

                  What's happ=
ening is that it is processing an area of the image, taking (for instance) =
the average value of that entire area, and replacing all the blocks in that=
 area with the average.  In video processing, this would result in a field =
of multi-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-blu=
ish block, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise example, it maybe =
replace all the random pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.  If yo=
u did not know beforehand what the original picture was, you couldn't tell =
whether your pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, the sk=
y with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.

                  It works the=
 same with the sound files.  Taking something as complex as speech, and rep=
lacing frequencies with their averages, loses the speech the farther you go=
, until you head strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the same to rando=
m static will eventually produce the same thing.  And random fluctuating sq=
uare waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, you could have fun sh=
aring with each other what you thing they 'sound like'.

               Be a bit careful of formats like mp3 if you are doing a deta=

                                So mp3 migh=
