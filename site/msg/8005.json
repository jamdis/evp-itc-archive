I didn&#39;t get any results with that box as I told you before in the other group.  Of course I took it back and I stuck with my 469, because my tech didn&#39;t like the radio either.  My question is if I accidentally cut the wire left of the MU wire would that affect the reception with the radio?\n   \n  William Rees\n  \n\nbhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n          \n\nHey guy&#39;s,\n\nHere are a few from a session with the 125 a couple of day&#39;s ago.\n\nFor the new people that may be working with the RS 12-469 and would \nlike to have a box without the clicking on AM and also an internal \nspeaker and telescope antenna.\n\nYou should give this 20-125 a shot!
