I have yet to \nget a direct response on the meaning, maybe they are not ready to say \nwhat it is just yet.  I just randomly search for the meaning of the \nnumber 7 and see if anything makes sense, while i wait for them to \ntell me what is their meaning behind it.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Steve,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for posting this as it gives more food for thought on Seven.\n&gt; It&#39;s been astounding how it seems to have been consistent for so \nmany\n&gt; to be getting that number.

Seven represents the enlightened person, full special \n&gt; &gt; &gt; orientation, awareness of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; manifestation. Seven represents perfect groupings, fullness of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; planetary and angelic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; orders. Seven symbolizes perfection of order, energies and \n&gt; &gt; spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; principals. Seven \n&gt; &gt; &gt; represents eternal life and the perfection of a complete cycle. \nIt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; symbolizes a fresh start \n&gt; &gt; &gt; after a cycle has been completed and positive regeneration. \nSeven \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the fullness of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; space and time and the fullness of the universe in motions. \nThrough \n&gt; &gt; &gt; its hidden \n&gt; &gt; &gt; properties, the number seven maintained all things in being, \n&gt; &gt; mundane \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and spiritual, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bestowed life. Seven is the number of crowning achievement.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A modern interpretation of the number seven affirms that you \nare on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the right spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; path and that what you are working on creating is very close to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; coming into being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This seems to make the most sense to me so far about the #7 \nsome of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; us have been getting.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
