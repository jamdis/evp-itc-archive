Although, I could not hear the tape for some reason as it  did not come \nthrough, and I am having problems with Gold Wave so, I can&#39;t  filter out the \nstatic,  I have to learn how to operate these other  kind of recording \nsoftware devices. My mother was born in 1927, and  her voice was really light, \nthat&#39;s one thing our family has in common, the  women all seem to have the \nsame type of voice, my daughter sounds, like me, my  cousin sounds like my \ndaughter, my mother, grandmother, aunt, we kind of sound  much the same in tone \nand vocalization.  If I could hear that file,  I would know her voice.  \nIt&#39;s probably because of the ancestors, my  grandmother who was Ransom married \na Stebbins, then 100 years before that  the geneology show&#39;s a Stebbins \nmarried to a Ransom, and this goes back, plus  A Ward/Ransom cross was there, \nand a Stuart/Stebbins, cross, and a  Stuart/Clark, so over the years this \nvoice type or sound was kind of some how  got ingrained.  I am wondering if the \n1927 was my mom, her voice was very  light, and that year was very important \nto her, because when she was little  she as a baby crawed out on a pier, at \na place back then called the &quot;devils  wash bowl&quot; it was where my great, \ngreat grandfather, a Ransom lived in  Old Misson, MI he had collie dogs, and \nhad a big male called Tasso, when  mom as a baby fell in this very deep water \nhe jumped in and pulled her to  shore, don&#39;t know how she managed to get out \non that pier in the first place,  but she would have drowned if not for \nthat dog.  So, September 4,1927  was/is her birth day, and in 1928 she almost \ndrowned, at about 10 or  11 months old.sf\n \n \nIn a message dated 5/15/2009 10:58:23 A.M.
