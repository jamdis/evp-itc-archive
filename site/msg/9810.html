I was really sad when Steve died and the speech Bindi gave at his 
memorial was so touching. I havent seen her show yet but I think it 
is so cool for him to have his daughter to carry on his passion.

&gt; Hi Kay.  Steve&#x27;s daughter Bindi has her own show:  Bindi The 
Jungle Girl (on Discovery 
&gt; channel).  She&#x27;s a little cutiepie.  You&#x27;ll have to keep us 
posted!

&gt; &gt; OMG Margaret that&#x27;s too funny. I will have to ask if it is him. 
I 
&gt; &gt; use to watch Crocodile Hunter all the time I loved that show. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I played back that second session I recorded and I hear him 
&gt; &gt; say &quot;GIDDAY&quot; twice.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Kay.  Maybe it&#x27;s Steve Irwin?  :-)
