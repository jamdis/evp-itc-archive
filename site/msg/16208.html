F-S, I certainly hope I didn't offend you with anything I said.=A0 I certai=
nly do not claim to be a braniac or a know-it-all, as you have called me in=
 your post.

In fact I am saying the opposite: I am saying that I do not kn=
ow:=A0 I am saying I do not know how anyone can believe these 2012 predicti=
ons when all they have is stories and questionable claims.=A0 I don't know =
how they can believe this stuff when they actually DO have evidence that al=
l the similar claims in the past have been shown to be false. I do not know=
 why they believe this claim is any more justified than all the others,

I =
do not know how the group can say on its home page " It's one thing to be s=
keptical, it's another to ignore and deny all evidence.", yet it is the peo=
ple who are certain of the 2012 prophecies that seem to be ignoring and den=
ying evidence that it is only one more in a long line of unsupported failed=
 predictions, not those who are skeptical of it.

I do not know how it just=
ifies you referring to me as=A0 a "wanne be brianiacs claiming to know all"=
, when the group home page suggests such attacks get people banned.=A0 I do=
 not know how being skeptical of a future prophecy makes one a know it all.=
 And I do not know how prompting people to judge for themselves makes me a =
know it all. 

And I don't know why the group home page says a good argumen=
t is ok, yet you start name-calling offended when someone questions somethi=
ng you do not agree with, or proposes a theory alternate to your own.

So c=
all me ignorant.=A0 Obviously I really don't know very much at all.=A0 

Bu=
t of the very few things I do know, I now it is good to question, and not t=
ake everything, especially prophecies, at face value.=A0 And I know the bes=
t way to test a prophecy, and the people making them, is to see if they act=
ually come to pass.=A0 And I know that since no evidence can support a prop=
hecy's truth until it comes to pass, and since all past end-of-world prophe=
cies have no evidence of their success, that those who think they know some=
thing special about why 2012 is different, certainly know more than I.

And=
 so I hope they (or you, if you count yourself among them) will post your e=
vidence, and your predictions, and your dates.=A0 And we won't have to argu=
e about it.=A0 We can just put that person, and their predictions, and thei=
r dates, on our calendars, and judge when the date comes, who was really ac=
ting as a know-it-all.=A0 

One thing I think we can all agree on:=A0 one k=
nows it all. Not me, not you, and certainly not a collapsed MesoAmerican ci=
vilization.
