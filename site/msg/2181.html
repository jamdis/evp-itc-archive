<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Can you ask them to do something in these images that would indicate  
they are paranormal? I hate to say something like tell them to hold  
up a sign that says Hi Frank! but.....

Did they tell you they wanted you to go this, BTW?

&gt;  Just the way they look, like the portrait images are like floating  
&gt; in a sea of black, yet some are coler images, the others are to big  
&gt; for the screen, like amateur video. I wouldn&#x27;t say they are all  
&gt; paranormal images, only that most are interesting, and probably  
&gt; something.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  BTW, thanks to those who did take a minute to look!

&gt; Ok--now don&#x27;t get wiggy on me, Frank--but what makes you think  
&gt; these are not random broadcast images?

&gt; When you say connected to cable, what do you mean?

&gt;  Same as the voices I get, with a randomly tuned VCR tuner, removed  
&gt; from the VCR, and connected to cable. The tuner has line level  
&gt; video and audio out. I use a monitor to view the video, then  
&gt; &quot;captue&quot; it with the digital camera in camcorder mode.  As with the  
&gt; voices, you can&#x27;t rule out with 100% certainty that it isn&#x27;t  
&gt; broadcast fragments, but a face surrounded in black!?
&gt;
&gt;  These are from last night, at around 6pm.

&gt; Frank--how was this recorded? I can&#x27;t comment on the images at all  
&gt; unless I understand how you&#x27;re getting them.

&gt; It looks really cool, tho&#x27;.

&gt;  Yeah, a woman with her face so close to the camera that the top of  
&gt; her head is cut off, and ya can almost see her nose hairs. Probably  
&gt; see that all the time on MTV.
