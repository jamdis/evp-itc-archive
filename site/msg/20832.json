And how we can change the amplitude , the level , and offset . There are only a 1 potentiometer . \n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Urkel23&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; You can get any frequency you want, you just have to work out the proper values according to the radio.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Luis&quot; &lt;luispucp098@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Hi steve , many thanks for your attention , i visited your web , and i saw the kit , it says and shows the circuit , but , it not says what range of frecuencie is available to bring . I can`t buy this kit , because i am in Peru , but , i can make this circuit , but i was thinking make the opamp frank`s circuit , because i can ask him if there are problems , and know the frecuencie is it available to bring . I didnt know i can contact you in this forum , so , i know now , and i ask you about the values to get 0.16 hertz or less . \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Urkel23&quot; &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve had much success with using different variations of this:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://store.qkits.com/moreinfo.cfm/QK23\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I contacted the company and bought just the pcb&#39;s for $3.25 each.  Every radio needs a different set up, so i just buy the boards and adjust to what i&#39;m working on.

This circuit can work whith this frecuency ? ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
