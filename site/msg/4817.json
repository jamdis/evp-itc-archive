I have attached a file where they repeatedly ask for me by name (which could not be the radio, given the odds the radio would not be saying my name over and over quickly).  The final message was conference call at the end of the clip.  At that time, I was actually getting a conference call from Bruce and Steve via Skype and I had no way of knowing since the conference call came through on my other laptop in my office.\n   \n  On another session, one of my Daughter&#39;s walked into my office and upon entry (never speaking a word) they said &quot;Hello Alexxis&quot;.  This actually freaked her out.  She never said anything but yet they acknowledged her presences as she walked in the room.  Once again what are the odds that you would get all of my members of my families names correct that happen to be in the room during a session?  \n   \n  Juli\n   \n  \n\nbabiarz3 &lt;babiarz3@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hi LC.

It led me to start hounding Frank for a box of my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; own, and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later to buy a minibox from Rick, since poor Frank was beset on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sides. ;)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We&#39;ve already had some spectacularly burning arguments about &lt;BR&gt;&gt; what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris claims his guides or technicians tell him behind closed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; doors. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, no audio of this is public, so his claims &lt;BR&gt;&gt; can&#39;t be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaluated. I think the proliferation of people getting results &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the boxes belies his assertion that only 30 are chosen.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n Ann&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Dec 30, 2007, at 11:09 PM, Robin Henson wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think some of you were discussing this recently, but I&#39;m &lt;BR&gt;&gt; wondering&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what you all think.
