Yeah, I do seem to get answers to question with my Ghostman box (one of a =
kind Mini box). the Ghostman is a combinatin of the linear sweep and an AM/=
FM radio with direct out put, no sound chamber  or mics. I have kinda palye=
d wiht white noise, but not for about six years. There's some ideas about u=
sing tone generators instead of radio.

ject: [EVP-ITC] introducing myself




Not really new to the group, been lu=
rking for a few months just reading, listening, and studying.Unfortunately =
I'm not much of an engineer so I've been picking up books to help me better=
 understand the technical side of the boxes. I understand the practicality =
of them (ie- creating random white noise to allow EVPs to be formed) but I =
hope to gain an understanding of how they work technically in hopes of buil=
ding and tweaking my own.For me EVP has been something I've been into all m=
y life without knowing what it was (I'm 30 now, I first learned the technic=
al term about 22 or 23) - I guess I'm what people would call "sensitive" or=
 whatever. But besides that, early on I was fascinated by seemingly coheran=
t sounds that would come out of random noise on my clock radio in my bedroo=
m as a kid, from what sounded like voices (thought I was crazy for a while)=
 to even morse code - for a long time one of my radios would produce random=
 clicks or pops even when the speaker was off. My dad jokingly suggested it=
 was morse code, so I studied morse code and discovered that at least some =
of it could be morse letters...usually they would spell one word and then g=
ibberish.Anyways, once I learned what EVP was I began messing around with r=
ecorders etc. My first clear recording came from using EVP maker and was so=
meone saying "we have been waiting for you." A few days later, after a frus=
trating lack of communication they just told me "build a box.(this happened=
 to be after I learned of frank.)" I've been looking at all the boxes and t=
heir positives and negatives and this is what I'm seeing:Franks models seem=
 to produce the most consistant results but also seem to be less two way th=
an some others (ie Joe's Box.) Joe's Box and the new radio shack mod seem t=
o have some very clear voices coming through but skeptics can argue that al=
l you are hearing is snippets from radio broadcasts.My thought for a cost-e=
ffective, low-tech alternative is to combine the two in that you create a r=
adio shack mod like the UFOGeek one (multiple radios, a mixer, etc) and run=
 it through an echo box.Personally I believe that analog is giving the best=
 results overall, and I think it has to do with ease of manipulating the si=
gnal. Therefore my thought is taking a digital white noise signal like that=
 produced by the radio shack mods and then essentially broadcasting it into=
 the echo chamber and having a mic pick it up gives you the analog aspect.M=
y question is has anyone tried this? And I was hoping for thoughts on the p=
ros and cons of using AM vs. FM or both.Oh, one other thing- any programmer=
s/engineers out there? Someone that could write code to allow us to randoml=
y band scan a digital radio?
