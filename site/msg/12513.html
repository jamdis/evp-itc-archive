<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes. It&#x27;s amazing how many who claim to be Christians are clueless  
about their own history. Of course the early church didn&#x27;t allow such  
knowledge and it was much easier to control people who didn&#x27;t know  
about their dirty deeds. Only Priests were allowed to read for a good  
long time. Crazy. Keep people uneducated &amp; afraid and you can do  
pretty much anything with them. This is rampant in the US today.  
Frightening to me such insanity and ignorance still exists in 2008.  
Stunning!

&gt; Correct, and a lot of that appropriation happened during the several

&gt; Christianity and then moved on to others over time. That&#x27;s where you
&gt; have things like the King James Bible appear out of (during the later

&gt; &quot;devil&quot; and &quot;demon&quot; (which one depends on which version of KJ you
