One has a message from Arthur and the two I can only speculate about.  \n   \n  These files were recorded by me during a 2 minute session.  I was NOT able to get the wording out of the recordings so I asked for Bruce&#39;s help.  In short order this is what he picked out.  To me they are pretty spectacular in length, content and clarity.  Thanks again Bruce...some day.  Ron L\n\n __________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
