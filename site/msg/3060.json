I am \nhoping you can answer.\n\n     When listening to some of the messages you currently have posted \nlike the message regarding Tesla, why is it that some come thru so \nvery clear and audiable to understand vs. others?  Most of mine audio \nI have gotten from the boxes are very clear to hear outright.\n\n      Second question?  In those who have tested it at a proposed \nlocation, have they ever gotten addition evp relating to the messages \ncoming over the box?  The reason I asked is because I have.  When \nvideo taping the box being used, I got a warning of sorts prior to \nthe message from the box.  Has anyone else experienced this?\n\n      Third, has anyone ever gotten into a heated debate with someone \nover the box. A two way conversation that had the potential of \ngetting nasty?  Or things that came across that were not nice?\n\nI would love to know if anyone has experienced any of this events.\n\nThanks!\nJuli"}
