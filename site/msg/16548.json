The\nmessages&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; rece=\r\nived are for the user, and rarely does anyone hear the\nsame thing as the&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; original listener.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does that mean =\r\ntwo people can&#39;t use it together? How would\nthey know which&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe message was for if they do? Or is it best to only use it\nalone?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On *Thu, 1/7/10, Zack Widup &lt;a rel=3D=\r\n&quot;nofollow&quot; class=3D&quot;moz-txt-link-rfc2396E&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:w9sz.zack@...&quot;=\r\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dw9sz.zack@...&quot;&gt;&lt;w9sz.zack@. =\r\n..&gt;&lt;/a&gt;* wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Zack Wid=\r\nup &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; class=3D&quot;moz-txt-link-rfc2396E&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:w9=\r\nsz.zack@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dw9sz.zack@...&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nw9sz.zack@. ..&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] W=\r\nhat does it do?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://mc/compose?to=3DEVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups =\r\n.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, January 7, 2010, 10:40 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think a=\r\nny of us know really who or what the\n&quot;entities&quot; are.

The tuning is swept across the\nenti=\r\nre band, AM or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; FM, the resulting bits of speech, music, a=\r\nnd noise are\nused by the enitites&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as a raw material to bu=\r\nild their voices from. The sweep\ncan be linear,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; random, o=\r\nr manual, and it does not have to cover the\nentire broadcast band.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; This is one method and device for providing the raw\naudio, and if=\r\n you&#39;re&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tesitng to see if it&#39;s just broadcast fragments, =\r\nconsider\nthis-the concept&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is the same as EVPmaker, EVPmak=\r\ner runs on a computer, the\nentities&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; manipulate that raw a=\r\nudio *inside* the conmputer, and if\nyou think stray&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; RF is=\r\n going to get *inside* the hard drive and mix with\nthe audio file&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; you have no clue how any technology works.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; Testing is irrelavent! It&#39;s not the device, it&#39;s the\nuser.
