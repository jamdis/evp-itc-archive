<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Those are the IF, or intermediate frequency transformers, they are set 
at the factory to pass a 455khz signal. Radio staions are converted 
from whatever frequency they are on to the 455khz IF freq. for better 
amplification, ans selectivity. When you adjust those you&#x27;re screwig 
with the IF pass band, which usually is not a good thing. You&#x27;ll 
probably notice other parts of the band no longer receive, or stations 
over lap. 
So Now you need a 455khz oscillator, tune a staiton, and adjust the 
transformer for strongest beat signal. 

 The red core is the local oscillator, the white and black the IF 
transformers. So you&#x27;ll also need a freq counter to get the thing back 
in tune. 

 Tehre is a sot onthe board where a wire can be added that helps the AM 
reception a little, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend screwing with it.

 I think get a book on basic radio fundamentals.

&gt; I found an old 12-469 from RadioShack and compared to the newer one, 
the
&gt; reception is real bad. I opened it up and noticed red, white, and 
black like
&gt; screws. I decided to play around with them and noticed that it changed
&gt; reception and how loud the stations come through. Has anyone else 
played
&gt; with these? I&#x27;m trying to adjust them to get better reception, but 
can&#x27;t
&gt; quite get the reception the way I want it. Is there a way I can add a 
copper
&gt; coil or anything to boost the reception? I attached some images for 
everyone
&gt; to see. Any suggestions would be great.
