&gt; Wow, this is def. weird. I just got this. A real evp while doing a
&gt; sweep with my RS Hack. You&#x27;ll hear me say: &quot;Anything you&#x27;d like to
&gt; say?&quot; and all else is spirit. Sounds to me like a Brit accent saying
&gt; &quot;I think you&#x27;re beautiful.&quot; which is common as he tells me through the
&gt; Ovilus, Robot Box, and now recording live.
&gt;
&gt; There&#x27;s an odd noise before the male voice and a mumble after. Very
&gt; weird. There was nothing except the RS Hack on at the time, but this
&gt; didn&#x27;t come over the radio.
