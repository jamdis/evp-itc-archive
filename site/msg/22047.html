<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m so very sorry to hear about your pneumonia and breast lump!  Hope both go away very quickly, and that the breast lump turns out to be nothing!  Athena

&gt; For having 900 members, this board is a ghost town. When i first joined this 
&gt; group in 2007, it was the only group dedicated to this and it was a rockin&#x27; 
&gt; forum. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We used to get between 1500 to 2000 posts a month, now it gets like 15 to 20 
&gt; posts a month. Not sure what happened here. If each member here posted twice a 
&gt; month, it would be like 1800 posts.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m sure that somebody has to have something to say.

&gt; &gt; Maybe I should post here - it is hard to get any feedback for my files on two 
&gt; &gt;other forums. Athena

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Very crisp sound, Steve. On the AM, I heard a woman&#x27;s voice saying &quot;We want 
&gt; &gt;to talk to you...&quot; at 0:23.
