          I agree, Larry! (and I am a psychic, lol)
         =
 I did not watch the show because my group and I were actually out investig=

EVP-ITC] Door To The Dead


            I have to admit that I thought I ha=
d seen the worst 'paranormal' show on television already. I was wrong. Door=
 to the Dead has exceeded my worst expectations.

            Generally, I =
respect John Oliver's work as a medium. While I have no personal experience=
 with him, in the past he has looked and acted more genuine than not, the r=
olling of the eyes put aside for the moment.

            I do take excepti=
on to the characterization of the talking box as an Edison device. I have d=
ocumented the history of Edison, ITC and EVP  elsewhere. This is however th=
e smallest concern I have with this show.

            Prior to wathcing I =
had just had a conversation with a respected colleague on the West coast re=
garding interesting phenomena he and others are constantly observing in sit=
es with phenomena similar to that on Door to the Dead. None of those measur=
ements were made by this team. The use of thermal in this situation is not =
indicated as well.

            The real concern is that no attempt was mad=
e to help this family in a broader context. The skeptic did and said nothin=
g skeptical as far as I could tell. Key questions were not asked (at least =
on-camera) that would reveal the psycho-dynamics of this family. We know fa=
irly well at this time that PK phenomena is often centered on a focal perso=
n who can exhibit specific characteristics. That the team seems unaware of =
this is quite disturbing to a person like myself.

            A real resea=
rch opportunity was lost in this case, as was an opportunity to educate the=
 public on the right way to approach such situations. Continually sending t=
he messages that phenomena is based on 'demons' and 'spirits' exclusively d=
oes nothing to further the position of serious investigators, which is perh=
aps most troubling of all.
