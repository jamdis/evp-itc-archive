<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I didn&#x27;t realize people thought of me that way frank, sometimes i 
believe my name is used in conjunction to a statement i&#x27;m not aware 
of.  I don&#x27;t know much about electronics and that&#x27;s why if you read 
my post from yesterday i referred Kay to ask you about how the box 
works.  I never claimed to know anymore than the next person, i don&#x27;t 
believe i have an ego either.  I&#x27;m still learning and always trying 
new things to stay refreshed in what i&#x27;m doing here.  I know you no 
longer like me for whatever reasons you have, but i don&#x27;t go bashing 
you on public forums.  Some call that cheap shots, i only speak about 
you with respect and will continue to do so.  As a matter of fact, 
yesterday i called myself a dopey box researcher.  Does that sound 
like i&#x27;m above the rest?

&gt;  Told ya! Let the friggin&#x27; entities talk, and you might get 
&gt; something more meaningful, but then that wouldn&#x27;t justify the ego 
&gt; crap, and the so called theories, and paranormal expertise.  So 
what 
&gt; good is it doing to ask all the &quot;right&quot; questions when you get 
vague 
&gt; junk back!? You have to let go the presumptions, and everything you 
&gt; think you know. 
&gt; 
&gt;  What makes you two(Steve and Bruce) think you are so special that 
&gt; you can get the answers to technology questions when they don&#x27;t 
even 
&gt; tell me, Stefan, Bill, Ron, or any physical techs anything! At 
least 
&gt; we could implement any technical suggestions. Y&#x27;all wouldn&#x27;t know 
&gt; microfarad from a microbus(VW). 
&gt; 
&gt;  I think your guides quit talking cuz you&#x27;re both are ego tripping 
&gt; into outter space. Yet you&#x27;re pissed cuz I wouldn&#x27;t allow myself to 
&gt; obligated to you for &quot;donations&quot;. 
&gt; 
&gt;  I been tryin&#x27; to hold back, but this girl&#x27;s still got hair trigger!
&gt; 
&gt;  So &#x27;nuff public venting!
