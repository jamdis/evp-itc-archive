rank's Box and Chris Moon


I am concerend because Chris Moon is using Fran=
k's box under his name to make money. He 
charges $250 for a half hour sess=
ion with this box. I wouldn't be so irritated had he just 
called it someth=
ing else, but this is Frank's and it should be up to Frank how this box is =
used. 
I think using it to make money is wrong. I am not saying it would be=
 wrong for Frank to 
market it it, at a reasonable price, but to charge $25=
0 for a session that is under the 
interpretation of Chris Moon is just pla=
ying on those who are suffering from a loss and 
looking for a connection.
