I just got this. A real evp while doing a\n&gt; sweep with my RS Hack. You&#39;ll hear me say: &quot;Anything you&#39;d like to\n&gt; say?&quot; and all else is spirit. Sounds to me like a Brit accent saying\n&gt; &quot;I think you&#39;re beautiful.&quot; which is common as he tells me through the\n&gt; Ovilus, Robot Box, and now recording live.\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s an odd noise before the male voice and a mumble after. Very\n&gt; weird. There was nothing except the RS Hack on at the time, but this\n&gt; didn&#39;t come over the radio.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wisteria\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\nThanks Rhonda!
