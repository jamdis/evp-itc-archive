You are right-if you have to do too much enhancing to hear something, then =
you just can't call it EVP.

But that really doesn't mean that there isn't =
anything there, because there could be, but it isn't good enough to be cons=
idered.

You can tweak and play with a recording as long as you want, so lo=
ng as you always keep the original in pristine condition for comparison. Wh=
en I go to process my audio, upon opening the track, I immediately save it =
to another name so that I am sure not to accidentally save over the origina=
l.

If you have tweaked the audio to the point that it is completely unreco=
gnizable from the original, I would say that may be too far.

"Are we just =
making ourselves believe there is something there??"

Unfortunately I think=
 alot of the times we are. It is called pareidolia, or matrixing. It is a n=
atural functioning of our brains to pick out familiar patterns out of rando=
mness. Like faces in the clouds and sounds in white noise. This make our jo=
b of deciphering what is authentic EVP and what is just matrixing very diff=
icult. You can't even trust yourself entirely.

Now before Frank kicks my b=
utt on that, I need to state the disclaimer that this is only if we wish ou=
r evidence to stand up to scientific scrutiny. I do know that there is some=
 value to gut feelings, but gut feelings won't get you anywhere in the scie=
ntific world.

  Now I may be biased to the "inve=

 can't make it out do to ambient noise.  So hear is my question.  When do y=

e the more enhancing you do the less convincing it becomes.  I hope noone f=

g, was there really something there to begin with.  Are we just making ours=
elves believe there is something there??
