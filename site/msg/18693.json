With that, you can control step in Hz, Rate, \nDwell and track an analog input for a random mode. \n \nHere is a link with one at pretty low cost.\n\nhttp://www.arduino.cc/\n \n\nI don&#39;t know how involved you wanted to get, but i was thinking of using this myself.

I do know that it is based off of the MK484 chip, which frank uses in his TRF boxes so he might have that for you.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also know that each box changes and is different, i have a page of some of those schematics.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.stevehultay.com/ghostboxschematics.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps you,\n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Shaun Burris &lt;paranormalmaster1@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hey guys and gals im trying to build a new type of minibox design does anyone \n&gt; &gt; have the systems breakdown for a franks box or mini??\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
