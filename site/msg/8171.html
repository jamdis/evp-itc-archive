Michael:
                Set it so you can hear it, just like your listening to the radio.  When you start to tune it in, prior to scanning, listen and see what is best for you.  After you think your ready, then start the scanning process.  The two way communication in real time will not come right away.  You are going to need to adjust your earing which does take time, to hear it while doing a session.
   
                 Could I suggest that you try your session two ways?  Run a session, NOT asking questions.  This will allow your ear to get intune.  Frank does this when he is conducting sessions and tuning in his boxes.  Give them a chance to express any messages they might have and you will out rule the chance of talking over them and missing any responses.
   
                  The second is the question & answer session.  You ask a series of questions, and upon the responses, continue with the conversation.  This does take time, but does come.  
   
                    These have worked very well for me in the past and continue to use them as common practice today.  
   
                    There is nothing more rewarding when your have an awesome session!  It's a high like no other!
   
                    Best of luck!

            At what volume should I set the radio at, so I can hear a response from a spirit?
   
  Right now, I can not hear any responses, and have to wait until playback.
   
  If i set it too loud will that loudness drown out a response I may get?
   
  Thanks in advance for your thoughts!
