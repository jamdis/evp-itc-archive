<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce, I heard your name at least three times in the recording. Even 
when I asked am I the one getting the phone call, the reply was not 
yes or no, but &quot;Bruce.&quot;

I believe from the session it will be a spirit call - it could come 
physically, through a phone, but then I wonder if it could mean 
something else I have not thought of?  Hang in there, buddy...

&gt; LC,
&gt;  
&gt; I have recieved a communication from mike and lisa saying that I 
would recieve a phone call.
&gt; Also Juli has gotten the same message about me. 
&gt;  
&gt; I hope they don&#x27;t call collect that would be a hell of a long 
distance call :)
&gt;  
&gt; all kidding aside I hope they are talking about a spirt call, I 
know a number of the first itc 
&gt; researchers back in the day like Mark Macy, George Meek and Maggy 
Fishbach recieved
&gt; spirit phone calls.
&gt;  
&gt; I&#x27;m hoping that these calls mean I am to be equally blessed.
&gt;

&gt; The file is uploaded. I ask if they know anything about a phone 
call. They reply, &quot;Phone call? Bruce. That&#x27;s Bruce. I ask if I&#x27;m 
getting it and they say again, &quot;Bruce.&quot;LChttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com
