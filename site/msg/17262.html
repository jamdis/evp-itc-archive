there is anything to this, and if so, lets try and understand cause and eff=
ect.

I have never said you were crazy, at least publicly LOL Nor do I thin=
k you are a bad guy or anything like that.=C2=A0 I just think there are som=
e strong fundamental problems with this idea from the start.=C2=A0 Once I c=
an get past that, then no problem.
