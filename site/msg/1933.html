<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Frank-R;

Yahoo marked your message as spam, and I can&#x27;t go approve it from here at 
work. But anyway, I don&#x27;t know if I should name names, in an attempt to be a 
nicer bitch. I don&#x27;t get it, I made the damn things, gave them away free, 
yet I can&#x27;t be trusted to fix it, or at least verify the box works for me. I 
think there may indeed be a limit, or at least a certain state of mind for 
users. So I guess these people are left with ugly little door stops? I tried 
to e-mail  but one e-mail came back, the other ignored,  so I&#x27;m thinkin&#x27; 
blocked maybe, which does not show they are anymore honest then the user 
they all hate------without naming names. BTW-Steve&#x27;s not one of these 
people.


This probably sounds vague, but they know who they are, and I don&#x27;t get a 
response any other way, so probably a mis-use of the group, sorta.


I didn&#x27;t realize just how crappy car tuners were until I got the homebrew 
tuner working. I don&#x27;t have anywhere near the static and noise in the HB 
tuner.
