First off.............
 
Wherever you are at with the Ovilus 1 you have to =
let the spirits there  
learn how to communicate thru the unit before you c=
an effectively communicate  
with them.  You do this by telling the spirits=
 that you have this device  and 
that you want to communicate to them thru =
it.   And that they have  to learn how 
to communicate thru it before you c=
an begin.  So you let the  unit run by 
itself for 30 to 60 minutes.  After=
 all the random ramblings  coming from the unit 
have slowed or calmed down=
 then you will be able to  communicate and start to 
receive answers that w=
ill make sense to you.  Its  as simple as that.
