     I'll give him this: he has amazing balls to be using Frank's device and tell ing the rest who are also using them that his is the only one that works. If I were Frank, I'd be beating my head against the wall. Oh. Wait. He already is.  

 What a total load of ego-driven crap. 
 

 Chris, if you're reading, may I suggest that you are the one who is falling victim to "false" communication? Or that your head is getting waaaay too big? Or if you already know that you're just in it for the cash, that you find another way to pay your bills?
 

 You know, though, this same shit has happened to every group of paranormal researchers since the field began. I've watched group after group come together and explode for thirty years because only the Chosen had the right to control the message, would broke no criticism of *any* of their own results *ever*, but had plenty of definitive pronouncements about everyone else's.
 

 This is why I scoff at the idea of "Harmony," with the capital H. I have seen the concept used by everyone from the Warrens in the 60s-70s to the Harsch-Fischbachs in the early 80s to Moon today trying to use this idea of being somehow chosen and sacred in order to get "real" messages from spirit. Harmony is a way to control who gets to play and IMHO, it's a load of nonsense.
 

 Bruce, I have to tell you that the message you got the other day about us being all Kumbaya set my alarms off, perhaps innocently, but nonetheless. I've found there is such a fine line between real peace between brothers working for the real common good and peace between brothers as a mechanism of control. Yes, we need to be at peace to work together. But that peace has to be an inclusive peace. It has to be a peace within one's self above all else. It needs to be a *fearless* interior peace, too. The Harmony is within, folks. It's not judging whether others have it or not before we let them play. It is pure, unadulterated *internal* knowledge about one's self. Judge not, lest ye be judged--remember that one?
 

 HMO YMMV, toujours,

a panic because his fraudulent buisness is going down the tubes. he

matter what means you use it's the researcher that counts.

and if moon is so omnipitent in this research where are the 
documented recordings of his research, why are they not public for 
everyone to hear maybe because he's full of bull. he said recently 
that no one but him gets legitimate communication, well I think it's 
the other way around. 

chris if you read this, stop the cherade and have some dignity. 
become a real researcher and stop trying to down everyone else so you 
can continue to pray on the berieved and desperate people. And while 
I'm at it, if your so great why are you offering substantial 
discounts to your so called ghost hunter university. I'll tell you 
why, because people are starting to realise you are nothing but a 
carnival side show palm raeder and have fooled people long enough. 

the reason I am addresing moon directly on this group is I know he is 
lurking in the shadows to see what is happening with real researchers 
and will know at least what I think of him.
I have done more legitimate box research in one week than he has done 
ever. My results are posted I challenge him to do the same.

here is a copy of his malicious blog from myspace.

The Box has hit the fan! 
Current mood: distressed 
Category: Dreams and the Supernatural 

As so many of you know, I have been the primary tester of the 
Telephone to the Dead, a.k.a. "Frank's Box" since 2004, and have had 
great success using it in paranormal research, and more currently, 
connecting the living with those on the other side. I have recently 
been made aware that there are several replica versions of this 
device being sold. I have also been told of another device that can 
be purchased for very little from any electronics merchant and 
altered by hand, producing what some consider to be results. As I 
expected, the samples that people have sent me are nothing more than 
timed radio scans that have no validity. 

What is important to remember, before purchasing any of these replica 
devices, is that the Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides on the 
other side have repeatedly explained that the way that the Telephone 
to the Dead technology works, is by spirit energy manipulating the 
random voltage generator (RVG) and using white and pink noise, as 
well as radio fragment, to create real time voice answers to 
questions posed from our side. The most important aspect to this 
device is the medium operator who works as an antenna 
or "interpreter" for living individuals asking the questions. 

Thomas Edison, in an intelligent spiritual discussion through the 
Telephone to the Dead, stated that there were only thirty of these 
individuals that could effectively use the device. Four have been 
identified to this point. 

I have spent nearly four years testing and doing paranormal research 
with the Telephone to the Dead, and I have built strong relationships 
with Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides who I trust, and who trust 
me. These new "radio scanners" are not only a waste of money for 
people looking to do research with them in hopes of having effective 
communication with the other side, but may in fact be very dangerous. 
Should demonic and other negative entities learn to use these false 
devices, the results could be devastating. Though I rarely see eye to 
eye with the Catholic Church on the matter of using the Telephone to 
the Dead, I do admit that they predicted the widespread sale of false 
communication devices as far back as last year. I have recently begun 
to receive requests from individuals asking for help to close 
negative doorways and portals that they believe they opened using 
their purchased Telephone to the Dead replica. Others are claiming 
that I am a fraud because their purchased device doesn't produce the 
positive results I have been fortunate enough to have, and claim that 
therefore, all of my results MUST be false. 

I can see this spiraling out of control already. Once again, I will 
continue my research with the actual Telephone to the Dead as well as 
provide public demonstrations and private readings for those truly 
interested in real time spirit communication. Please feel free to 
contact me with any questions at

Bruce
