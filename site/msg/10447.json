This one has a very usable AM/FM \ntuner that does use the analog tuning voltage, so I can use it in a \nbox. All radio functions are in the module itself. This radio was \nunusual in that all the pins and connections were labeled. Usually I \nuse a scope and voltmeter to id the pins of the module looking for \noperation voltages, which is usually 8 volts, mode pins, such as a pin \nthat is for AM or FM, and goes to 8 volts, or sometimes 5 volts for the \ngiven band. I also look for any other enable voltages, inputs, and \naudio outputs, and the anttena pin(s). Junk yards usually want $10 each \nfor junk radios, and many times they just are not usable. This one was \n$3!\n\n What I said about box concerns, maybe just suffice it to say, use at \nyour own risk, there probably isn&#39;t any danger, and personally I \nhaven&#39;t encountered anything I would relate directly to the box. \nHowever, that&#39;s not to say I haven&#39;t had encounters of an apparent \ndemon kind. Just troublesom parasitic entities that once discovered \nquickly leave, not a big deal. I don&#39;[t want to get that serious wiht \nthis. Now if everyone that uses the hack box goes bananas....\n\n Frank-S"}
