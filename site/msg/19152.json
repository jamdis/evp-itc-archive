I told them, yeah I\ntalk to bugs--bite me and I gas everyone of ya! They stay outta sight. So\nthis was recorded in the garage last night &quot;Us, (or house) Spiders Speak&quot;\nat 15 seconds. Brain is not mind, anything that lives, thinks, ghost voices\nare thoughts. If man thinks he is so advanced, how many can control eight\nlegs and spin a web? How many eyes does a fly need if there is no intellect\nto process the information? Humans vastly underestimate the rest of nature.\nHuman ego, unjustifiable.\n\n These big radios make better boxes because the quality of the radio is\nbetter. Better front end, not so easlily overloaded by strong nearby\nsignals, and better IF filter(the down conversion process), less surious\nsignals, clearer sound. Larger audio amplifiers, and less distortion.\n\n F-S\n\nMy wo k oom ou in he ga age, and spide s come in. I old hem, yeah I alk o bugs--bi e me and I gas e e yone o ya! They s ay ou a sigh .
