yeah, supposedly there have been some deaths there. The investigators that have alot of experience have been tryin to locate this bridge. The is virturally NO information about it. When you ask other groups/investigation teams, they dont know anything. Well, we were out hunting and happened to stop at this bridge, its NOT in use, its an old bridge off the side of the road, supposedly kids used to use it to walk back n forth to school way back when. Well, the sensitives in the group started getting sick, and feeling horrible about what was there. We were all standing at one end of the bridge where they were talking. They all started telling us to shusssssh lol ( iwas recording the whole time. Right after they <the investigators><sensitives> told us to shush, the evp was on that tape. After we left there we crossed this other bridge, leaving the area, as soon as i got to the end of the bridge my car died. One of the group took a digital of my car and there were orbs
 everywhere! I went back there friday with the same group, but i didnt record. Trhis time i took pictures, the same spot where i got that evp i got orbs. The theroy is that no one is supposed to know about this bridge, and obviously those who know are not telling. This bridge is easly visable from the road, its right next to it, and the whole arewa has a hisstory of hauntings. The railroad tracks the missions are out there etc etc. So, i dont think these spirits want to be bothered. I would like to go there one more time but given what has been happening to me, im not really sure thats so wise now. I saw an adult in black or a black figure come outside with my youngest yesterday. When i looked up there was no one there, i thought it was my oldest, but when she came outside i asked her if she just came out with Heaven <my youngest> she said NO. I had parked my car somewhere else on that trip, and when i opened the door to my car to go home that night, as soon as i opeend it,
 it felt like someone was in my car. I drove home scared shitless the whole way. then yesterday i saw that "person"
  thanks for listenning to that evp. It helps to have help that can do a much better job cleaning them.
