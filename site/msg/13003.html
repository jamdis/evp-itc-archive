Hi Chuck! Nice to hear from you. Being that I wasn't there and I=A0and many=
 of my associates on this forum and others have had very strange experience=
s also, I will take your words for truth.=A0To bad you got broke in the way=
 you did. It sounds like you are a tad bit clairaudient. This is a talent m=
ost of us have to work at but there are those who it comes natural to. A lo=
t of people on this forum are so deep into EVP/ITC they forget they could b=
e committed for the voices they hear also. Shame on them for anything but e=
ncouraging words. Hell, I have a friend who is adept at recording with wate=
r and an aquaintance here in my hometown who can hear the voices directly f=
rom running water without a playback. So its not too crazy to believe what =
has happened to you.

While reading your story the overwhelming theme was f=
ear. You were constantly afraid of what would happen if you did this or tha=
t. If you followed their instructions by opening the door or anything else =
they did. It was all engineered to instill and create fear in you! You are =
too afraid! Normally if you were just dabbling with this stuff I would say =
leave it alone because your not ready. Since you seem to have had it thrust=
 upon you I will share some information with you.

Very near our own physic=
al plane is a very dark plane where the barely=A0conscious, materialistic a=
nd flesh obsessed spirits exist and dwell. Some are completely benign and o=
thers entertain themselves with the misery of others. There are also those =
who constantly ask for your help. The meaner of the ones I mentioned will c=
uss and pick, lie to you and threaten but besides maybe some minor physical=
 (haunting) activity they are really physically harmless. On a psychologica=
l level they can be very damaging if you are not prepared for their antics.=
 One of the things you need to know about this dark ring around our physica=
l world is that it is monitored by controllers or gatekeepers. They allow o=
nly certain things to pass from level to level. Most of the spirits of this=
 area are aware of their presence and some are not. 

If you hear from thes=
e spirits again deal with them as you would with any person giving you prob=
lems. Tell them with authority you want to speak with the gatekeeper. It is=
 a term they know, I have heard them use it. If the gatekeeper comes on and=
 you trust it to be one then request that the former channel be closed and =
request a new (higher) channel of communication.

Remember, like attracts l=
ike and fear generates hate. Do not be afraid of these things, they are aro=
und you whether you hear them or not. If you want more information please e=
mail me privately.

Regards,
Frank R.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Any insight on my life=
 changing EVP experience?


My name is Chuck and I stumbled upon this site =
and its information 
while trying to figure out what's going on in my crazy=
 life. Before I 
get into that let me explain a bit about myself. I am a ma=
le in his 
30's, who has Bachelors in Regional Development, with a minor in=
 
Computer Science. I work at a respective power plant company within 
Ariz=
ona doing GIS Tech Work. I get drug tested at it on random 
occasion and I =
really only drink socially, or on some holiday 
occasions. I have always be=
en a logical kind of thinker my whole life 
and never really had any "belie=
f" in the paranormal, even though my 
mom and brother strongly do. 

I feel=
 so weird even trying to explain this story because about a 
week ago I wou=
ld have thought of it as silly. About a year ago I met 
someone else, who f=
or now ill call B. I fell madly in love with her 
and after a short time I =
was more than happy to have her come and 
live with me at my new place. In =
some strange way I always felt as if 
there was something about B I could n=
ever quite understand. After 
about 3-4 months of living with her I started=
 to get the inclination 
that B was cheating on me. Her stories never added=
 up, her job was 
secretive and she started stumbling on her words a lot. 
=

I then started getting spy gadgets, because she was staying with me 
and I=
 was concerned about my place along with her activities there. I 
at first =
just got a digital recorder, but then after time I started 
to get aggravat=
ed and felt that the digital recordings were just 
being used to play and t=
aunt me. So then I went to the extent of 
getting Cameras and even Camcorde=
rs. Whenever I would ask about 
something peculiar, I got tears and a reall=
y heartfelt reaction that 
really made me believe her. I felt like we reall=
y loved one another 
and I could really see some care in her eyes, so most =
of the time I 
just gave in to what she said as true, but didnt have enough=
 to stop 
looking. I felt like I had been in enough relationships to know t=
he 
difference here. I have seen the act before and it really didn't look 
=
that way here, unless she was just really that good at fooling 
people. 

D=
uring the course of our stay there she would pitch a huge fit if I 
had to =
leave her at the apartment alone and would stop at nothing to 
try and be i=
n my company instead. But I started to get aggravated as 
time progressed a=
nd knew something was up, because of the odd voices 
I would hear within th=
e recordings. I made her stay there will trying 
to sneak back and see who =
was messing with her around my place. I 
lost it because I couldn't pinpoin=
t it at all and last July and got 
into a fight right outside of my place w=
ith three other people. She 
always told me she talked to her self when I q=
estioned other voices 
and I never could see anyone else there when she did=
, even with the 
cameras, so I had no choice but to continue on believeing =
her still=85=85
even though my feelings wouldn't agree to her words. 

For =
some odd reason it just seemed as if she knew where the cameras 
and record=
ers were every time, just by the way she would exit and 
enter the apartmen=
t. So then I started putting them outside and about 
a month ago something =
crazy happened. I started listening to a 
digital recording and at the begi=
nning of it I flat out heard B 
cheating on me with someone. I was upset an=
d happy at the same time 
that I finally had caught it and as a result I se=
nt her away. She 
left town because all her family was in another city. She=
 couldn't 
stop crying and was hysterical, especially when she saw I was 
d=
evastated too. I thought that I had finally gotten my answers and 
she was =
just the best actress I had ever known, end of story. She 
tried to kill he=
rself a couple of times while this was going on a 
couple months back. If i=
t was as an act or not, I really just don't 
know. But when she left last s=
he left a note telling me not to let 
her die and she hopes that I find her=
 soon before her heart stopped. 
Me=85..I said more BS and threw the note i=
n the garbage. 

A couple of day's later curiosity got the best of me and I=
 started 
listening to the rest of the recording. I then started to hear wh=
at 
sounded like people monitoring ME and calling me a "Threat". I 
immedia=
tely start acting alarmed. Then in the recording I hear B exit 
the apartme=
nt in disgust after I stormed off that night, as we were 
fighting about so=
mething weird yet again. After I had left she 
started talking about settin=
g up a "Private Meeting" with some other 
people and something about boatin=
g. Well during the beginning of this 
meeting I heard a reference to a craz=
y accusation that I had made at 
B awhile ago, which to me at the time conf=
irmed she was in the Mafia. 
That explained all the weirdness to me and dur=
ing this meeting the 
voices changed a bunch as if they sounded "Masked" or=
 "Disguised", so 
I really had to amp up the volume. 

The next day and eve=
ry day after from this point on I amped up the 
volume in the recording. I =
also had to distinguish the masked voice 
by breaking the large file into s=
maller segments of two to four 
second intervals, in order to piece the ent=
ire recordings meaning 
together. Over time I started to interpret the mask=
ed voices better 
because I thought I was tuning my ears better to them. Th=
e voices in 
these recordings were two different males, B and some other fe=
male. I 
later on saw in the recording that they had actually seen the 
rec=
ording but weren't taking it, which was EXTREMELY odd to me 
considering th=
ey had been caught. Why not destroy the evidence? 

Then I heard one of the=
 males say that he was the "Boss of the 
Southwest Mafia" and that I was go=
ing to pay for hurting B like this. 
He also said that my being a nuisance =
in the apartment had messed up 
his business within the area and all my spy=
 stuff had really pissed 
him off. He told me I was dead, my daughter along=
 with me and more 
than likely my whole family as well. 

He knew where my =
mom and dad lived and some information I didn't even 
tell B. I freak out a=
nd figure the damn mob is after me. I keep 
listening and he says "If I don=
't move away and discontinue my 
interactions with my daughter by December =
5th, that he would know 
that I was just playing with B and then my whole f=
amily is dead". 
This was exactly one month from when I had used the record=
ing device 
too by the way. I moved out and away from my daughter breaking =
the 
tie and in tears the whole time too because I couldnt explain why. I 
=
really did it because I feared for their lives of my family and felt 
that =
we would all die if f I didnt. 

Meanwhile B and met someone else that ill =
name J for now. After 
knowing him for two days she decided to bring him ba=
ck with her to 
pick up her things out of the apartment. I was kicking her =
out of it 
by the way. I thought it was just to piss me off and I forgot ab=
out 
it. Then I heard as I progressed in the recording J's name brought 
up=
. Supposedly they knew him and he was in their mob and I needed to 
go atta=
ck him to prove myself, or else B will never be seen from me 
again. I also=
 hear that I can't go to certain places at certain times 
where B might be =
and furthermore think that they didnt take the 
recorder because the damn t=
hing has to be planned down to the times I 
would hear it. 

At this time I=
 am in fear for my life and my families, lost my love 
and I am not underst=
anding how the recording is so damn well time 
planned, figured im going cr=
azy. Then something ill never forget 
happens. I am spoken directly too and=
 I figure its me going of the 
deep end now. I try and test my sanity and g=
o to different parts of 
the recording only to get the same thing kind of d=
irect question. I 
am in disarray at this point! I stand up and walk around=
, trying to 
figure out just what the hell is going on with me. I get back =
on and 
further see that my verbal questions are now being answered instant=
ly 
by this recording (Which is merely a sound file on the pc). *I was 
usi=
ng Sound Forge by the way if anyone wanted to know what sound 
software I w=
as using was*.

I have so little sleep at this point and I am told that I n=
eed to do 
all this crazy stuff and drive out to the middle of some hotel r=
ight 
then and there, to further see them, as I have passed all their tests=
 
to get into their mafia now. As a reward B would be there waiting for 
me=
 too. I hurry to do it and rush there but no one is even their to 
answer t=
he door. I go back and get a yelling voice at me that I had 
left to early =
and immediatly go back. Me not wanting to piss the mob 
boss anymore, I tak=
e the 45 minute trip again and go back. But when I 
get there it just didn'=
t feel right to me and I never exited the car, 
especially when I saw the n=
umbers in vehicles hadnt changed in the 
parking lot. I had plenty reason t=
o be paranoid at this point and 
truly felt in danger.I left and thought I =
was done for when I got 
back. Instead, he tells me that he was impressed b=
y my decision when 
and literally puts me in tears when he said that becaus=
e of my 
intelligence, I had won my families lives back, but not my own yet=
. 

All this is done by him also telling me that he can physically see me 
=
through his advanced mafia technology on the computer monitor. He 
also tel=
ls me to to move things around on my compter desk that were 
between the si=
ght of me and the computer monitor, while demanding I 
correct my posture w=
hen speaking to him. He also states that he is 
watching my every move and =
if I tell anyone anything they die along 
with me. 

I make no sense of thi=
s and I was completely baffled on how I was 
being communicated with. I had=
 just moved and there was no internet 
connection even. Me just being happy=
 my family is safe, I decide to 
go to sleep. Feeling as though I am now sl=
eep deprived and going 
crazy from the stress, I go to sleep for two days c=
onsistently, as 
this was during the Thanksgiving holiday time. I would pur=
posely make 
myself sleep longer when I woke to ensure I didn't belong in t=
he 
loony bin. 

When I finally woke up I was determined to find an explana=
tion to how 
they were talking to me, I go to the library and look into Blu=
etooth 
technology, telephony, and remoting into a computer=85..anything. T=
hen 
I realize=85=85..that I can find out just how crazy I really am by mov=
ing 
the recording and listening to it elsewhere. I then decide to take 
th=
e same recording into my work to test my saneness, along with the 
file its=
elf. If its was on my home CPU=85.then it's going to now be at 
my work one=
 too right? I do and get the same damn thing, not to 
mention that the "Mob=
 Boss" now has company two others when I speak 
to him. All of them yelling=
 at me for moving their sensive 
information. 

During this time I invest i=
n GPS, GSM, 3G and several signal blocking 
devices, in order to prohibit m=
yself from being tracked any further. 
They never worked or even phased the=
 "Mob Boss". But I would still 
check the recording in the evening just to =
hear what I needed to do 
in order to be making them happy and get the poss=
ibility to see B 
again. The "Mob Boss" had told me that it was all just a =
test for me 
to see if I loved her and she never really did do anything. Th=
ey 
continue to tell me over and over that I have to beat up J in order 
to=
 prove myself to B. That this is what everyone is really waiting on 
and if=
 I would just go up to the other town and get it over with, 
then I can bri=
ng her back with me. I won't do it and say that I won't 
fight for anything=
 that doesn't want to be fought for. Basically 
saying that B can call me a=
bout it if she really wants it. Then as a 
result they start threatening my=
 family again. At this point, I 
really can't even express to you how much =
of a wreck I am. But I felt 
like I needed to be strong for my family and g=
et on the mob's good 
side so I can fix the mess I created.

Well it never =
really happened and this torment went on for a good 
week, while I was movi=
ng everything I could as fast as I could in 
order to make their deadline a=
nd save everyone. Everyday I would do 
what I thought was expected of me an=
d hope it wouldnt make them mad 
in one breath, while in the other breath w=
in back my complete 
freedom, away from their bad side. No matter where I w=
as or what I 
did during the day they usually seemed to know about it when =
I talked 
to them in the evening. It really bothered me that I couldnt find=
 out 
where they were putting the "bugs", or even better how they were 
doi=
ng all of it. My inability to "believe" in the paranormal really 
hurt me h=
ere.

Since the apartment that B and I had used was empty at this time and =

a friend of mine was down on his luck, I gave him the apartment for 
free =
until the lease was completely up. After about a week of me 
doing this, I =
walked in and found guns and ammo everywhere and 
freaked the hell out. Tha=
t's the last thing I needed when I thought 
the mob was just down the stree=
t! I made everyone there except my 
friend leave, with quite a fuss I might=
 add. Then I headed back to my 
home to see how the mob felt about what I d=
id, assure they would be 
impressed that I had looked out for them. Instead=
 the regular female 
that was always with the "Mob Boss" now asked me why I=
 didn't finish 
the job, stating that there was still someone there and it =
made them 
all angry. They demanded that I go back especially to see just h=
ow "I 
finished it". 

So like the puppet I was at that time, I went back. =
I didn't have the 
heart to put him on the street, even though he had put m=
e at a major 
risk and instead I just found another place for him to stay. =
On the 
way there I bought him some water and some smokes. When we got ther=
e 
I even helped him move in and explained that it wasn't me that did 
it, =
but the leasing office had saw all the guns. As a result they had 
made me =
do it. I thought he made a poor decision and I knew he saw 
the same, not t=
o mention I kind of felt bad that I had to do all of 
this to him at 11:30P=
M. I truly didnt want to make his life a 
complete hell any more than it al=
ready was and he felt better that I 
had talked to him, so as a result I di=
d as well. I then left and once 
again headed back home. 

Certain that I w=
as going to get good praises; I sat at the PC again 
only to immediately ge=
t yelled at. They asked me why I was "so good" 
and that they had absolutel=
y no respect for me. I tell them I just 
did all of that for them and they =
say that I always do things "the 
right way" and they hate me for it. This =
is where I think I hit the 
loony bin and just didnt see how I was going to=
 fix this problem. 
Then it got worse and saw that my thoughts were now bei=
ng 
communicated back to me. Then I knew it and was convinced I was going 
=
skitzo and that i was just truly arguing with myself in reality, 
especiall=
y when I saw I wasn't even speaking. I used the restroom, 
splash water on =
my face and faintly start to hear the same mob people 
in my fan motor in t=
he bathroom. I haven't drank, done any drugs 
(even prescription) and have =
a pretty complex job which I can still 
handle, but yet I feel like I am go=
ing crazy. 

I can't talk to anyone about it so I sit back at the CPU, only=
 to 
hear that I need to open up the front door. Screw that!=85I just look =

out the window and see nothing and say no way. They ask why not and 
that =
I should trust them and I say hell no and I continue to 
hear "God Damnit" =
from them when they get mad. They continue to ask 
me to open the door and =
I continue to check the window to see 
nothing. I say to knock then and the=
y get mad and say they have no 
hands. They don't sound like they are jokin=
g and get mad when I laugh 
even, so I continue to think I am just crazy at=
 this point. I asked 
why they wanted to come in and they said they wanted =
to fix me. I say 
there is nothing wrong with me and they say they hate me =
and want to 
eat me.

I start to really think about this and say ill open t=
he door if I get 
the answers to all this. They start saying things and its=
 if as 
though they see my thought process develop and say things like=85"w=
atch 
him go". Then I hear out of my computer monitor something I couldnt 
=
even fathom. I hear my ex-wife's ex-best friends voice. His name was 
Danie=
l and he had committed suicide over 5 years ago. I did know him, 
but not a=
s well as she had. It WAS his voice and he said "Charles its 
Daniel" and t=
hen I heard their voice again say we are "down here with 
him". At this poi=
nt I didnt know really what to think, but this part 
in our conversation wa=
s the turning point on my beliefs and thoughts 
on what was really going on=
. 

I say nothing yet they somehow can seem to hear my thoughts and start 
=
saying little things to make me think even more. It was the most 
fluent co=
nversation I had ever had. It was truly telepathic and was 
on a level I co=
uld never really explain even to myself. Then it 
really hit me and I said =
"Demons". I tried to play something and got 
no response for the first time=
 ever on the sound file. I then started 
piecing it all together from there=
 and even though I wasn't a 
believer this makes more sense then I could ev=
er write down here and 
as a result I forever will be one now. 

They ask f=
or me to now open the door and I open the small glass door 
on my CPU desk =
and they get really pissed off, saying I tricked them. 
Then their voice ch=
anged to the most demonic, vile and disturbing 
voice I could ever put into=
 words. I never really thought of doing 
that until that moment and I think=
 it was seen from them reaction, 
but it worked out quite nicely. I start s=
aying the our father prayer 
and I can hear the displeasure in them even mo=
re and heard "that's it 
we are going in". I immediately took off my headph=
ones and ran to get 
a bible they never did as far as I can tell, but I sat=
 there all 
night with the bible in my hand praying. 

I started calling pe=
ople and my phone started cutting out, the bulb 
on the porch blew and my g=
ood friend's girlfriend called me to ask me 
for help because my friend was=
 drunk and passed out. It sounded like 
she was trying to flirt with me and=
 I asked her how "A" nightclub was 
and she said good and then I said didn'=
t you actually go to "B" 
nightclub actually and she switches her story. I =
hang up and call 
back with no answer. The time was only 1:10am and they ne=
ver leave 
until the clubs close so this was even odder. 

I sat there terr=
ified most of the night praying, until I called my 
brother who told me tha=
t I have to stand up to them or I am feeding 
into their fear. He like my m=
om has been involved in similar things 
like this but after talking to both=
 of them, neither have on this 
level. But in a refreshing breath after tal=
king to them about this, 
they did seem to believe me. But it wasnt unil I =
researched this 
issue and found out about EVP and how it works, did I trul=
y know that 
I wasnt becoming a lunatic.

That brings me to today and me be=
ing at my wits end. I swear on 
everything this is all 100% true and I feel=
 like I am crazy even 
still. Even though I hear it from no one else and ha=
ve a pretty good 
circle of friends, not to mention that I still seem to do=
 my job just 
fine as well. I havent put on my headphones or heard any voic=
es since 
I tried to last listen to the recording, which was now 3 days ago=
. 
Does anyone have any help and guidance here, as this all has really 
des=
troyed my life. I deleted all the copies of the recording, except 
for one =
hardcopy. I still have the original recorder with the file 
on, but I haven=
't tried to use the recording or recorder any further, 
as I refuse to cont=
inue it without any guidance. I figure its best to 
avoid them, like my bro=
ther said. Maybe someone can help me 
understand all of this. Even if I hav=
e gotten rid of these things 
what does that say of B? I really spent a bun=
ch of time making this 
really need some genuine help from someone in the k=
now. I know it 
sounds crazy but please regard this all as true. I am new t=
o this 
stuff and will just stay away from it now, but some kind of insight=
 
would be great.

oned will cuss and pick, lie to you and threaten but besides maybe some min=
or physical (haunting) activity they are really physically harmless. On a p=
sychological level they can be very damaging if you are not prepared for th=

our physical world is that it is monitored by controllers or gatekeepers. T=

<DIV>If you hear from these spirits again deal with them as yo=

<DIV id=3Dygrp-text>
<P>My name is Chuck and I stumbl=
ed upon this site and its information <BR>while trying to figure out what's=
 going on in my crazy life. Before I <BR>get into that let me explain a bit=
 about myself. I am a male in his <BR>30's, who has Bachelors in Regional D=
evelopment, with a minor in <BR>Computer Science. I work at a respective po=
wer plant company within <BR>Arizona doing GIS Tech Work. I get drug tested=
 at it on random <BR>occasion and I really only drink socially, or on some =
holiday <BR>occasions. I have always been a logical kind of thinker my whol=
e life <BR>and never really had any "belief" in the paranormal, even though=
 my <BR>mom and brother strongly do. <BR><BR>I feel so weird even trying to=
 explain this story because about a <BR>week ago I would have thought of it=
 as silly. About a year ago I met <BR>someone else, who for now ill call B.=
 I fell madly in love with her <BR>and after a short time I was more than h=
appy to have her come and <BR>live
 with me at my new place. In some strang=
e way I always felt as if <BR>there was something about B I could never qui=
te understand. After <BR>about 3-4 months of living with her I started to g=
et the inclination <BR>that B was cheating on me. Her stories never added u=
p, her job was <BR>secretive and she started stumbling on her words a lot. =
<BR><BR>I then started getting spy gadgets, because she was staying with me=
 <BR>and I was concerned about my place along with her activities there. I =
<BR>at first just got a digital recorder, but then after time I started <BR=
>to get aggravated and felt that the digital recordings were just <BR>being=
 used to play and taunt me. So then I went to the extent of <BR>getting Cam=
eras and even Camcorders. Whenever I would ask about <BR>something peculiar=
, I got tears and a really heartfelt reaction that <BR>really made me belie=
ve her. I felt like we really loved one another <BR>and I could really see =
some care in her eyes, so
 most of the time I <BR>just gave in to what she =
said as true, but didnt have enough to stop <BR>looking. I felt like I had =
been in enough relationships to know the <BR>difference here. I have seen t=
he act before and it really didn't look <BR>that way here, unless she was j=
ust really that good at fooling <BR>people. <BR><BR>During the course of ou=
r stay there she would pitch a huge fit if I <BR>had to leave her at the ap=
artment alone and would stop at nothing to <BR>try and be in my company ins=
tead. But I started to get aggravated as <BR>time progressed and knew somet=
hing was up, because of the odd voices <BR>I would hear within the recordin=
gs. I made her stay there will trying <BR>to sneak back and see who was mes=
sing with her around my place. I <BR>lost it because I couldn't pinpoint it=
 at all and last July and got <BR>into a fight right outside of my place wi=
th three other people. She <BR>always told me she talked to her self when I=
 qestioned other
 voices <BR>and I never could see anyone else there when s=
he did, even with the <BR>cameras, so I had no choice but to continue on be=
lieveing her still=85=85<BR>even though my feelings wouldn't agree to her w=
ords. <BR><BR>For some odd reason it just seemed as if she knew where the c=
ameras <BR>and recorders were every time, just by the way she would exit an=
d <BR>enter the apartment. So then I started putting them outside and about=
 <BR>a month ago something crazy happened. I started listening to a <BR>dig=
ital recording and at the beginning of it I flat out heard B <BR>cheating o=
n me with someone. I was upset and happy at the same time <BR>that I finall=
y had caught it and as a result I sent her away. She <BR>left town because =
all her family was in another city. She couldn't <BR>stop crying and was hy=
sterical, especially when she saw I was <BR>devastated too. I thought that =
I had finally gotten my answers and <BR>she was just the best actress I had=
 ever
 known, end of story. She <BR>tried to kill herself a couple of times=
 while this was going on a <BR>couple months back. If it was as an act or n=
ot, I really just don't <BR>know. But when she left last she left a note te=
lling me not to let <BR>her die and she hopes that I find her soon before h=
er heart stopped. <BR>Me=85..I said more BS and threw the note in the garba=
ge. <BR><BR>A couple of day's later curiosity got the best of me and I star=
ted <BR>listening to the rest of the recording. I then started to hear what=
 <BR>sounded like people monitoring ME and calling me a "Threat". I <BR>imm=
ediately start acting alarmed. Then in the recording I hear B exit <BR>the =
apartment in disgust after I stormed off that night, as we were <BR>fightin=
g about something weird yet again. After I had left she <BR>started talking=
 about setting up a "Private Meeting" with some other <BR>people and someth=
ing about boating. Well during the beginning of this <BR>meeting I heard a
=
 reference to a crazy accusation that I had made at <BR>B awhile ago, which=
 to me at the time confirmed she was in the Mafia. <BR>That explained all t=
he weirdness to me and during this meeting the <BR>voices changed a bunch a=
s if they sounded "Masked" or "Disguised", so <BR>I really had to amp up th=
e volume. <BR><BR>The next day and every day after from this point on I amp=
ed up the <BR>volume in the recording. I also had to distinguish the masked=
 voice <BR>by breaking the large file into smaller segments of two to four =
<BR>second intervals, in order to piece the entire recordings meaning <BR>t=
ogether. Over time I started to interpret the masked voices better <BR>beca=
use I thought I was tuning my ears better to them. The voices in <BR>these =
recordings were two different males, B and some other female. I <BR>later o=
n saw in the recording that they had actually seen the <BR>recording but we=
ren't taking it, which was EXTREMELY odd to me <BR>considering they
 had be=
en caught. Why not destroy the evidence? <BR><BR>Then I heard one of the ma=
les say that he was the "Boss of the <BR>Southwest Mafia" and that I was go=
ing to pay for hurting B like this. <BR>He also said that my being a nuisan=
ce in the apartment had messed up <BR>his business within the area and all =
my spy stuff had really pissed <BR>him off. He told me I was dead, my daugh=
ter along with me and more <BR>than likely my whole family as well. <BR><BR=
>He knew where my mom and dad lived and some information I didn't even <BR>=
tell B. I freak out and figure the damn mob is after me. I keep <BR>listeni=
ng and he says "If I don't move away and discontinue my <BR>interactions wi=
th my daughter by December 5th, that he would know <BR>that I was just play=
ing with B and then my whole family is dead". <BR>This was exactly one mont=
h from when I had used the recording device <BR>too by the way. I moved out=
 and away from my daughter breaking the <BR>tie and in tears
 the whole tim=
e too because I couldnt explain why. I <BR>really did it because I feared f=
or their lives of my family and felt <BR>that we would all die if f I didnt=
. <BR><BR>Meanwhile B and met someone else that ill name J for now. After <=
BR>knowing him for two days she decided to bring him back with her to <BR>p=
ick up her things out of the apartment. I was kicking her out of it <BR>by =
the way. I thought it was just to piss me off and I forgot about <BR>it. Th=
en I heard as I progressed in the recording J's name brought <BR>up. Suppos=
edly they knew him and he was in their mob and I needed to <BR>go attack hi=
m to prove myself, or else B will never be seen from me <BR>again. I also h=
ear that I can't go to certain places at certain times <BR>where B might be=
 and furthermore think that they didnt take the <BR>recorder because the da=
mn thing has to be planned down to the times I <BR>would hear it. <BR><BR>A=
t this time I am in fear for my life and my families,
 lost my love <BR>and=
 I am not understanding how the recording is so damn well time <BR>planned,=
 figured im going crazy. Then something ill never forget <BR>happens. I am =
spoken directly too and I figure its me going of the <BR>deep end now. I tr=
y and test my sanity and go to different parts of <BR>the recording only to=
 get the same thing kind of direct question. I <BR>am in disarray at this p=
oint! I stand up and walk around, trying to <BR>figure out just what the he=
ll is going on with me. I get back on and <BR>further see that my verbal qu=
estions are now being answered instantly <BR>by this recording (Which is me=
rely a sound file on the pc). *I was <BR>using Sound Forge by the way if an=
yone wanted to know what sound <BR>software I was using was*.<BR><BR>I have=
 so little sleep at this point and I am told that I need to do <BR>all this=
 crazy stuff and drive out to the middle of some hotel right <BR>then and t=
here, to further see them, as I have passed all
 their tests <BR>to get int=
o their mafia now. As a reward B would be there waiting for <BR>me too. I h=
urry to do it and rush there but no one is even their to <BR>answer the doo=
r. I go back and get a yelling voice at me that I had <BR>left to early and=
 immediatly go back. Me not wanting to piss the mob <BR>boss anymore, I tak=
e the 45 minute trip again and go back. But when I <BR>get there it just di=
dn't feel right to me and I never exited the car, <BR>especially when I saw=
 the numbers in vehicles hadnt changed in the <BR>parking lot. I had plenty=
 reason to be paranoid at this point and <BR>truly felt in danger.I left an=
d thought I was done for when I got <BR>back. Instead, he tells me that he =
was impressed by my decision when <BR>and literally puts me in tears when h=
e said that because of my <BR>intelligence, I had won my families lives bac=
k, but not my own yet. <BR><BR>All this is done by him also telling me that=
 he can physically see me <BR>through his
 advanced mafia technology on the=
 computer monitor. He <BR>also tells me to to move things around on my comp=
ter desk that were <BR>between the sight of me and the computer monitor, wh=
ile demanding I <BR>correct my posture when speaking to him. He also states=
 that he is <BR>watching my every move and if I tell anyone anything they d=
ie along <BR>with me. <BR><BR>I make no sense of this and I was completely =
baffled on how I was <BR>being communicated with. I had just moved and ther=
e was no internet <BR>connection even. Me just being happy my family is saf=
e, I decide to <BR>go to sleep. Feeling as though I am now sleep deprived a=
nd going <BR>crazy from the stress, I go to sleep for two days consistently=
, as <BR>this was during the Thanksgiving holiday time. I would purposely m=
ake <BR>myself sleep longer when I woke to ensure I didn't belong in the <B=
R>loony bin. <BR><BR>When I finally woke up I was determined to find an exp=
lanation to how <BR>they were
 talking to me, I go to the library and look =
into Bluetooth <BR>technology, telephony, and remoting into a computer=85..=
anything. Then <BR>I realize=85=85..that I can find out just how crazy I re=
ally am by moving <BR>the recording and listening to it elsewhere. I then d=
ecide to take <BR>the same recording into my work to test my saneness, alon=
g with the <BR>file itself. If its was on my home CPU=85.then it's going to=
 now be at <BR>my work one too right? I do and get the same damn thing, not=
 to <BR>mention that the "Mob Boss" now has company two others when I speak=
 <BR>to him. All of them yelling at me for moving their sensive <BR>informa=
tion. <BR><BR>During this time I invest in GPS, GSM, 3G and several signal =
blocking <BR>devices, in order to prohibit myself from being tracked any fu=
rther. <BR>They never worked or even phased the "Mob Boss". But I would sti=
ll <BR>check the recording in the evening just to hear what I needed to do =
<BR>in order to be
 making them happy and get the possibility to see B <BR>=
again. The "Mob Boss" had told me that it was all just a test for me <BR>to=
 see if I loved her and she never really did do anything. They <BR>continue=
 to tell me over and over that I have to beat up J in order <BR>to prove my=
self to B. That this is what everyone is really waiting on <BR>and if I wou=
ld just go up to the other town and get it over with, <BR>then I can bring =
her back with me. I won't do it and say that I won't <BR>fight for anything=
 that doesn't want to be fought for. Basically <BR>saying that B can call m=
e about it if she really wants it. Then as a <BR>result they start threaten=
ing my family again. At this point, I <BR>really can't even express to you =
how much of a wreck I am. But I felt <BR>like I needed to be strong for my =
family and get on the mob's good <BR>side so I can fix the mess I created.<=
BR><BR>Well it never really happened and this torment went on for a good <B=
R>week,
 while I was moving everything I could as fast as I could in <BR>or=
der to make their deadline and save everyone. Everyday I would do <BR>what =
I thought was expected of me and hope it wouldnt make them mad <BR>in one b=
reath, while in the other breath win back my complete <BR>freedom, away fro=
m their bad side. No matter where I was or what I <BR>did during the day th=
ey usually seemed to know about it when I talked <BR>to them in the evening=
. It really bothered me that I couldnt find out <BR>where they were putting=
 the "bugs", or even better how they were <BR>doing all of it. My inability=
 to "believe" in the paranormal really <BR>hurt me here.<BR><BR>Since the a=
partment that B and I had used was empty at this time and <BR>a friend of m=
ine was down on his luck, I gave him the apartment for <BR>free until the l=
ease was completely up. After about a week of me <BR>doing this, I walked i=
n and found guns and ammo everywhere and <BR>freaked the hell out. That's
 =
the last thing I needed when I thought <BR>the mob was just down the street=
! I made everyone there except my <BR>friend leave, with quite a fuss I mig=
ht add. Then I headed back to my <BR>home to see how the mob felt about wha=
t I did, assure they would be <BR>impressed that I had looked out for them.=
 Instead the regular female <BR>that was always with the "Mob Boss" now ask=
ed me why I didn't finish <BR>the job, stating that there was still someone=
 there and it made them <BR>all angry. They demanded that I go back especia=
lly to see just how "I <BR>finished it". <BR><BR>So like the puppet I was a=
t that time, I went back. I didn't have the <BR>heart to put him on the str=
eet, even though he had put me at a major <BR>risk and instead I just found=
 another place for him to stay. On the <BR>way there I bought him some wate=
r and some smokes. When we got there <BR>I even helped him move in and expl=
ained that it wasn't me that did <BR>it, but the leasing office had
 saw al=
l the guns. As a result they had <BR>made me do it. I thought he made a poo=
r decision and I knew he saw <BR>the same, not to mention I kind of felt ba=
d that I had to do all of <BR>this to him at 11:30PM. I truly didnt want to=
 make his life a <BR>complete hell any more than it already was and he felt=
 better that I <BR>had talked to him, so as a result I did as well. I then =
left and once <BR>again headed back home. <BR><BR>Certain that I was going =
to get good praises; I sat at the PC again <BR>only to immediately get yell=
ed at. They asked me why I was "so good" <BR>and that they had absolutely n=
o respect for me. I tell them I just <BR>did all of that for them and they =
say that I always do things "the <BR>right way" and they hate me for it. Th=
is is where I think I hit the <BR>loony bin and just didnt see how I was go=
ing to fix this problem. <BR>Then it got worse and saw that my thoughts wer=
e now being <BR>communicated back to me. Then I knew it and
 was convinced =
I was going <BR>skitzo and that i was just truly arguing with myself in rea=
lity, <BR>especially when I saw I wasn't even speaking. I used the restroom=
, <BR>splash water on my face and faintly start to hear the same mob people=
 <BR>in my fan motor in the bathroom. I haven't drank, done any drugs <BR>(=
even prescription) and have a pretty complex job which I can still <BR>hand=
le, but yet I feel like I am going crazy. <BR><BR>I can't talk to anyone ab=
out it so I sit back at the CPU, only to <BR>hear that I need to open up th=
e front door. Screw that!=85I just look <BR>out the window and see nothing =
and say no way. They ask why not and <BR>that I should trust them and I say=
 hell no and I continue to <BR>hear "God Damnit" from them when they get ma=
d. They continue to ask <BR>me to open the door and I continue to check the=
 window to see <BR>nothing. I say to knock then and they get mad and say th=
ey have no <BR>hands. They don't sound like they are
 joking and get mad wh=
en I laugh <BR>even, so I continue to think I am just crazy at this point. =
I asked <BR>why they wanted to come in and they said they wanted to fix me.=
 I say <BR>there is nothing wrong with me and they say they hate me and wan=
t to <BR>eat me.<BR><BR>I start to really think about this and say ill open=
 the door if I get <BR>the answers to all this. They start saying things an=
d its if as <BR>though they see my thought process develop and say things l=
ike=85"watch <BR>him go". Then I hear out of my computer monitor something =
I couldnt <BR>even fathom. I hear my ex-wife's ex-best friends voice. His n=
ame was <BR>Daniel and he had committed suicide over 5 years ago. I did kno=
w him, <BR>but not as well as she had. It WAS his voice and he said "Charle=
s its <BR>Daniel" and then I heard their voice again say we are "down here =
with <BR>him". At this point I didnt know really what to think, but this pa=
rt <BR>in our conversation was the turning
 point on my beliefs and thought=
s <BR>on what was really going on. <BR><BR>I say nothing yet they somehow c=
an seem to hear my thoughts and start <BR>saying little things to make me t=
hink even more. It was the most <BR>fluent conversation I had ever had. It =
was truly telepathic and was <BR>on a level I could never really explain ev=
en to myself. Then it <BR>really hit me and I said "Demons". I tried to pla=
y something and got <BR>no response for the first time ever on the sound fi=
le. I then started <BR>piecing it all together from there and even though I=
 wasn't a <BR>believer this makes more sense then I could ever write down h=
ere and <BR>as a result I forever will be one now. <BR><BR>They ask for me =
to now open the door and I open the small glass door <BR>on my CPU desk and=
 they get really pissed off, saying I tricked them. <BR>Then their voice ch=
anged to the most demonic, vile and disturbing <BR>voice I could ever put i=
nto words. I never really thought of
 doing <BR>that until that moment and =
I think it was seen from them reaction, <BR>but it worked out quite nicely.=
 I start saying the our father prayer <BR>and I can hear the displeasure in=
 them even more and heard "that's it <BR>we are going in". I immediately to=
ok off my headphones and ran to get <BR>a bible they never did as far as I =
can tell, but I sat there all <BR>night with the bible in my hand praying. =
<BR><BR>I started calling people and my phone started cutting out, the bulb=
 <BR>on the porch blew and my good friend's girlfriend called me to ask me =
<BR>for help because my friend was drunk and passed out. It sounded like <B=
R>she was trying to flirt with me and I asked her how "A" nightclub was <BR=
>and she said good and then I said didn't you actually go to "B" <BR>nightc=
lub actually and she switches her story. I hang up and call <BR>back with n=
o answer. The time was only 1:10am and they never leave <BR>until the clubs=
 close so this was even odder.
 <BR><BR>I sat there terrified most of the n=
ight praying, until I called my <BR>brother who told me that I have to stan=
d up to them or I am feeding <BR>into their fear. He like my mom has been i=
nvolved in similar things <BR>like this but after talking to both of them, =
neither have on this <BR>level. But in a refreshing breath after talking to=
 them about this, <BR>they did seem to believe me. But it wasnt unil I rese=
arched this <BR>issue and found out about EVP and how it works, did I truly=
 know that <BR>I wasnt becoming a lunatic.<BR><BR>That brings me to today a=
nd me being at my wits end. I swear on <BR>everything this is all 100% true=
 and I feel like I am crazy even <BR>still. Even though I hear it from no o=
ne else and have a pretty good <BR>circle of friends, not to mention that I=
 still seem to do my job just <BR>fine as well. I havent put on my headphon=
es or heard any voices since <BR>I tried to last listen to the recording, w=
hich was now 3 days ago.
 <BR>Does anyone have any help and guidance here, =
as this all has really <BR>destroyed my life. I deleted all the copies of t=
he recording, except <BR>for one hardcopy. I still have the original record=
er with the file <BR>on, but I haven't tried to use the recording or record=
er any further, <BR>as I refuse to continue it without any guidance. I figu=
re its best to <BR>avoid them, like my brother said. Maybe someone can help=
 me <BR>understand all of this. Even if I have gotten rid of these things <=
BR>what does that say of B? I really spent a bunch of time making this <BR>=
really need some genuine help from someone in the know. I know it <BR>sound=
s crazy but please regard this all as true. I am new to this <BR>stuff and =
will just stay away from it now, but some kind of insight <BR>would be grea=
t.<BR><BR></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></div><br>
