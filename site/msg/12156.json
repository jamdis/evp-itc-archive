The common mistake is that  everyone turns \nit on and expects to get immediate results.  Well  all that comes out is random \nnames and what some people may term  &quot;garbage&quot; at that time.  You have to let \nthe spirits around  you learn how to communicate thru the box and this can \ntake a good 30  to 60 minutes.  At that time all the randomness will have died  \ndown and you can now start to communicate thru the Ovilus 1.  If  this step is \noverlooked then you just sit there staring at this unit  thinking you just \npissed away $200.00.  And that is not the  case.  It takes time for the spirits \nto learn how to communicate  regardless of what device is used.  Now if you \nuse this device in  the same location over and over again you only have to do it \n once.  When I first got mine it was spewing out all kind of  random garbage \nthat made sense.  But once I did this the  communication flowed fluently.  It \neven gave me the name of the  little girl who&#39;s spirit inhabits our house and \nwhen I called her name  after hearing it this little girl came and stood in \nthe hallway  looking at me in amazement.  The best was when my cat jumped up  by \nme and the Ovilus 1 and wanted attention the Ovilus 1 said &quot;good  cat&quot;.  Then \nwhen my dog ran into the room and wanted my attention  over the cat the unit \nsaid &quot;bad dog&quot;, LOL.  So it does work and  ask around to people who have them \nabout their experiences.\n \nJeff\n \n \nIn a message dated 9/16/2008 11:01:21 A.M.
