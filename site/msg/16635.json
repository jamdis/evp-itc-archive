A man with a &quot;country accent&quot; repeats &quot;Help me Jesus, help me je--&quot; and is interrupted by a mournful woman shouting out the name &quot;Amelia!&quot;\n\nDid I tap into some sort of &quot;lower realm&quot; or were these perhaps lost or confused souls calling out.  Something I didnt really expect.\n\nI have been trying to upload the file into my TOM&#39;S TUBE folder for a while this morning but it blinks out before it loads when I press the upload button---I think that this might just be a tempory connection glitch, so I will upload it later."}
