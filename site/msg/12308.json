It scans like all the others \nthough, i sold it on ebay after i hacked it.  It was more of a \nchallenge than anything for me, but i didn&#39;t need another radio.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ourobouros2k2&quot; &lt;ourobouros2k2@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; My wife is starting to look at me funny when I pull up \n&gt; radioshack.com &#39;cause she knows what&#39;s coming.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have seen where Steve reports that this mod is pretty difficult \n&gt; (getting to the mute wire) and, like him, I love a good challenge. \nI \n&gt; was wondering though, if anyone has used this modded radio \nregularly \n&gt; and can give opinions on it&#39;s performance stacked up against a 12-\n469 -\n&gt; 470 or 20-125. Looks like a more robust design, and that tuner knob \n&gt; looks like a great candidate for manual tuning as well. Any \nthoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Andy\n&gt;"}
