You asked several questions, so I'll take them one at a time:

1) you hope =
what? that i made a fool out of myself or that i called it in or perhaps bo=
th?=C2=A0 



I hope you called it in. Your resistance to giving the police=
 
information you said you thought you had on a child abductor, even after =

several prompts, makes me hope you did call it in, and didn't just say 
th=
at to stop me from prompting you. I don't know of course, I am not 
there. =
I have no desire that you make a fool of yourself, but if it 
helps save a =
child from am abductor, I think it would be worth it.

2) Why don't you get=
 on the box, and do some asking? 

As I have said in the past, my experienc=
e with those boxes has shown me nothing paranormal yet.=C2=A0 However, peop=
le continue to say there is more to it than my experience.=C2=A0 And so, I =
am keeping an open mind and trying to examine the evidence you provide.

3)=
 Why are negative people on these lists anyway. if you guys don't believe
 =
in this type of technology, why the heck are you all here? 

If I had absol=
ulely no belief that there might be something interesting going on with the=
 technology, I would not have been so insistent that you give your informat=
ion to the police.=C2=A0 How could a person, of good conscience, not prompt=
 you to give that information to the police?=C2=A0 Again how is that a nega=
tive thing to do?

Wouldn't the really negative thing be to ignore it?

When you label the files with what you heard, you influence the listener t=
