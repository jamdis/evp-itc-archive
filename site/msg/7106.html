&gt; Yep I can hear that Ann. Ive had that name come thru as well. Kinda  
&gt; strange coincidence as I was just sharing one of mine with someone  
&gt; new to this research as an example of people who come thru but I  
&gt; dont know them nor can confirm them other than what is said. On one  
&gt; they came thru saying something which I later compared to an old  
&gt; recording I was able to find online. They used same words he used  
&gt; to start his speech I was a little shocked when I heard it so I  
&gt; clipped it and made a side by side comparison.
&gt; Heres the file if ya havent heard it yet.
