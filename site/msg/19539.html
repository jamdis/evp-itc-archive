Hello....
I, too, have a Mod=
itronics UV/IR Full Spectrum HD Camcorder and a Moditronics Deep IR Still C=
amera (made by SVP). I agree that the camcorder is incorrectly named as it =
is not full spectrum. It is the UV and IR fields I am interested in anyway.=


Both are made from low quality, in my opinion, cameras. But whatever the =
technology this company uses in their units is very good, and I have yet to=
 see it duplicated. Their deep IR still camera will not pick up dust orbs, =
for example. When you get an orb on the still camera, chances are it is som=
ething...they are often self illuminating, solid or near solid white, often=
 have a tail. I have also gotten very, very few orbs using this camera as w=
ell.

I did buy this same SVP camera but modified by a different equipment =
supplier on the internet. It does show every dust orb there is, the picture=
 quality is a bit blurry or fuzzy many times. I was very disappointed.

One=
 thing about the SVP still camera is if you drop it, even once, you will ha=
ve a broken SD card slot. I was sold one on Ebay from someone who knew the =
SD card was broken and never revealed it. Some research showed me what the =
possible reason was...it cannot take a drop. So handle it with care. Their =
packing slip even says they will not warrant the camera against drops. But =
you probably won't find that advertised on their web site though.

I found =
it interesting and somewhat amusing that Ghost Hunters on tv showed up with=
 this equipment in their series. However the Moditronics label was ripped o=
ff, the glue was still on the camera and there was a zoom in to this portio=
n of one of the cameras.

In regards to the spectercams, in this economy an=
d with the infrequency that I investigate, I cannot justify spending what a=
ny of the spectercams go for. If I were going out to investigate every week=
 or every other week, then sure I could justify spending more money. But I =
would be nervous without having more reviews from users and especially thos=
e that have caught something on the Spectercam.

Hope this helps,
CB
