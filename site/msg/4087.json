I was walking in our local cemetery hold \nthe \n&gt; modified 12-470 near the gravesite of those I questioned.  I have \nnot \n&gt; posted any audio from the Mike&#39;s Box 12-470 system or the Spiricomp \n&gt; 12-469 system yet.  I plan to do one of my internet radio shows \nwhere \n&gt; I will debut some of the audio files from those systems.\n&gt; You can listen at http://www.ghosttoghostpm.com on the dates those \n&gt; will broadcast.  I have a 2 hour show on Tuesday&#39;s and Friday&#39;s. \nEach \n&gt; show gets between 400 and 1200 listeners, mostly from archive \n&gt; downloads after the LIVE show is over. Next Friday will be the \nfirst \n&gt; show where I debut the newer audio files.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mike, I have one more question for clarification.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I listened to the various voice recordings you captured and do I \n&gt; &gt; understand correctly that the little portable-enclosed system \n&gt; &gt; (pictured on your blog) captured the audio we&#39;ve heard from you \nto \n&gt; &gt; date?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LC Duplatt\n&gt; &gt; http://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi LC,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The two setups I did were:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Three 12-469&#39;s through a mixer, mixed with white noise \n&gt; &gt; (performed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with Audacity), my voice via a microphone, and all that audio \n&gt; &gt; &gt; captured using a free program called &quot;Scanner Recorder&quot;. You \ncan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; download it here: http://www.davee.com/scanrec/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have not really taken that unit anywhere to test it \nproperly.  \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; only did the original testing you hear on the video.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) One 12-470 placed in a &quot;chamber&quot;, with a noise generator \n(used \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;My Lil&#39; Reminder&quot; 20 second digital recorder/player) with \n&gt; &gt; recorded \n&gt; &gt; &gt; white/pink noise I captured while in Florida.  Also inside is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;Listen Up&quot; amplified microphone and an Olympus digital \n&gt; recorder.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The only wiring is a Y-connector which connects the output from \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; amplified mic to the input of the recorder, and also to ear-\nbuds \n&gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; listening to what is being recorded. You can also plug a small \n&gt; &gt; &gt; speaker into this if desired.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The raw audio from the linear sweep of either the AM or FM band \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; projected from the 12-470 speaker, into the closed &quot;chamber&quot;, \n&gt; along \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the audio from the speaker of the noise generator (&quot;My \nLil&#39; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reminder&quot;) unit.  Those two sources, plus any ambient noise \n&gt; inside \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;chamber&quot; is picked up by the amplified mic and fed into \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; recorder and ear-buds. The recorder produces the .wav file.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You can use a 12-469 instead of the 12-470. You just need to \n&gt; &gt; connect \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a small speker to the output of the 12-469.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As with my three 12-469 system, I have so far only done the \n&gt; initial \n&gt; &gt; &gt; test run on th 12-470 system.  I hope to bring both units to a \n&gt; &gt; place \n&gt; &gt; &gt; where I can do some better experimentation.  I have 2 weeks off \n&gt; &gt; near \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Christmas time, so that is probably when I&#39;ll be doing that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope I have answered your questions, LC.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mike,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today I modified my Radio Shack 12-469, but have some \n&gt; questions.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was easy to do, and I instantly plugged it into my Olympus \n&gt; voice \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recorder and recorded off of it easily.  Now I want to pipe \n&gt; some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; white noise in (and ambient), as well. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Is the set-up in your video what has worked best for you \n&gt; (with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computer and all)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Will you tell us what free computer programs you used (I \n&gt; think \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is Audacity)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) What microphone and white noise generator did you use for \n&gt; your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; travel pack unit pictured on UFOGeek.com (posted on December \n&gt; &gt; 8th)?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And can you give me a layout for the wiring of it - you know, \n&gt; how \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all hooks together?  I&#39;ll figure it out sooner or later, but \n&gt; I&#39;d \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rather it be sooner!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, LC\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am currently putting together another video, just like my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; others \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; showing a very practical way to use the Radio Shack Hack \n&gt; &gt; devices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You probably saw my 12-469 practical use videos, now I&#39;m \n&gt; going \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sharing a 12-470 practical use video.
