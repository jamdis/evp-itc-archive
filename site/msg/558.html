&gt; It&#x27;s good to see another like minded researcher. Groups are good 
for a few reasons.. you can meet other like minded people, you can 
bounce ideas off each other and get inspiration for new ideas, 
perhaps learn a few things and hear things from another perspective.
&gt;    
&gt;   Groups are comprised of individuals, and since everyone has 
thier own viewpoint unfortunately sometimes a conflict can arise. It 
is important to move past that and maintain some sort of harmony for 
our own sakes as well as the sake of the work we are doing. 
&gt;    
&gt;   I&#x27;d love to see some of your results, evp and imagery. I am 
always in the &quot;learning stage&quot; as far as any of this goes. I learn 
something new almost every day and its refreshing to talk to others 
with similar interests doing the same sort of work.
&gt;    
&gt;   My purpose for this work is to simply explore, learn, and 
improve my contact...on both sides of the veil.

&gt;             Thanks for the evp Misty! Will listen to them in a 
moment but just sending you this message to let you know that I got 
them here. I can only listen to a few EVP at a time because after 
that it seems like some of my own contacts butt in -- ever had that 
happen to you? I know that sounds inexplicable but I&#x27;m hoping this 
group will consider that even inexplicable things happen in groups 
that focus on the well...  inexplicable. :)
&gt;    
&gt;   I&#x27;ve been experimenting in EVP/ITC for awhile now. I don&#x27;t 
belong to any online forum/group other than this one at this present 
time but at least for now, I think I would like to give another shot 
at it -- gulp. I&#x27;m guessing there are a lot of people like me out 
there who have been really turned off by all of the shinanigan&#x27;s 
that go on in these online forums/groups but, I read your one post 
about how important it is that groups should strive for peace and 
harmony as much as humanly possible or else all suffers including 
even each members  contacts with these other &quot;worlds&quot;; or something 
to that effect...
&gt;   I&#x27;m a Survivalist, but I also believe that some of us are in 
contact with those dimensions occupied by beings of various kinds -- 
perhaps even extraterrestrial -- who knows? though it&#x27;s my hunch 
that most of these other beings are terrestrial yet unseen most of 
the time except in ITC and alternate states of consciousness -- AND, 
some of us are better at peering into the rabbit hole than others -- 
that&#x27;s a given. Too bad there are those who have a tough time 
accepting that.  
&gt;   I do EVP --  and also do ITC with my crappy little webcam. I&#x27;ve 
seen your images in your gallery and I&#x27;m very impressed by them. In 
fact, I think they are the best I&#x27;ve ever seen so far and it&#x27;s so 
refreshing to see that you seem to have no ego issues which is 
remarkable in itself. Lol, I must say, a rarity indeed!
&gt;    Perhaps this is one of the reasons why &quot;they&quot; are communicating 
to you so clearly as they are: of this I am certain. Keep up the 
good work! Your research in this field inspires all of us (though 
most will not admit it -- he,he) and even if we can&#x27;t get the same 
kind of results you do, I for one can say that it&#x27;s enough for me to 
see that there are others, such as yourself, who have whatever it 
takes to get the kind of images thats been granted to you, somehow, 
someway -- too bad there aren&#x27;t more like you in this field at this 
particular time but it could be that those who are, are not posting 
things online and for good reason -- jealousy and envy are very 
POWERFUL emotions and it&#x27;s best to stay as far away as possible from 
groups that are generating that. I can&#x27;t emphasize this more than 
that at this point in time but I know you already know that.

&gt;     Welcome to the group. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Sure I can repost for you. Deciding on which one to post...well 
thats the hard part LOL since I have had some newer ones that some 
may find easier to hear.
&gt;    
&gt;   Glad to hear you are interested in ITC. It is a fascinating 
subject. Perhaps you could tell me a little about what got you 
interested in it or any experiences you have had with it.
&gt;    
&gt;   I enjoy both the voice and image aspects of it. During the last 
year I have probably collected over 1000 sound bits and hundreds of 
images. I never ask anyone to believe me or any of my evidence, only 
that they look into it for themselves reguardless of what they think 
of my personal stuff.
&gt;    
&gt;   So everyone feel free to share and comment. Feedback is always 
good, it helps us and it helps &quot;them&quot; too. In the meantime I will 
repost a couple things for you including a few &quot;welcome&quot; 
introduction files from them to start/end our sessions. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Hope you can hear them. Enjoy!

&gt;   Hi Misty,
&gt; I just switched my acct over to receive email from this group in 
my 
&gt; email inbox. Sorry for the inconvenience, but could you re-post 
what 
&gt; you feel is the best evp from your most recent batch for me to 
hear? 
&gt; By the way, this is my first post here. Joined up a couple of 
weeks 
&gt; ago but didn&#x27;t have the time until now to post anything here. 
Found 
&gt; this group after doing a search for ITC groups... thanks :)


Hi Misty and thanks for your reply and sure, it&#x27;s easy enough to say 
that conflict can arise in group/forums like this but that&#x27;s not the 
whole story as to what I&#x27;ve been addressing here. Granted that what 
I&#x27;m really talking about is a very, very sensitive topic, I think 
Rolf-Dietmar Ehrhardt from the World ITC network put it best. 
Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t post the link to the page where he&#x27;s 
addressing this issue because of the frame-set layout of that site, 
so I&#x27;ve copy pasted that section where he&#x27;s specifically addressing 
this issue of the different kind of ITC researchers there are out 
there in a very eloquent and very, very gentle manner so as not to 
offend. Below is that section of that page where he&#x27;s talking about 
those different kinds of EVP/ITC researchers out there. It&#x27;s my 
belief, that you fall most definitely in the Systematic Experimenter 
category and no matter how much you will try to convince others 
otherwise, there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that this is where you are 
right now and most likely will remain in that category -- always. 


A model for TransCommunication (TC)
by Rolf-Dietmar Ehrhardt

After long-standing study of the phenomena in the EVP field and in 
ITC in general, I came to the conclusion that there must be 
principles behind the diverse results received by different 
experimenters. Much and perhaps everything that takes place probably 
has an explanation. Also in this field the basic principle is valid: 
you can not create something out of nothing. Nevertheless the 
question is: Are there common characteristics for these different 
results in TransCommunication? I believe it is the resonance between 
similar or identical thought structures or states of consciousness 
which makes a communication possible. Please bear with me during my 
attempt to set up a verifiable model.

Starting position of the experimenters:

After observing the experimenters in the fields of EVP and ITC, I 
believe it is reasonable to carry out a certain division into 
different personality types of experimenters. These types 
distinguish mainly through their experimentation behavior, which is 
also an expression of their attitudes concerning this phenomenon, 
and they distinguish also in the achieved results and the procedures 
used while experimenting. A typical experimenter might have 
qualities of two or three of these personality types in their own 
personality make-up.

Mourning Experimenter

This type represents an experimenter who does not permit himself 
other thoughts than those related to the deceased loved one caused 
by the strong emotional attachment to that person. This experimenter 
is strongly focused on his desire to get in contact with that loved 
one in spirit.
It makes a big difference whether it is love or fear. For example, a 
surviving wife might fear economic or emotional hardship as a result 
of her husband&#x27;s death, or she might fear her own death. If fear 
represents the main motive, unpleasant situations can occur. ( 
See &quot;How can I avoid unpleasant situations&quot;). Experimenters that 
undertake the contact experiment from love and attachment can expect 
pleasant results, although it may take time to achieve a contact.
This experimenter is mostly very tolerant opposite the results of 
others and knows that the result depend much on himself. Although he 
does not know how the contacts are accomplished he chooses the right 
way: he is focused because of his situation.
In the beginning these contacts are mostly of relatively good 
quality, but decrease more and more in quality, duration and 
frequency, unless this type of experimenter becomes a &quot;systematic 
experimenter&quot;.
  

Spontaneous or Impulsive Experimenter

This person wants to get many good voices, even fragments of 
sentences or words, regardless of the content. He is not interested 
in background information and doesn&#x27;t care how, why, why not 
different, which connection is there?
If an experimenter of this kind learns that another experimenter 
achieved good voices with a specific device or a device combination, 
he soon duplicates these devices, buying the necessary equipment to 
receive these same good voices. In case he has success with these 
devices only once, he modifies immediately again in order to better 
the results again. Every preserved signal and voice fragment is 
analyzed and interpreted, to find any connection with something. He 
speaks in this case also about &quot;science&quot;, &quot;scientific 
approach&quot;, &quot;critical point of view&quot; and so on.
That is the way people act who call other experimenters liars if 
they achieve good and even better results while approaching the 
whole matter from another point of view (for example, the spiritual 
way rather than the technical way).
  

Systematic Experimenter

This experimenter has studied the relations between spiritual 
conditions and results of the experiments. He has transferred his 
knowledge, earned through experience, into daily experimental work. 
If these experimenters should still have a surpassingly high 
mediality, highly amazing results are to be achieved then.
If this experimenter succeeds, holding his ego in check, he can set 
up remarkable results and (if the reader wants it) also findings for 
mankind.
This experimenter is exposed to extreme attacks since the achieved 
results are put down as fraud, delusion or mischief mostly by other 
ones.
Mostly it is envy which leads to these attacks. Because as soon as 
the voice critics receive the same or similar quality (even it is 
only a fragment), these are represented immediately as the ultimate 
results of a new experimentation technique and praised in the 
highest. The critics act this way although they drop back a short 
time later again onto the old result state. Because otherwise they 
would have come much further in quality, duration and frequency of 
voices. 

These different types of experimenters have existed from the very 
beginning of the EVP/ITC scene. A tolerance of the other 
experimenters and their results is practiced rarely. As a matter of 
fact there are also mixed types. Those individuals are possibly 
changing and evolving from one type to another.

The mourning experimenter is less interested in the quarrels and 
more interested in reassurance that there is life/existence after 
physical death.

The systematic experimenter with his mostly overriding results 
withdraws after sad experiences and gives insight into the results 
of his contacts to at best a small group of people.

The experimenter acting spontaneously is interested mostly in 
finding out who has voices recorded so that he can test also 
something new as quickly as possible.
