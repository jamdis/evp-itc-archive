It was a Ten-Tec RX-320\n&gt; receiver, and it received LW/MW/SW in AM/CW/SSB. It was a fun little radio,\n&gt; but using the software to control it, there were so many other options\n&gt; available. Nice bandscope with point-and-click tuning. Selectable user\n&gt; defined filters, you name it. Another neat feature was the fact there there\n&gt; were virtually dozens of third-party software releases for operating it,\n&gt; usually catering to the ham/swl crowd.\n&gt;\n&gt; My thoughts are that perhaps a similar computer-controlled ghost box could\n&gt; be made. You could use the software to define sweep style, and it would be\n&gt; endless possibilities. You could have an RNG controlling the random sweep,\n&gt; and linear sweeps could be programmed to emulate triangle, sawtooth, ramp,\n&gt; etc...\n&gt;\n&gt; In addition, you could have on-the-fly recording options, and you could\n&gt; apply various filters to clean it up. Visual waveform indicators, and file\n&gt; reverse option for reversing the file. Heck, you could even introduce your\n&gt; preference of noise source (white, pink, brown) into the signal. Perhaps an\n&gt; optional echo chamber with built in mic for output. All of these things\n&gt; could be software controlled, and I am not to sure they couldn&#39;t be\n&gt; implemented via software package for existing radios out there such as the\n&gt; ICOM PCR-1000 or the TEN-TEC Rx 320 or Pegasus. Really all of these things\n&gt; are a result of the software interface, so it is completely possible, but it\n&gt; would have to be someone with a lot more tech experience than me to make it\n&gt; a reality. Any takers?\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks\n&gt; Andy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------\n&gt; Dinner Made Easy Newsletter - Simple Meal Ideas for Your Family.
