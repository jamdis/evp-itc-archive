Good question. Last time I was using AM frequency was somewhere around 550-580 (not digital so cant tell ya exactly where it is/was). The night before it was between 850-1000 closer to the 900 mark. Not sure whats better. I would just try a few spots where nothings coming thru but the sound of the air waves or radio hum/buzz. Thats all I heard live anyway.\n\nI remember reading about other people getting contacts with an old tube radio and tuning to a section that it sounded like ocean waves... I didnt hear ocean waves but I guess the whooshing noise/static could be considered as such. It just wasnt a constant sound on mine as it was on theres. Just the hum of the radios power being on was the only contstant I noticed in both sessions. Perhaps why I hear nothing live but they all could?? No clue so I wont pretend to understand it anymore than the sweep files I get. They did voice having some difficulty on the lower freq.\n\nMisty\n\n--- On Sun, 8/31/08, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: For Misty  RE: [EVP-ITC] DRV - Direct Radio Voice recordings\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, August 31, 2008, 10:30 AM\n&gt; Hi Misty    Maybe I missed it but can u tell me what\n&gt; radio, am or fm, and radio frequency you tuned to more or\n&gt; less?  Probably the best stations I can get here are the\n&gt; non-stations.  lol  ron\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 8/30/08, Misty Dawn\n&gt; &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] DRV - Direct Radio Voice recordings\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, August 30, 2008, 8:29 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I never had alot of luck with it either. I tried it before\n&gt; with group many times but it was so distant and never clear\n&gt; or just nothing at all. But every now and then when I do a\n&gt; manual sweep I notice while I sit on dead air that sometimes\n&gt; thats where the best evp would come thru so I started to\n&gt; make it a habit that when I start and stop my sweep sessions\n&gt; its off station in the dead zone. I was doing a sweep the\n&gt; other night and they came thru real clear there with\n&gt; messages for my friend so I thought hmmm lets try just DRV\n&gt; and no sweeping and see if they can connect or if I can hear\n&gt; them. I heard nothing live just buzzing noise or what sounds\n&gt; like air/waves/whooshing now and then. So its not like some\n&gt; get where they hear it loud and clear and have conversations\n&gt; back and forth. At least not yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe a few adjustments could change that I dont know. I\n&gt; never know why some days they are clearer than others.\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 8/30/08, Kristin Morris &lt;ckmorris95@sbcgloba\n&gt; l.net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Kristin Morris &lt;ckmorris95@sbcgloba l.net&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] DRV - Direct Radio Voice\n&gt; recordings\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Saturday, August 30, 2008, 2:00 PM\n&gt; &gt; Misty - you have a wonderful connection with them.

I usually start and end my\n&gt; sweep\n&gt; &gt; sessions off station \n&gt; &gt; but they had been coming thru quite clear there so\n&gt; last\n&gt; &gt; night I did the \n&gt; &gt; entire session that way.
