<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Usually in my home since I don&#x27;t go on alot of inveastigations. I do take it on investigations when I go on any though. 

I did one session in my car because a coworker wanted to contact her friend who had committed suicide. I haven&#x27;t shared those files because she wants to keep it private, but we did get some good communication that night, and things were said that didn&#x27;t make sense to me, but meant something to her.

I try to do a session every other day, but have fallen behind a bit due to heavy holiday work load.
