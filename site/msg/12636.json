I just posted it to my newly created\nfolder titled &quot;John Frick&quot;. I have a definite thought on what it says\nbut I fully realize that our perception can be colored by what we\nexpect to hear (our perception can also be colored by whatever someone\nhas said they hear, so please try to listen to it before reading\nothers opinions on it). I would like to get as many people&#39;s\ninterpretations of what this might be saying as possible. If you have\nmore than one idea for what it is saying I&#39;d like to hear it. You can\npost here or email me at jfrick45@...\n\nI diminished the static before and after the voice/noise to reduce the\nirritation level of playing this multiple times. Any help with\nidentification would be appreciated.\n\nI&#39;ll update the file later with what words that seem most likely."}
