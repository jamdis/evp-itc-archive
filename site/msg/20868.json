This radio has a history of stopping mid scan.  I borrowed Steve&#39;s concept on the turbo hack and located where the buttons are soldered onto the pcb, and soldered a switch to them.  \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ParaSpinnProductions?feature=mhum#p/u/0/P2KcVZcBLuY\n\nThanks hopefully it works for you and the hundreds of other people that bought their &quot;Ghost Box 587&quot; from ebay and turn it on and it stops scanning."}
