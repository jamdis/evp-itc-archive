I have been \nmaking them for years using the Datak chemicals and get pretty good \nlooking boards. All I need are the patterns.

It&#39;s not so much evolution, it&#39;s using what I have, like the scrap\n&gt; piece of aluminum for the panel. The next &quot;evolution&quot; will be the printed\n&gt; circuit board. Of course I keep adding functions, which means more board\n&gt; real estate, which raises costs. I really want the linear sweep, and tone\n&gt; injection to be standard functions. It would be interesting to use all\n&gt; stereo speakers, and mics in the echo boxes, but that almost doubles the\n&gt; components again. I&#39;ve thought about a stripped down version, like just the\n&gt; tuner and sweep generator, then use something like a boom box for the all\n&gt; the audio and recording functions. If it was only linear sweep, the system\n&gt; could be made on a small board===cheap.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;"}
