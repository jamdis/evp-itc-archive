Well, its obvious that they are NOT  Scientists, although some may have a 
=
Scientific education, they likely function as mere "techs", applying known =

and accepted knowledge often to conventional and mundane tasks.  A REAL 
S=
cientist however, has a genuine interest in discovering something NEW 
(bes=
ides another decimal place) and does not let his childish emotions and 
pre=
conceptions get in the way of his investigations.

   Skeptics are primaril=
y those humans who are threatened or frightened of 
new knowledge.  Perhaps=
 they think new answers would reduce their status 
as "authorities" in thei=
r fields. or somehow "invalidate" their years of 
education.  They avoid th=
e "unknown" and "paranormal" on emotional 
grounds---Calling to mind the "g=
host stories" and "true" horror movies 
they heard and saw as little kids a=
nd using the axiom "There ain't no 
ghosts" as a psychological defense so t=
hat they would not have to face 
living in a world where such "terrible" th=
ings exist.

  Since they have already decided that the paranormal does not=
 exist,  it 
is not worth studying and gathering any detailed knowledge or =
facts about 
it.  Thus they remain blissfully and smugly IGNORANT of what t=
he subject 
matter is about.------Yet often  set themselves up as "Scientif=
ic 
authorities" who supposedly know what is real or what is not.    They 
=
often give themselves away and reveal their own ignorance in their 
stateme=
nts that look foolish to anyone who has read more than one book on 
the sub=
ject.

We true Scientists must realize that  such "skepticism" is a persona=
l 
"psychological defense" and should not be taken seriously by those to wh=
om 
it is directed at.  Arguing does no good.   A wise man once said "It is=
 
useless to reason a man out of a position he was never reasoned into in 
=
the first place".  SO we should ignore them and go on our merry way .
