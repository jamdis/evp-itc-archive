Thanks for the offer to help me.=C2=A0 But as you said, you are going throu=
gh very hard times in your life right now, and so as not to add any more st=
ress to your situation, we'll have to put that offer off for the indefinite=
 future.

I offer a suggestion on getting =

 making the suggestion.

I expect none of us like all =
the recent attacks, insults, accusations, threats, hurting of feelings, and=
 attempts to piss people off. 

Can I suggest we stick to the purpose of th=
e group: "the discussion, promotion, and developemnt of Electronic Voice Ph=
enomenon, and Instrumental Transcommunication methods and technologies as u=
sed in the communication with spirit, and other entities."

And that we go =
with Frank's philosophy "just take the approach, try different methods, see=
 what works."

No more threats. No name calling, insults, or accusations. J=
ust try to keep a positive group attitude, be open that not everyone believ=
es what everyone else does, and that's ok?
