So if the number of bytes match then they are the same bytes? See where my =
confusion comes in?

How does one do a bit-level comparison? Is there a pro=
gram that does that, or is there some way of comparison by looking at the f=
ile's properties?

        A file's content, it'=
s integrity, is simply the bytes (and their bits) in the file.  If the file=
's content integrity is changed, that is, by definition, changing the bytes=
.  If the bytes in there are not changed, then that integrity has not chang=
ed.

        It is possible to mess with other things about a file (like it=
s name, its suffix, or its ownership) but this does not effect the contents=
, and so would not affect that integrity, or the sound of the file (assumin=
g you could read it at all after changing the ownership, or the suffix, etc=
).

        When you do your tests, if you cannot do a bit level comparison=
, I would recommend at least checking the file sizes.  If they are identica=
l, there is a very high probability that the content has not changed.

          But I will test it from my side. I will sen=

          Either way, I am going to get to the bo=

                  Yes you can tell loss of quality by a bi=
t-level comparison.  An audio file is just a file of bytes, that is later i=
nterpreted by an audio player.  Two files with the exact same contents, whe=
ther they are audio or image or a dababase or an exe, are indistinguishable=
 from each other.  That is, if I copied the contents of one to a new file, =
and the contents of the other to a new file, and asked you which file each =
came from, there would be no way to tell.  Even the audio player could not =
tell.  The data is identical, and so the sound (or the picture, etc) would =
be identical.

                  Yes I did listen to the results, but that =
is not the best test (they sounded identical, but that is a subjective opin=
ion).  The real test is compring the contents.  Identical contents means in=
dentical data, means identical audio.

                  It is probably pos=
sible to set up an email compression scheme that does do lossy audio compre=
ssion.  My tests show my setup does not.  If you'd like me to help test you=

           For executables, you may be right. However, for wav files, the c=

                            The kind of compression that occurs during an e=
mail attachment is "lossless": it compress the file cleverly without losing=
 information.  For example, if I had a program in some .exe files, and I se=
nt it over email, it could compress it.  But if it lost even one bit, the r=
esulting exe file would not execute again after it was uncompressed on the =
other side.

                                This kind of compression does =
things like looking for common patterns in the file, and replacing them wit=
h a token.  A rough example would be if it found "Howdy Neighbor" in a file=
 20 times, it could replace all the occurances with say $HN1.  And also wri=

.

                                When the file gets to its destination it=
 can be uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are replaced with "Howdy N=
eighbor".  So it was compressed (instead of 14 characters each, it only nee=
ded 4, plus the dictionary), but lost no data.

                           =
     Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not lossless.  Depending on the l=
evel of compression, some level of data is lost, and so cannot be recovered=
 or reconstructed later.

   Pixelization doesn't clean-up the data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking =

ee colored blocks.

                                What's happening is tha=
t it is processing an area of the image, taking (for instance) the average =
value of that entire area, and replacing all the blocks in that area with t=
