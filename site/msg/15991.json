My first evp was my mothers voice and no boxes were involved. =\r\nThe box is a tool/method and there are many ways to get their voices heard.=\r\n So in the different methods I have used, yes I have heard voices that rese=\r\nmble their lifetime charachteristics and tones. Is it always that way? No. =\r\n\n                      &gt; \n                      &gt; Most often the group will=\r\n speak as one voice because I have requested they do so. One voice tone wil=\r\nl begin a sentence and another will end it. So I may hear my female friends=\r\n voice start off a thought and an unknown male voice finish the sentence. A=\r\nnd vice versa often they speak in tones which do not even come close to wha=\r\nt they sounded like in life. Quite often they are spirits I didnt know in l=\r\nife. I may get someone saying This is edison, and then find an old recordin=\r\ng he did where he starts it off saying This is edison, but for me I do not =\r\nknow the man so there is no recognition for me. I document it and file it a=\r\nway as a curiousity.\n                      &gt; \n                      &gt; I alw=\r\nays laugh when people say thats not your mother or friend thats something t=\r\nrying to fool you and mess with your head. I knew my mother longer than any=\r\none and its interesting that it is easier for those people to believe that =\r\nits possible that something/someone else is speaking pretending to be my mo=\r\nther but its much harder for them to believe that quite possibly that reall=\r\ny is my mother keeping her promise to stay in touch after death. If one is =\r\npossible then so is the other. I tend to be stubborn in some respects in th=\r\nat I dont instantly believe what anyone tells me whether living or not. If =\r\nthey give me a message I think is dumb I am very reluctant to pass it on an=\r\nd usually those are the ones that get the biggest confirmations tho it mean=\r\ns nothing to me at the time. So yes quite possibly evp work can be used the=\r\n same as mediumship in missing persons cases.\n                      &gt; \n    =\r\n                  &gt; For me tone of voice has grown to mean nothing. It is a=\r\n treat when they manage to come across sounding as they did when in physica=\r\nl form here but I look beyond the tone of voice. Often people get a childs =\r\nvoice and they become saddened by the thought that a child is earthbound. B=\r\nut I see it just as a representation of voice and whether it comes across a=\r\ns male female child or robot matters little to me.\n                      &gt; =\r\n\n                      &gt; I do find they often resume the &quot;character&quot; they p=\r\nlayed because after all that is sort of what we are, characters in some gia=\r\nnt play. Whether it is the beliefs they had which were their trademark, the=\r\n tone of voice, their image, or use of some nickname even I dont know about=\r\n I look at it all as just a pixel in a larger portrait that some part survi=\r\nves once the body has ceased to function.

My first evp was my \n  =\r\n                    mothers voice and no boxes were involved. The box is a =\r\n\n                      tool/method and there are many ways to get their voi=\r\nces \n                      heard. So in the different methods I have used, =\r\nyes I have \n                      heard voices that resemble their lifetime=\r\n charachteristics \n                      and tones. Is it always that way? =\r\nNo. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                      Most often the group will spea=\r\nk as one voice because I \n                      have requested they do so. =\r\nOne voice tone will begin a \n                      sentence and another wil=\r\nl end it. So I may hear my female \n                      friends voice star=\r\nt off a thought and an unknown male \n                      voice finish the=\r\n sentence. And vice versa often they speak \n                      in tones =\r\nwhich do not even come close to what they sounded \n                      li=\r\nke in life. Quite often they are spirits I didnt know in \n                 =\r\n     life. I may get someone saying This is edison, and then \n             =\r\n         find an old recording he did where he starts it off saying \n      =\r\n                This is edison, but for me I do not know the man so there \n=\r\n                      is no recognition for me. I document it and file it a=\r\nway \n                      as a curiousity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I always laugh=\r\n when \n                      people say thats not your mother or friend tha=\r\nts something \n                      trying to fool you and mess with your h=\r\nead. I knew my \n                      mother longer than anyone and its int=\r\neresting that it is \n                      easier for those people to belie=\r\nve that its possible that \n                      something/someone else is =\r\nspeaking pretending to be my \n                      mother but its much har=\r\nder for them to believe that quite \n                      possibly that rea=\r\nlly is my mother keeping her promise to \n                      stay in touc=\r\nh after death. If one is possible then so is \n                      the oth=\r\ner. I tend to be stubborn in some respects in that \n                      I=\r\n dont instantly believe what anyone tells me whether \n                     =\r\n living or not. If they give me a message I think is dumb I \n              =\r\n        am very reluctant to pass it on and usually those are the \n        =\r\n              ones that get the biggest confirmations tho it means \n       =\r\n               nothing to me at the time. So yes quite possibly evp work \n =\r\n                     can be used the same as mediumship in missing persons =\r\n\n                      cases.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; For me tone of voice has gro=\r\nwn to \n                      mean nothing. It is a treat when they manage t=\r\no come \n                      across sounding as they did when in physical =\r\nform here but \n                      I look beyond the tone of voice. Often=\r\n people get a childs \n                      voice and they become saddened =\r\nby the thought that a child \n                      is earthbound. But I see=\r\n it just as a representation of \n                      voice and whether it=\r\n comes across as male female child or \n                      robot matters =\r\nlittle to me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I do find \n                      they often =\r\nresume the &quot;character&quot; they played because \n                      after all=\r\n that is sort of what we are, characters in some \n                      gia=\r\nnt play. Whether it is the beliefs they had which were \n                   =\r\n   their trademark, the tone of voice, their image, or use of \n            =\r\n          some nickname even I dont know about I look at it all as \n       =\r\n               just a pixel in a larger portrait that some part survives \n =\r\n                     once the body has ceased to function.
