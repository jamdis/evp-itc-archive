<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Theory of evp


These are my thoughts on why we get class A or class B or lower, why 
some evps stand on their own and some have to be edited by an audio 
editing program to be heard. I am sure that all serious evp 
researchers do recording sessions in their homes more than anywhere 
else such as on a field investigation. If your like me you do a 
recording just about everyday. In my experience there are many 
different types of evp researchers you have your die hard white noise 
users, your silent no question no background noise individuals your 
only on investigations or in ascertain room of the house people and 
the radicals that reach out for new methods and ideas and are always 
experimenting with different ways to record evp and dedicating a lot 
of brain power to try and come up with a way to make the break 
through to real time communication as apposed to recording a question 
and answer session to be analyzed later.
Then you have the researchers like me that embrace with an open mind 
all forms of evp as well as itc and any other form of paranormal 
research and investigation, see I am the type of PI that will try new 
methods and post them to a forum or on my website so that others may 
see what I am working on and maybe give it a try themselves and 
hopefully further the method and the knowledge of it. Only to come 
under fire from the so called sceptics that believe they must at any 
cost negatively view any presented outcome to give themselves 
credibility. 
Anyway this is turning into a rant and getting away from the subject. 
Many evp researchers if not all that I see and read and have contact 
with are under the assumption that, and don&#x27;t get me wrong they may 
be 100% correct that all evp are formed the same way with the spirit 
using whatever form of ambient energy is available to form a message 
whether it be artificially supplied by the researcher or natural such 
as emf energy.
I do subscribe to this theory that spirits do need some sort of 
energy to form words and place them onto our recording medium, that 
is not my dispute.
I also believe that the majority of researchers believe an evp is an 
evp and the only valid evp is the one that can be heard loudly and 
clearly from the raw recording, I do not believe in this ideology. I 
believe there are two distinct and different ways we receive evp one 
from the physical plane and one from the spiritual plane. I believe 
that the only way to receive what has been classified as a class A 
evp is from an earthbound or grounded spirit that is actually 
haunting a location and is capable of utilizing the energy in the 
location much more efficiently for the reason that the spirit is 
among the investigator and can take advantage of the close proximity 
to the recording device and feed off of the physical and ambient 
energy supplied by the individual or individuals in the recording 
area. I also suspect that at times if we are lucky enough to be doing 
a recording at the right time we can record a class A evp from a 
spirit that is not grounded but in visitation at that time.
But the class A &amp; B++ evps must be obtained from a spirit that is 
occupying the same area as the recording device.
the second type of evp is the spiritual plane evp, messages recorded 
from spirits that have crossed over and are in the spiritual world, I 
believe they are still capable of sending evp messages from the 
spirit world only they must also use the ambient energy surrounding 
the recorder or compile it and place it onto the recorder. In other 
words a much harder and less effective method for the spirit leaving 
the message. Therefore the messages we receive in this manner are 
often weak quiet and a bit distorted but they are there.
If we take the time to look for them and clean them up most of them 
are understandable also the majority of these messages tend to be of 
a personal nature most likely from friends or loved ones that have 
crossed. The only thing that stops these messages from being 
discovered is that almost all the paranormal community subscribes to 
the idea that the only valid evp is the class A evp that does not 
need to be cleaned or enhanced in any way.
There are many evp researchers out there I&#x27;m sure that have started 
and adhered to the method of evp capture that they first learned 
about in a book or on the Internet and have not for lack of 
information or the opportunity to learn how to edit a recording using 
an audio editing program stuck to the strict set of recording 
techniques that are mostly explained on the net in one form or 
another. And I also believe that they witness the systematic 
slaughter of anyone who dares to post or mention any new or radical 
idea or form of evp capture so they shy away from taking the leap and 
trying some new or seldom recognized method and stick to the &quot;OLD&quot; 
and most widely accepted method out of fear of being ostracised 
amo9ng their paranormal peers and I do mean peers , No one in this 
field is any better than the next person there are only PI&#x27;s with 
more experience and ones with less but some with the more experience 
go through the motions of investigation with blinders on following an 
antiquated set of investigatory and research rules and not opening 
their minds to anything else.
My theory of the two different types of evp is formed from my 
personal experience with different methods of recording and capture 
and I have evps that are very personal in nature mentioning my name 
as well as subject matter unique to me and my family that would have 
been totally over looked if not for a good editing session.
NO one can make me believe especially the so called seasoned veterans 
that an evp that mentions my name and that of friends and or loved 
ones can be randomly put together from editing filters being used on 
raw static.
Well those are my thought on evp please do not hesitate to let me 
know what you think of this theory.
