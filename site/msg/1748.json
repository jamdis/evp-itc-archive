Knowing RoseMary Ellen personally, I can tell you that \nshe has devoted much of her life to the paranormal and through her \nwritings and teachings have been able to convey messages in many \nways and her intentions are sincere.\n\nI do have a theory on this, and is only my opinion.  \n\nI have watched and observed the box on many occassions.  I have \nworked on many evp&#39;s from the box, and for the most I understand \nmuch of what is coming through immediately. I have had one on one \nconversations many with the same voices and reconized them.  I see \nhow many people claim it doesn&#39;t work or they can not understand \nit.  Me however, truly believe that people whomn are &quot;pure&quot; with \ntheir intensions and their heart is in the right place with their \nresearch can fully understand and make a connect with the \notherside.  The otherside know&#39;s who they are and what they stand \nfor and build a respect for them to carry on their work.  \n\nI myself do not have a box at this moment, base on a respect issue \nfor Frank and his work.  See, I truly believe that when you are \nsuppose to acquire this tool of communication, the message will come \nthrough to let you know, and only then if your dedicated and \npassionate, should you be an advocate for the otherside.\n\n \nThese are just my thoughts.....\n\nJuli"}
