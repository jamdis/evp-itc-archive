Since only a\nlimited number of 1st printings have Chapter 8, &quot;The Realms Beyond&quot;,\nthen I suspect 1948 would be the date of the first printing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Each chapter ends with the year Mr. Edison wrote it (it is primarily\nhis diary). The part about spirit communication is dated 1922.\n&gt; \n&gt; Obviously a 61 year old book is a bit fragile so I&#39;ll start trying\nto scan those pages but I&#39;m not going to hurt the book for it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I suppose I just post them as JPGs in an email?

Very interesting. I went to Edison&#39;s place down\nhere in Florida in search of any information on the subject.\n&gt; I found nothing.

He simply hypothesizes on\nhow it could be done and the fact that the dead are just on a\ndifferent wavelength than the living.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, no links... This is from that old fashioned thing called a\nbook :))\n&gt; \n&gt; I can tell you how to find your own copy though if you wish.
