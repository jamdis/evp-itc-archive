<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You asked me a direct question, so I&#x27;ll answer.  I believe there IS a potential for danger in what we do.  I think a discussion of the risks would be frowned upon here because it would necessarily involve the &quot;religious&quot; aspect.  Therefore, if you want to communicate privately, I am open to that.

&gt; Hi Jim,
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I was going to stop but then some experienced members at another
&gt; group (RTSC) explained how I could protect myself from the negative
&gt; entities. Do you believe I&#x27;m putting myself &amp; family at risk? My
&gt; questions have been &quot;Hi, is anyone there?&quot; rather than asking for
&gt; direct information or seeking contact with a specific person.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Al
