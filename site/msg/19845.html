<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Dear Ursula,

Yes I did and I saw it.  This is new to me and I&#x27;m here to learn so I think I&#x27;ll just take it all in for a while and not butt in to what I don&#x27;t understand yet, sorry.

Thank you for making me go back and look again.

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m thinking there is faces embedded in sound, it&#x27;s related to speech, and
&gt; &gt; not just EVP. It seems to be a normal function of our own minds(living or
&gt; &gt; dead), the same as reverse speech. I found some faces in old EVPs from boxes
&gt; &gt; and also in music files. The ones from Evanescence are pretty impressive in
&gt; &gt; person, and do not seem to be intentionaly embedded.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I know, it&#x27;s not ghost hunters, and most don&#x27;t want to have to think.
&gt; &gt; I think most want this stuff in a neat little box, all well defined, all
&gt; &gt; rules and protocols known, but it just won&#x27;t stay in one box, or universe
&gt; &gt; for that matter.

&gt; Dear Frank,
&gt; 
&gt; I think that I see what you mean. I mean no offense, but I it would be helpful to see something a little more definitive that couldn&#x27;t be mistaken for matrixing. Is this possible? Is it just me?
