<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m with Stefan on this one, i&#x27;ll take robotic if i have the 
opportunity to get longer messages from them.  The point is 
advancement right?  Not how cool the voices sound, whether male or 
female.

&gt; Hi Steve &amp; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If we can get the allophone file with real human voices, than this
&gt; &gt; would be the next step i think.  
&gt; 
&gt; This probably wouldn&#x27;t work; the allophones must all have the same
&gt; pitch to fit together when concatenated.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; In a box recording you can get an assemblance of male or female, 
and
&gt; &gt; you can even get language accents. ie british, indian, spanish, 
etc...
&gt; &gt; With the allophone/soap, you have one electroinic voice.
&gt;    
&gt; Of course the robotic sound of the SpeechJet allophones is far from
&gt; being natural speech, but it seems to allow longer messages than 
other
&gt; raw audio with more variety of the sounds. So it seems we&#x27;ll have to
&gt; decide between information content and naturalness/individuality of 
the
&gt; voices.
