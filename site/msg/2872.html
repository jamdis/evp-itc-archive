RE: [EVP-ITC] More on You tube. 

What kind of camcorder do you have? Is there anyway to hook a mic up to it, or is that what you mean about not being able to put an audio input? I'll try hooking my speakers up instead of using my headset and see if I can hear it louder.
keep posting them! That is fascinating, I have never seen the boxes before!

That's as loud as I can get it without feedback. If I had a regular camcorder with an audio input it would come though better. I stil haven't gone to yiou tube to see the videos myself! Thanks for watching!!

I thought I heard it say Frank too. Frank is there anyway you can turn up the volume of the box? Maybe it's my headphones but it doesn't seem very loud on the videos? I love it, thanks so much for sharing :)

Hi all;

Okay, finally got a video converter to work, so up loaded longer videos to you tube. There should be three from today. I'm not usre if the largest one went through, it's only 6 minutes though. then another is aobut a minute, and the next about 20 seconds. I had to do multiples cuz the random mode wouldn't work for the first run. the purpose of the videos are to show the world waht the box is supposed to soudn like. I ask them to say my name, and they may have said Frank, but I could hear them say Princess a couple times.
