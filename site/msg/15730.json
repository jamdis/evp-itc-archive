I also went into this expecting to be lied to.  Don&#39;t know for sure if that&#39;s happened so far.\n\nI agree with you about the &quot;not completely conscious&quot; statement (in my humble opinion).  If what traditional paranormal literature tells us is true, the other side sounds very similar to the dream state -- and we all know what our dreams are like.  Let&#39;s just for a moment assume we are dealing with dead people:  if a person were to somehow get stuck in a bad state (something similar to the state where weird, frightening dreams are made), he might predict some frightening, strange stuff -- not out of maliciousness, but because he doesn&#39;t know better."}
