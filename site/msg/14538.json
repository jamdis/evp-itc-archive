Dr. Sam El-Khazen recently published an article in  the\nJournal of Neuroquantology (study of brain function at the  quantum\nmechanical level). In this paper entitled &quot;DNA The Gateway  to\nTime&quot;, El-Khazen talks about the relationship between the  structure\nof DNA, time, conscious perception and gravity. There is  credible\nevidence that these are intimately correlated. \n\nAn  important finding for this group has to do with how we may in\nfact detect  external influences in the physical world. If El-Khazen\nhas it right, two  EM waves must align in order for the preception\nprocess to even begin. If  this does not happen, there is nothing to\nperceive, even though we may be  impacted by an external potentially\ninfluencing EM wave. The second wave  is generated from borrowed\nenergy within our brain cells and is modelled  upon the structure of\nDNA strands. So yes we are impacted by billions of  EM signals per\nsecond but we actually detect only a small portion of  these that we\nlater process in the late-stage perceptual processes.  \n\nThis would nicely explain why two people would perceive  events\ndifferently despite the fact that they were literally side by  side\nwitnessing the same event. Again this is strictly a matter  of\nrandom probability, it seems to have nothing whatsoever to do  with\nvolition or intention. That is more the focus of the  later\nperceptual processing which is in turn dependent upon  this\nprobabilistic process.\n\nThis could also explain why it is that  EVP and ITC signals are\nperceived differently by different people even  when no physical\nalteration to the media has occurred and why different  things are\nheard more easily at different times by the same  person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**************Huge savings on HDTVs from Dell.com! \n(http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1221836042x1201399880/aol?redir=http:%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.ne\nt%2Fclk%3B215073686%3B37034322%3Bb)\n\r\n-------------------------------1242918236\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUS-ASCII&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18702&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; id=3Drole_body =\r\n\nbottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Dr=\r\nole_document \ncolor=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00=\r\n00a0&gt;April, could you hear the one with the 3 men talking \nabout a &quot;rat&quot; mo=\r\nuse&quot; 2 &quot;&nbsp;&quot; where is the super?&quot; pregnant mouse&quot; that came \nin loud and=\r\n clear for me.&nbsp; They &nbsp;kept me up all night, made me \nlaugh.&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In a message dated 5/21/2009 10:57:19 =\r\nA.M.
