I am still continueing my experiments with the Joe Satriani song "always with you always with me". Of course it still drowns out most of the voices when he gets into the high notes but the voices that do make it thru have a clarity about them that I liked. 
   
  So I was into my recording, just ran over a clip that had a male voice saying "this is linda sue" and I am focused on that because I know this name well, and then immediately afterwards it belts this out at a level that was so high it completely freaked me out. (heyimon.mp3)
   
  The name part was not as clear so I have clipped it for you straight to the good part.
   
  My only thoughts during the recording were "I wonder if some of the tones help them speak clearer" and then of course just enjoying the music as it played it is one of my favorite peices of music.
   
  So have a listen to the file that is attached to this posting and see if that doesnt blow your ears off =) (thats a hint to turn the volume down LOL) then if it catches your interest have a listen to the other files. There was more but it is too much to add to the posting as usual so I just picked a few I thought were easier for you guys to hear.
   
  They remarked "cant hear any one of us, who talks that loud". Then came the "this is all you got babe its good stuff" remark. They also commented on the crystal being an "ingrown technology xxx equipment" whatever that means. Like I said way too much stuff to add to one posting.
