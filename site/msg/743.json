Watched some of the first shuttle launches from \nthe back door of my apartment. [saw the first night launch off one of \nthe Cape&#39;s causeways] I was back there for a few days last year for \nbusiness (I used to work for Harris and I was a temporary liason for \nBoeing for a piece of equipment that Harris was building for the C-130 \nmodernization program).\n\nHave you ever investigated that allegedly haunted restaurant up in \nCocoa Beach that the late author Martin Caidin used to check out? I \ndon&#39;t remember the name right off the top of my head but his friend - \nparapsychologist Loyd Auerbach - wrote about it in one of his books. \nI&#39;ll look it up for you.\n\nPlease keep in touch as you might be able to assist me in verifying a \nmoderern day ghost story concerning the late Mercury astronaut Deke \nSlayton.\n\nGuy Jackson\nHuntington Beach, CA\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;benjamin tait&quot; &lt;paulbearer666200@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am so glad that Misty sent me this link.
