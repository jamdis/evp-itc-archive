Kay,
 
In my experience, our friends on the other side welcome new researc=
hers with open arms.
They tell me almost every session that it is vital for=
 the advancement of the communication to get the word out and 
bring in and=
 teach new researchers. The more positive and strong flow of energy the str=
onger the bridge becomes.
 
With each new researcher comes their individual=
 spiritual energy that is then incorporated into the collective energy of a=
ll involved, spirit
and physical alike.
 
So you can rest assured they are =
not apprehensive about communicating with you. But they may feel some of yo=
ur concern or apprehension 
about your ability to communicate with them.
 
=
It takes a little while for your hearing to become accustomed to the sound =
of a box and to be able to sift through the clutter to hear the spirit mess=
ages.
 For some it comes quicker than others. If you trust in yourself and =
believe you do have a place in this spirit communication.
Our friends on th=
e other side will do all they can to make sure you receive their messages.
=
 
I suggest you do short sessions consisting of simple questions that can b=
e answered in one or two words. this will help to train your ear 
to hear a=
nd understand the real time communication.
Do not get discouraged, our frie=
nds are there and they will guide you and we are always here to help. I hav=
e never heard of anyone 
walking away from box research because they did no=
t get any communication. give it time it will come.

Hi Bruce. Jus=
t a thought.... It's really sweet of you to make yourself so available to p=
eople, but if you have members take inquiries of this nature off the boards=
 by having them contact your privately, you are limiting the amount of lear=
ning that can take place. There are likely "lurkers" here, who will never j=
oin or come forward, but could really benefit from Lyn's questions and the =
answers she receives from the group. Taking communication privately also el=
iminates the possibility for her to receive multiple opinions. (not to impl=
y there isn't a time for privacy!) ;0)Like I said, just a thought. Margaret=
