  File        : /Radio Shack Box/steve--bruce--bruce--hey_babs.mp3 
  Uploaded by : urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@...&gt; 
  Description : &quot;Steve--Bruce--Bruce--Hey Babs&quot;---I wanted to do a test session tonight after i read your post Babs.  The end i believe says &quot;hey babs&quot;, but it was in a distance and i had to bring the volume up a bit.  They clearly repeated mine and bruce&#x27;s name.  I&#x27;m only 1 minute in to the recording, so i&#x27;ll post more if i get anything.  I hope this file helps clear up the fact that we are speaking with someone not of our realm.  I don&#x27;t need verification, but this file is for those who do.
