(You replied to my previo=\r\nus email and I forgot to thank you. )\n\nThe first EVP that I received was a =\r\nfellow saying &quot;Peace&quot;. Before I do an EVP session I always say a prayer and=\r\n use the quote used in Mark Macy&#39;s book which basically says that I would l=\r\nike to communicate with others who would like to see others move closer to =\r\nGod in thought, word, and deed. I always add that I would like to communica=\r\nte with those that come in Light, Love and Peace. He has said &quot;Peace&quot; twice=\r\n now. LOL.\n\nI have my sweet wife listen to all of them also. The second EVP=\r\n that I got was when I asked if there were any Spirits present. A woman, wh=\r\no sounded like she was in the living room said &quot;No, no Spirits.&quot; Then you c=\r\nould hear her walking on our hardwood floors with hard soled shoes. I figur=\r\ned maybe she didn&#39;t know she was a Spirit. \n\nThe laugh wasn&#39;t sinister. It =\r\njust caught me off of guard. I have a Jack Russell Terrier, Molly, and I wa=\r\ns playing with her, so it&#39;s possible that the young girl was giggling at Mo=\r\nlly or as you said maybe because she was on the tape. During this EVP Molly=\r\n was just a staring at the right of us. I am sure she saw them. \n\nThanks fo=\r\nr the input. I deeply appreciate it. \n\nMany Blessings All,\n\nJeremy \n\n\nFrom:=\r\n itcdeadpeople \nSent: Tuesday, April 08, 2008 7:34 PM\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com \nSubject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Question\n\n\nHi Jeremy.

It hasn&#39;t happened often, but I have heard \nlaughing on both my ow=\r\nn recordings, and that of others, but nothing there was nothing \nsinister s=\r\nounding.

If you think about it, it&#39;s very common for children to laugh an=\r\nd be silly \nwhile in the physical.

I just listened to the tape a few\n&gt; minutes ago and =\r\nwas astounded. I can hear a good friend of mine, Jean,\n&gt; that passed in 199=\r\n1, calling my name as clear as a bell. Then someone\n&gt; else, whispers my nam=\r\ne loudly into the tape recorder. After that you\n&gt; can hear a young girl gig=\r\ngle.
