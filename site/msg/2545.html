<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello Everyone... My name is April Slaughter and I am so happy to be 
a part of this group. Thank you for allowing me to join! 

Paranormal phenomena and I are no strangers to one another. It has 
always been an intrinsic part of my life as far back as I can 
remember, so what is considered to be out of the ordinary for most 
people is actually a pretty normal way of life for me. 

I&#x27;m an investigator with quite a bit of experience behind me in the 
field. Years ago, I was under the assumption that EVP happened around 
everyone, and could be easily captured by any individual attempting 
to collect it. But I have come to find that many people find it to be 
just as elusive as our crypto friend Bigfoot. For one reason or 
another, it has never been difficult for me to obtain it in most any 
situation or location. I will post examples of what I have collected 
over the years if you are interested in hearing them.

I have had the privilege of spending some time with 3 boxes, built by 
Frank... and I am always so intrigued by it. 

I look forward to getting to know you all!

~April</pre>
