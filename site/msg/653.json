I probably won&#39;t go, I need \nto spend too much for parts. I found this through the Ghost Village.\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Calling All Ghost Hunters and Ghost Lovers,\n&gt;\n&gt;The National Ghost Hunters Getaway is proud to present\n&gt;\n&gt;���The Shining��� Investigation\n&gt;\n&gt;January 27th & 28th 2007\n&gt;\n&gt;Join professional, amateur hunters and just plain ghost lovers as they \n&gt;investigate the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, CO. This magnificent Hotel was \n&gt;the inspiration to Stephen King���s ���The Shining��� and he himself spent time \n&gt;there developing his horrific nightmare, that we still enjoy today. Granted \n&gt;the spirits in his award winning book are more on the devilish side. The \n&gt;hotel does house some of the less life threatening spooks and has possibly \n&gt;done so shortly after its opening in 1909. This amazing structure offers \n&gt;the ghost hunters a late night investigation as we venture into it���s \n&gt;darkened halls and closed down facilities. The night may hold an eerie \n&gt;silent chill, but who���s to say some spirits are just dieing to speak to an \n&gt;unsuspecting ghost hunter. So spend the weekend learning what other ghost \n&gt;hunters do, collecting evidence, sharing your findings or just make new \n&gt;paranormal friends as we investigate the ghosts of Haunted Stanley Hotel.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Tickets for this event are $35 per person\n&gt;\n&gt;Rooms are $99 a night (double occupancy) for this special event\n&gt;So please remember to let them know you are with the Ghost Hunters Getaway\n&gt;\n&gt;You will be responsible for your our own travel and hotel arrangements.\n&gt;\n&gt;More details and event are being scheduled, so please feel free to contact \n&gt;AGHOST at\n&gt;\n&gt;Phone: 253 203-4383 or email Theresaghost@...\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFixing up the home?
