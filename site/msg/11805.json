Maybe this will help somewhat...\n1. Speakjet chip and suitable audio amp.\n2. PIC microcontroller, configured to talk to Speakjet serial port at \n9600 baud, including baud sync and flow control feedback from SJ.\n3. An array of &quot;speak&quot; (ascii)commands programmed into PIC to initiate \noutputting of all specific allophones, as per the Speakjet datasheet.\n4. External sensor of some form (perhaps EMF) that is able to act as \nenvironmental trigger for allophone speaking.\n5.PIC sub-routine to allow PIC to read and digitize the sensor analog \noutput via the PIC&#39;s A/D input(s).\n6 PIC sub-routine to link incoming sensor data to the selection of \nallophone output, depending on sensor level thresholds, etc and perhaps \na random selection process.\n\nThere is a Yahoo group dedicated to the Speakjet chip, but it wont be \nof much help in this case. The core work is in the PIC programming.\n\nThink thats about it for now. Hope this helps.\nregards from &quot;down under&quot;,\nJEFF\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chad&quot; &lt;cawiggins78@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone have plans for a speakerjet box they&#39;re willing to share?\n&gt;"}
