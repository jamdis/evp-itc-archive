Nathan to rule out your theory if  you possess a box (regardless what box you use), you have the ability to control the environment in which you conduct your sessions, and ask specific questions at all times of the day and night and eliminate these issues.  
   
  There are so many different forms of of two way communication now, that I think the real key ingredient is your belief.  
   
  Just my thoughts!

This whole radio and spirit voices, could be a MASSIVE

Think about it.

THAT IS WHY I USE EVPmaker only to commuincate with
