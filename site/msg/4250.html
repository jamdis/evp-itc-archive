During a session with the RS 470 my technition mike told me that our 
fellow researcher Jeff&#x27;s uncle was going to die from suffering a stroke.

I informed jeff of the message and sent him the file. He wrote back 
asking If I could confirm this and get his uncles name.

I did another quick session with the RS 470 and recieved the name mark 
from my guide lisa just once and then mike and lisa both shouted BOB,BOB
die. 

I notified Jeff of this and he confirmed he had both an uncle Mark And 
an uncle Bob, after inquiring about the condition of his uncle Bob he 
was informed that his uncle Bob was hospitalised and graveley ill.

He has not as of now suffered a stroke thank god, but jeff seems to 
think his prognoses is not good.

I ask that we all say a prayer for Uncle Bob.

I posted this and the accompanying file for pure research sake.

Jeff has said he will keep me posted and I will appropriately keep the 
group informed.
