In my short time I have gathered enough &quot;proof&quot; for myself that this method works for ME. And from what I have seen from others that I have let &quot;listen&quot; to my files (friends) I am blessed with the &quot;ability&quot; to HEAR very low audio artifacts....so this will help me in my RESEARCH. And I am OPEN to any help to reach my goals (or help others) with their goals. Have fun people. On a HAPPIER NOTE :) I was lucky enough to catch the RR-DR60 taking a nap yesterday....it missed a few evp&#39;s real close together (in a 5 second clip) the Sony ICD-B7 heard a male use a different number than what I used. I said 16 (my earlier age I was saying in recorder) and the male evp said 13....then a female laughs. All this was missed by the DR60 (except my 16 was recorded in both recorders) BUT then the DR60 &quot;caught&quot; the B7 &quot;napping&quot; at near the end of the 5 second clip....the DR60 heard &quot;let me out&quot; in a clear (quite) males voice. So this is very promising piece of evidence for me. **those 2 recordings have been uploaded to my folder. I will include an Olympus W-10 (soon as arrives), Panasonic RR-US360 (when I think to grab it) and my RR-QR80 to go with my RR-QR100, and one more (can&#39;t remember what brand-model of this last---due to arrive) LOL. I need to build a multiple mounting devise to aid in putting these into tandem service. Then I think I will use my Olympus DS-50 as my &quot;Control&quot; recorder....by using it on the HQ settings. I am looking to build a &quot;subsonic&quot; microphone also (something to do with those low &quot;booms&quot; that I have noticed lead or follow many evp&#39;s). So I look forward to any ideas. Falure is NOT an option. Haha....."}
