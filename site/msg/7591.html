&gt; Ron, You have to keep trying!   I know it gets frustrating, but 
that is what keeps up going!  You will get past the week signal and 
when you get that 1 awesome session (above all the rest) it will be 
well worth it.  
&gt;    
&gt;    
&gt;   I thought the very same thing when I started.  I couldn&#x27;t get 
enough of the voices, and keep wanting more and more, only not to be 
able to get the stations and scanning I needed.  I ended up 
researching for signal strenght, asking Frank and the others for 
help, and hear I am now.  
&gt;    
&gt;   Its the hurdles we climb, but once we make it to the 
top......WHOOO what sweet success!

&gt;           Just found this about your new box.  Looks and sounds 
promising.  But I suppose in my Land-of-Weak-Signals I would get 
nothing.  On the other hand, I almost feel I would sacrafice a volume 
of sessions and signals for good, clear, multi-word messages.  I am 
getting EVP block because I am afraid I will get nothing during a 
session or, worse yet, I may be getting messages but I cannot hear or 
understand them...if you get my drift.  Good stuff at your end.  Ron L

&gt; I am testing that scans to strong signals only on the FM band, with 
&gt; scan rate and range adjustments. This method is different sounding, 
&gt; being somewhat choppy, but may yield clearer audio. The downside, 
as I 
&gt; have been discussing elsewhere, may be the lack of weaker signals 
&gt; between, and less white noise to be utilized. I&#x27;ll keep working 
with 
&gt; it and post my results as I have them. If spirits can manipulate 
&gt; audio, then this method may have merit, too. ;)
