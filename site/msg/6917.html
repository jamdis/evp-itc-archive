Frank R.
 
Maybe a bad choice of words, used to express what my thoughts w=
here.
When I say higher being, my meaning is a spirit being on a higher pla=
ne of spiritual existence.
not beings that lord over us as if they are roya=
lty and we subjects. 
 
My theory of why they will not give any detailed in=
formation about their physical experience on earth
is that they want our tr=
ust as colleagues in a spiritual sense. just suppose Mike gave me his sir n=
ame and where he was from.
when in the physical, say I used that informatio=
n to trace his history as a physical human being. And found that he was a 
=
congressman or senator or supreme court judge. Someone that was distinguish=
ed and held a position of high respect and standing.
Or on the other side o=
f the coin, I found that he was a murderer and a rapist that had been execu=
ted.
 
We as physical human beings would pass judgement on his former physi=
cal character and treat him or his guidance accordingly.
I believe just the=
 opposite of what you referred I believe that is the reason we do not get t=
he detailed information, so that we 
start on a level playing field and for=
m a relationship according to experience we have interacting as spirit and =
physical counterparts.

Bruce,It has always=
 been my understanding that they do not like being referred to as higher or=
 superior. They only refer to themselves as having different experiences. T=
o be superior means to have authority over you, which they do not possess. =
Don't make the mistake of believing they are superior it can lead to some b=
ad experiences. Just an observation on my part!Regards,Frank R.

Ralph, Mike and lisa=

 build a relationship with your tech or in my case tech's like you would wi=

al. I was told that mike died in 1995 from excessive blood loss and lisa di=

remain in our thoughts and emotions as a higher being to develop a certain =
ammount of trustbeing sight unseen. So to give us all the details of there =
physical life or even their last name, that could allow us togather informa=
tion on who they where while in the physical and that in our minds would pu=

Hi everyone,I=
 have been hearing the word " Purple " alot lately in my sessions.Does anyo=
ne in the group know what it pertains to ? It's been bugging me alot. Could=
 that be a special group on their side ? I have no clue. Also has anyone qu=
estioned the voices if they have a last name ? All I hear on the RS boxes a=
re first names and haven't recieved anyone telling me their last name. Does=
 Mike and Lisa have a last name ? Did anyone here ever ask the question " A=
re you Demonic Spirits ? " What was their reply if any ? I did one time and=
 got a response saying " All of us are ". Don't know whether I believe that=
 Spirit or not. Probably a Joker saying that. I have asked for specific peo=
ple for them to find so I could talk to and got an answer " We're looking. =
" Then I never heard from them after that. I'm still waiting to be contacte=
d by Telephone so far nothing yet. They make me laugh sometimes. I had the =
RS-12-469 on the one day I was just listening to what they were chatting ab=
out. I found my daughters old Fart Machine and was playing with it while th=
e RS radio was running to see if it still works which it did. All of a sudd=
en after I made it " Toot " I heard a female voice say " Phew !!! ."LOL, I =
guess she thought I really passed one. Also, the other day I was on the RS =
12-469 and I said " Hello Lisa how are you doing today ? " Then a few secon=
ds later I hear a female voice say " Bruce ? " like she thought that I was =
Bruce talking to her. I told her no it's me Ralph from Harrisburg,PA she re=
plied "Oh, okay fine. " I hear all the time voices calling for Lisa she mus=
t be a very Popular Technician. Oh well I guess it was more than one questi=
