Looks and sounds promising.  But I suppose in my Land-of-Weak-Signals I would get nothing.  On the other hand, I almost feel I would sacrafice a volume of sessions and signals for good, clear, multi-word messages.  I am getting EVP block because I am afraid I will get nothing during a session or, worse yet, I may be getting messages but I cannot hear or understand them...if you get my drift.  Good stuff at your end.  Ron L\n\nLC Duplatt &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:          I had posted this elsewhere, but thought I should post it here for \ngroup fodder.
