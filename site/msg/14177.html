This is why with digital photos, you can't enlarge them =
without loosing resolution. You can go smaller, but not larger.
=A0
When yo=
u enlarge a digital photo, the photo gets stretched, but the same amount of=
 pixels have to now fill in, so they get larger, which magnifies the pixela=
tion. You end up with a blocky "lo-res" image.=A0You can choose to have it =
"resample", but then you get what RJ described, where the program looks at =
the existing pixels and add pixels that are an average of the surrounding p=
ixels. So you still end up what a grainy, digital looking picture.
=A0
When=
 saving=A0a photo=A0to a compressed format, such as jpeg, you actually loos=
e data, or pixels. The program decides which data to drop to make the file =
smaller. Each time you open and resave, you loose more data.The resolution =
gets worse and worse.
=A0
This is the same thing that happens with audio fi=
les, you loose data each time you save it to a compressed format.

Pixelization doesn't clean-up the data: it replaces it.=A0 Imagine taki=
ng a picture of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixeliza=
tion to the picture.=A0 Soon, you would not be able to tell there were flow=
ers there at all.=A0 You would see a lot of colored blocks.

Or in the othe=

zing this, after a while, you would again start to see colored blocks.

Wha=
t's happening is that it is processing an area of the image, taking (for in=
stance) the average value of that entire area, and replacing all the blocks=
 in that area with the average.=A0 In video processing, this would result i=

couldn't tell whether your pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a=

It works the sam=

Be a bit careful of formats like m=
p3 if you are doing a detailed analysis of the sounds though.=A0=A0 While s=
ome formats (like wav) can store the audio very close to the way it was rec=
orded, formats like mp3 compress the file, and in so doing lose some of the=
 sonic details.=A0 This may not be a big deal in music, where the audio is =
fairly clear to begin with.=A0 But with sound sources with a lot of noise (=
like evps), this can not only obscure any real sounds, but pixelize non-sou=
nds (like white noise) and make them start to sound like speech.

So mp3 mi=
ght be good for sharing the data, once you've already formed an opinion bas=
ed on an analysis of the wav file.=A0 But mp3 is not good as a medium for a=
nalysis.=A0 It can lead to many false positives and misinterpretations.
