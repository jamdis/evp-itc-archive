I never wanted to be scared. That was never my intention =
when I joined a ghosthunting group. I just wanted to make contact with some=
thing other than physical human. And I definitely got to, even felt what wa=

 That's why I find it frustrating that most insist on running aorund in the=
 dark to get evidence and EVP when they could stay home and get much more. =
Spirits and entities travel, even the ones that are supposedly stuck will c=
