I have had two\nFrank&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; boxes #&#39;s 12 and 29. #12 was  stolen from me by a low life that took\n&gt; &gt; advantage of my  generosity. That is another story.\n&gt; &gt; I still have Frank&#39;s box #29,  the reason you never hear files from\nme\n&gt; using\n&gt; &gt; that box  is because it literally &quot;Sucks!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Most if not all  Frank&#39;s boxes are inherently filled with static\nwhite\n&gt; noise\n&gt;  &gt; and that combined with a metal echo box and noise generator make  it\nvery\n&gt; &gt; difficult to hear anything let alone communication  which is\ndifficult\n&gt; enough\n&gt; &gt; to hear from a quiet box  like the 125.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank&#39;s box has seen it&#39;s day and  served it&#39;s purpose in my opinion\nit is\n&gt; &gt; antiquated and is no  where near the quality of even a small cheap\nRS\n&gt; 12-469\n&gt; &gt;  as far as clarity of communication.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank is  actually using the guts from RS hacks to build his boxes\nnow so\n&gt;  why\n&gt; &gt; have a &quot;FRANKENBOX&quot; that is essentially an RS hack with noise  added\n&gt; instead\n&gt; &gt; of just buying an RS box and getting better  communication?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mind you this is only my opinion but  it is based on years of\nexperience\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; every box that  is or has been used. I currently have 14 different\nboxes\n&gt;  not\n&gt; &gt; to mention EVP maker and I have done extensive sessions  and\nresearch with\n&gt; &gt; each and for my money you can give me a  20-125 every time, the\nFrank&#39;s\n&gt; box\n&gt; &gt; should be retired  to the box museum where it belongs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am the only  person in this research that will come out and speak\nthe\n&gt;  truth\n&gt; &gt; about the Frank&#39;s box, there are many people now that have  them and\nthe\n&gt; only\n&gt; &gt; person you will ever hear a file  from is Steve Hultay and sometimes\nFrank\n&gt; &gt; himself, and Frank&#39;s  files are so rough you may hear 1 out of a\nhundred\n&gt; &gt; files the  way he does due to the fact that he does not even take\nthe\n&gt; time  to\n&gt; &gt; do a proper session he just turns the box on and records a  couple\nof\n&gt; minute\n&gt; &gt; using his CELL PHONE !\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank has his place in RTSC history due to his ALLEGED  invention\noff the\n&gt; &gt; first ghost box and he deserves the respect  for his &quot;POSSIBLE&quot;\n&gt; &gt; accomplishment but to be revered as a god in  the box field NO not\nby me\n&gt; &gt; anyway.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I  use the words &quot;ALLEGED&quot; and &quot;POSSIBLE&quot; in terms of his being  the\nfirst\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; create the ghost box due to some recent  information that has been\n&gt; brought to\n&gt; &gt; my attention that  concerns an individual that created, built and\nused A\n&gt; &gt; Radio  Sweeping Ghost Box in 1969.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am gathering  information and documentation now and will hopefully\nbe\n&gt;  able\n&gt; &gt; to dispel the myth of Frank sumption being the father of the  ghost\nBox\n&gt; soon.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is to be  continued!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All is  possible, nothing is probable\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------ ---- ----\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ************ ************&lt;WBR&gt;**An  Excellent Credit Score is 750.

I have had tw=\r\no&lt;BR&gt;Frank&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; boxes #&#39;s 12 and 29. #12 was \n  stolen from me by=\r\n a low life that took&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; advantage of my \n  generosity. That is a=\r\nnother story.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I still have Frank&#39;s box #29, \n  the reason you =\r\nnever hear files from&lt;BR&gt;me&lt;BR&gt;&gt; using&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that box \n  is becau=\r\nse it literally &quot;Sucks!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Most if not all \n  Frank=\r\n&#39;s boxes are inherently filled with static&lt;BR&gt;white&lt;BR&gt;&gt; noise&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n=\r\n  &gt; and that combined with a metal echo box and noise generator make \n  =\r\nit&lt;BR&gt;very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; difficult to hear anything let alone communication =\r\n\n  which is&lt;BR&gt;difficult&lt;BR&gt;&gt; enough&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to hear from a quiet b=\r\nox \n  like the 125.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Frank&#39;s box has seen it&#39;s day=\r\n and \n  served it&#39;s purpose in my opinion&lt;BR&gt;it is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; antiquated =\r\nand is no \n  where near the quality of even a small cheap&lt;BR&gt;RS&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 12-=\r\n469&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  as far as clarity of communication.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Frank is \n  actually using the guts from RS hacks to build his boxes=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;now so&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  why&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; have a &quot;FRANKENBOX&quot; that is essentia=\r\nlly an RS hack with noise \n  added&lt;BR&gt;&gt; instead&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of just buy=\r\ning an RS box and getting better \n  communication?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Mind you this is only my opinion but \n  it is based on years of&lt;BR&gt;experi=\r\nence&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; every box that \n  is or has been used. I cur=\r\nrently have 14 different&lt;BR&gt;boxes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to mention EV=\r\nP maker and I have done extensive sessions \n  and&lt;BR&gt;research with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; each and for my money you can give me a \n  20-125 every time, the&lt;BR&gt;F=\r\nrank&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; box&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; should be retired \n  to the box museum wher=\r\ne it belongs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I am the only \n  person in this res=\r\nearch that will come out and speak&lt;BR&gt;the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  truth&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; abo=\r\nut the Frank&#39;s box, there are many people now that have \n  them and&lt;BR&gt;the&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; only&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; person you will ever hear a file \n  from is Steve=\r\n Hultay and sometimes&lt;BR&gt;Frank&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; himself, and Frank&#39;s \n  files a=\r\nre so rough you may hear 1 out of a&lt;BR&gt;hundred&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; files the \n  wa=\r\ny he does due to the fact that he does not even take&lt;BR&gt;the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; time \n =\r\n to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; do a proper session he just turns the box on and records a=\r\n \n  couple&lt;BR&gt;of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; minute&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; using his CELL PHONE !&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n  &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Frank has his place in RTSC history due to his ALLEGE=\r\nD \n  invention&lt;BR&gt;off the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; first ghost box and he deserves the =\r\nrespect \n  for his &quot;POSSIBLE&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; accomplishment but to be revered=\r\n as a god in \n  the box field NO not&lt;BR&gt;by me&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; anyway.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I \n  use the words &quot;ALLEGED&quot; and &quot;POSSIBLE&quot; in terms of h=\r\nis being \n  the&lt;BR&gt;first&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; create the ghost box due t=\r\no some recent \n  information that has been&lt;BR&gt;&gt; brought to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nmy attention that \n  concerns an individual that created, built and&lt;BR&gt;used=\r\n A&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Radio \n  Sweeping Ghost Box in 1969.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; I am gathering \n  information and documentation now and will hopefully&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  able&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to dispel the myth of Frank sumption bei=\r\nng the father of the \n  ghost&lt;BR&gt;Box&lt;BR&gt;&gt; soon.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; That is to be \n  continued!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; All is \n  possible, nothing is probable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Br=\r\nuce&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ ---- ----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ************&lt;WBR&gt;**An \n  Excel=\r\nlent Credit Score is 750.
