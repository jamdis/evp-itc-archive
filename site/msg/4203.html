<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I just created a folder (LC&#x27;s RS 12-469 Recordings) to dump my 12-469 
experimental recordings into.  There is one recording in the folder 
that to me says, &quot;Just work on it!&quot;  Background: I was constructing 
the echo chamber and experimenting with the amped speakers running 
out of the earphone jack with an amped mic from my audio recorder, 
all together in a closed plastic project box. That&#x27;s when I was 
recording the interior sounds and heard &quot;Just work on it!&quot; in a male 
voice upon playback of the audio.  I was frustrated at the time, so 
the message is spot on...what do you guys think?  

BTW, I left the 12-469 and audio recorder outside the box and have 
since tore apart the &quot;My Lil Recorder&quot; so I could run its speaker 
inside the box, but still control it from the outside. What is 
interesting is when I close the box and play just the white noise, it 
sounds like people talking in the box, but when I record it, it 
sounds like a siren! If I take the lid off, it does not sound like 
people talking, nor does it sound like a siren. Not sure what&#x27;s going 
on, yet, but it does indicate that sound waves bouncing around in the 
chamber definitely sound much different than straight from the Radio 
Shack radio.

&gt; Hi Rita,
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome to the group.  Yes, Bruce is correct... my sound chamber 
design is an experiment to see how well that design works.  I took 
the basic components of a typical ghost box system and placed them 
into the plastic enclosure. But to hear what is desired does not 
always require a chamber. The chamber is just a place where the three 
sound components can mix and be captured by the microphone.
&gt; Just one of many different methods that can be used.
&gt; 
&gt; I have even got good results by just using a 12-470 and a recorder 
in the open air.
&gt; 
&gt; I did build a couple of new chamber systems and will probably build 
one more for a total of 4.  And I&#x27;ll probably provide some of those 
to some locals here to test. I&#x27;d like to get others input on this 
experimental design. LC is also putting one together using the 12-
469. So we will have data from that area too.
&gt; 
&gt; Again... welcome to the group.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hi Rita,
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; And welcome to the group I am always pleased to see new members 
and new interest in our research.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; You do not need anything extra to use the 12-469 you can use it 
with just the ear buds that are supplied with the radio.
&gt; &gt; If you like you can purchase an inexspensive fold up speaker from 
radio shack. It is 19.99 and works quite well.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; go to this page for a pic and description of the speaker

&gt; &gt; The sound chamber that mike colleta has been developing is an 
experiment he is doing and is in no way necessary to
&gt; &gt; obtain good spirit communication with the RS box.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Rita, I think you will have to get a pair of amplified speakers 
on that 469, and put them in a sound chamber of some sort. In that 
chamber, you will want probably an amplified microphone running into 
your voice recorder, to pick up the sounds bouncing around in there. 
You can also add some white noise into the box, but I think people 
are getting results without adding the additional noise. The chamber 
seems to really bounce the sound around and give you a good mix to 
record.LC--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rita&quot; &lt;nvrenuf1031@&gt; 
wrote:&gt;&gt; Hi Everyone,&gt; &gt; New to group here. We just completed the 
advance hack on our 469 &gt; model. Are you supposed to hear the voices 
from the radio stations or &gt; just white noise?&gt; &gt; Also, is it best to 
hook up an external speaker, one or two, in order &gt; to record to a 
digital recorder? What is the best way to record, using &gt; digital 
recorder, or direct into PC using Sound recorder, and using a &gt; line 
in/line out connection?&gt; &gt; What is the recommended length of 
sessions. Should I try just a minute &gt; or two, or longer at one 
sitting?&gt; &gt; Thanks to all!&gt; Rita&gt;
