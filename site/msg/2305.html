Frank,
 
Let me try to pt it another way, suppose I had a cell phone and my=
 
cell number had not changed since I had gotten the phone. All my
friends =
and family would know that was my cell phone #, Then I 
bought a new cell p=
hone and gave my old cell phone to oh say my younger sister
 
and she had k=
ept the same number that was on the phone because I kept the bill under my =
name
know when anyone dialed that number they would expect me to pick it up=
 but now my sister would
be answering that particular phone and I would hav=
e a new phone number. Eventually everyone 
would get used to my sister havi=
ng the old number and me having a new one and everything would
be fine.
 
I=
 can't think of a better way to say what I'm thinking.
 
p.s. none of the b=
oxes are shitty and anyone that was privileged to get a box I'm sure agrees=
 with me.

Well, Rosemary claims it's because of the "imprinting" of energy o=
n the box.  I guess just use will re-imprint it.   I have concerns about th=
e older boxes that I now consider junk. I feel sorry for the ones that have=
 those, and are forced to use it because nothing else is available. There's=
 no nice way to say it, the old boxes are just shitty! I wish I could repla=
ce those, but it's not like I have factory and can just whip out some new b=
oxes.    Frank

Frank R, That is another possibl=
e theory, It is going to take a lot of experimentation to find the true ans=
wers.And we may never do that. The incident that led me to that hypothesis =
was the first and second sessions with the box they continually asked for f=
rank and purple even after I stated my name as the user of the box and it's=
 new location. Steve also had a similar occurrence with box thirteen asking=
 about Colorado and purple when he first received his box. I will try to ge=
t some answers on the subject from our friends on the other side until then=
 your guess is as good as mine. Bruce

Bruce,It has nothing to do with the box. The box=
 is just a tool to make the physical connection by making their voices audi=
ble. It is your spiritual connection to the group of spirits around you and=
 the spirits around Frank that makes the communication possible. Frank's "g=
uys" have just become aware of you thats all. The box don't have a signatur=
e or its own aura or give off a certain vibration or whatever you want to c=
all it. It is a group of circuits that are manipulated or operated by spiri=
ts. Everyday before you had a box you still communicated with the spirit gr=
oup around you. Even if only on a subconscious level through influence. Wit=
h the box you still use the same spiritual connection to communicate with t=
hem and they are using a physical medium to communicate with you.Regards,Fr=
ank R.

I =
believe that each box carries it's own signature and the spirits that commu=
nicate through that box know the individual box by the energy it gives off.=
 So they get used to a certain person that has been using that individual b=
ox and when the user changes they get somewhat confused about who is using =
the box. But I think they are getting used to me being the new user. my ses=
sions are becoming more and more responsive. I have posted some file from s=
ession #2 with the box, they are in the files section please let me know wh=
at you think.Bruce
