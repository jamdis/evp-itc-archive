I think you guys understand that.  I want to know everything \nabout it.  I want to experiment.

Is there welding involved? (I dont \ndo it)\n&gt; \n&gt;   I KNEW I should have played with the older boys building radios \nwhen I was in school. But I was way too shy then and only in grade \nschool so I did crafts with the older girls. Advanced classes were \ninteresting but my shyness didnt help. So for the technically \nchallenged (like me) perhaps you could lay out a mock instruction \nplan with a pic or two?\n&gt; \n&gt;   I know quite a few on the group dont need it, and probably \nunderstand what you are saying completely. \n&gt;

    afford it/can spare time. worth the effort IMO for patient \ndetail \n&gt;     conscious researchers which evp-ers seem to be. the described \n&gt;     procedure should work on first or second try for those that can \nput \n&gt;     together crystal receiver and plug it into amplifier.--with \nsmal cap \n&gt;     to ground plug, you could even do it with a tape recorder. all \nlong \n&gt;     wires that can act as antennas can then be removed and only \ndiode or \n&gt;
