<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Chris was the first and only person testing this device for quite some
time, making him the &quot;primary tester&quot;. The dictionary defines the word
&quot;primary&quot; as being or standing first in a list. You offer that he was
also the first to understand how it was supposed to be used. Yet, now
as more and more people weigh in with their own opinions you question
your initial judgment. The fact is that Chris&#x27; opinion of how the box
should be used has never changed. He has held steadfast to his
beliefs. That, my friend, is an honorable trait in this field and a
fact that should be considered. 
Chris has also never claimed this technology to be his own. He has
always and will always give credit where credit is due. He does this
both publicly and privately. 
The use of syntax here on whether we call it Frank&#x27;s Box, The
Telephone to the Dead, Maxi/Mini Box, or Granola in a can is of no
importance. Truly, because Edison&#x27;s plans were never discovered there
is no way to know for sure whether or not your plans are exactly what
Edison was working on. 
There also seems to be a bit of confusion on the role the
&quot;technicians&quot; play in this along with another syntax issue ( could the
words network and technician be used interchangeably?). The
technicians are not interpreters. They can provide assistance to those
spirits too excited or otherwise unable to communicate effectively.
And they, the technicians, also serve to assist higher vibrations come
through (just as your &quot;network&quot;). They can also be of benefit when
lower vibrations try to get through. 
You state you heard a voice say &quot;Edison here&quot; and awhile back you had
posted that you did believe it to in fact be Edison himself. Yet now
you say the &quot;supposed&quot; Edison conversation. 
As for portals... I&#x27;ve made my concerns clear previously known.
However, I have witnessed the box being used in one location only to
have activity spike in another. I&#x27;ve also heard many other stories
related to dark or lower entities. So, perhaps you have had no
experiences yet but, others have and they are speaking up. 
You repeatedly state that Chris is a good guy but then you say &quot;if he
can&#x27;t use it in an honest manner...&quot; What could be more honest than
someone sticking to the same beliefs he&#x27;s held since day one? What
could be more honorable than stating his fears and providing what he
feels is a needed warning? 
Frank, isn&#x27;t it possible that you two both bring something separate to
this device? You, the technology and science said. Chris, the medium
and spiritual side. 
Someone posted separately here about Chris&#x27; ego. I can say this...
having concern for the possible negative fall out to unsuspecting
people is in no way ego ridden. To assume that you know Chris&#x27;
intentions is full of ego. To claim that he only wants to prevent
others from having a device for selfish reasons, is ego&#x27;s way of
telling you that you and everyone else &quot;deserves&quot;  to have what we do
not fully understand. Ego won&#x27;t let you consider that because &quot;you
want what you want when you want it&quot;.
BTW- when the word &quot;harmony&quot; is referred to here it is not a &quot;feeling
inside&quot; like self esteem or some other warm fuzzy. It is about
resonance, vibrations, that which will be matched by like resonance
and vibrations. Harmony.

&gt;  I did, from the begining open this to anyone, and I am not amused
that one person would take the technogoly, claim it as his own, and
attempt to make it exclusive to himself. For one person to say he is
the &quot;primary tester&quot; is inaccurate, he was the first that kinda
understood how it was supposed to be used, or so I thought. I think we
left the &quot;treting phase&quot; some time ago, perhaps it&#x27;s time to return
barrowed equipment?
&gt;  
&gt;  I wasn&#x27;t quite finished with that e-mail-- I hit the send button in
my rush to get off to work. 
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  I put out a box use guideline thing a year or two ago stating that
no one has the right to take my equipment and and claim their use
supercedes anyones else&#x27;s use, or results.
&gt;  
&gt; So, to contiue...
&gt;  
&gt;  As a far as &quot;technicians&quot; I don&#x27;t get any of that stuff, but---they
do talk about a network, and connection to our equipment. When I first
made my &quot;Ghostman&quot; box, last week, it wasn&#x27;t working well, but a day
or so later, it came to life, and one of the voices said it had been
connected to &quot;the network&quot;. Supposedly there is a similar connection
made to computers running EVPmaker. I&#x27;m not sure if these &quot;network&quot;
connections are maintained if equipment is taken out for
investigations, or demostrations. Of cousre, I can&#x27;t say if these
networks are a fact. I would think as maker of the box, these etheric
techs might want to give me, or others some hints.
&gt;  
&gt;  As far as the ghost box, or Frank&#x27;s box, being a &quot;telephone to the
dead&quot;, I think is very poor analogy, the old style phone system of
Edison&#x27;s day had operators, plural, not one person that recieved all
calls, then interpreted what was being said to other parties. That&#x27;s
more of a master control schema.The old phone system didn&#x27;t charge you
an arm and a leg to talk to someone in the same room either! Some
might say these &quot;Technicains&quot; are the operators, but even if anyone
esle could hear these voices, why do you need someone to interpret
what&#x27;s being said. I say if not many can hear it, or something
similar, it ain&#x27;t real! There is a certain kind of conatct, ion that
that your own mind uses the noise as a sort of psychic prop, you hear
the stuff in your head, it may be accurate and real inforamntiion, but
no one else is going to hear it. i think that what all this supposed
converstions wiht Edison maybe.  I have in fact heard a voice that
said &quot;Edison here&quot; but there was no other real information conveyed
that I could understand. 
&gt;  As for portals, demons and evil spirits entering the world through
these &quot;unauthorized&quot; boxes, I an only say, as the original mker of the
box, I have gotten voices cuzzing, swearing, name calling, and even
threatening, but nothing that has seemingly &quot;entered&quot; our world. Even
those &quot;threatening entities&quot;, when pressed to bring it, fold up like
paper tigers. These beings and spirits already exist all around us,
and at a higher level, so they have full access to this, a lower
lever. Besides. There is that &quot;network&quot; that seem to allow for better
contacts, and kinda helps highter being to come through. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I made these &quot;boxes&quot;! The idea was not &quot;Edisons Telephone...&quot; What
I got was an assemblage of my own expereince and knowlegde, put
together by my own mind as answer to my question of what else could I
use for spirit comuncation. All technology involved was based on what
I had worked on in the past for radio experimentation. I had in fact,
a couple years before my interest in EVP, been experimenting with
voltage tunable radio modules removed from car stereos for AM DX,
that&#x27;s listening to distant AM radio stations. I was hoping to find
other talk shows similar to Art Bell, and there used to be one out of
Cincinati(?). The idea of using a random voltage to tune the radio was
after using EVPmaker, which uses a method of generating random speech
bits for the entities to use. It was a small leap to apply the random
technique to an anolog system. I am not the first to be focusing on a
problem, and have the mind provide an solution in complete form.
Nothing mystical about it. The fact is, after much work, and
experimenting, the tuning doesn&#x27;t have to be random, a linear tuning
works much better. Yet another fact of  the box, covienently ignored.
&gt;  
&gt;  What really chaps my hide, as maker of the box, is to have someone,
who knows nothing of electronics, and technology completely ignore
everything I say about the box, and presume to tell me how it really
works, how it should be used, and what is acceptable from it. This guy
is so honest, he won&#x27;t even use his real name, but huff and puff at at
anyone that contradicts his use of my equipment. I say, as &quot;a Tester&quot;
if you can&#x27;t use it in an honest manor, bring the stuff back--testing
over! Like it or not, the public has this technology, you can keep
pissing and moaning, trying to spread fear, or you could choose the
way of Light.
