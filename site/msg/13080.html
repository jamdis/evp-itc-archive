<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was on a recent investigation where we were told getting angry and into 
fights seemed to get the best response from whatever was there.  We just 
couldn&#x27;t bring ourselves to do that, though. We couldn&#x27;t bring ourselves 
to provoke or challenge anything, either. However, asking it politely to 
do something - anything - did get a response once.

&gt; It depends on what is going on.  Since the focus on the investigation is
&gt; more than just gathering EVPs  sometimes there needs to be more
&gt; chatter.   Actual investigations can take hours and sometimes several
&gt; visits, so what you see on a show is maybe 8-10 hours compressed into 45
&gt; minutes.     As far as thanking the spirits, again it depends on what is
&gt; needed and the personality of the investigator.
&gt;
&gt; Researching at home is a lot different- at home you are in your comfort
&gt; zone,  I have a residual energy that walks down my hallway, I have seen
&gt; it a hundred times, and it never freaks me out.  But if I see something
&gt; out on an investigation- in a strange location where I am out of my
&gt; comfort zone, it will freak me out a little-- get the heart racing.  And
&gt; I have been known to ask what the H-E double hockey sticks was that?
&gt; Now I will run towards something- others instinctively  start to run
&gt; away- again it depends the personality and experience of the
&gt; investigator, lol and the vocabulary.
&gt;
&gt; In a team envvironment usually and in my opinion, hopefully, you have a
&gt; variety of styles and personalities.  I personally think that works
&gt; better since you never know who might attract a response.
