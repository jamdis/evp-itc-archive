Don&#39;t let the \n&gt; title fool you, because it is really a long  one, partly me talking, and them \n&gt; answering, even though it&#39;s title is short,  it&#39;s actually a long file.  I \n&gt; finally figured out how to convert to MP  format with the Gold Wave \n&gt; program.daaa, nobody&#39;s perfect!  When you  have heard my new files, I will be removing \n&gt; them, so I can upload more new ones  I got last Friday.  If no one is \n&gt; interested please let me know, and I won&#39;t  upload them as it&#39;s time consuming.  I \n&gt; hear all your files, and I  think they are great!  What we&#39;ve been given \n&gt; here is a great  blessing.SF\n&gt;"}
