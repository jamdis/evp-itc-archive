<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I hadn&#x27;t heard the term before, but from the literature I&#x27;ve seen it is a
source of electromagnetic energy that sweeps from 0 to 250 Hz. It probably
uses a loop as the field source and wouldn&#x27;t have much of a range. You could
probably build one for $20 or less depending on how knowledgeable you were
and how good a scrounger. Using a microcontroller and scrounged parts it
might be as low as $5 to build. I&#x27;m an EE by profession; I can think of
several ways to go about it.
It&#x27;s not the same as Frank&#x27;s box or any other receiver. It isn&#x27;t a receiver.
I guess it is either supposed to enhance reception or actually attract
ghosts as an energy source.

&gt; So let me ask you this then: An EM Pump= amplified white noise? If that&#x27;s
&gt; the case, a hacked RS radio using it&#x27;s speaker constitutes an EM Pump. or is
&gt; it something else entirely? Basically Frank&#x27;s Box is an EM pump. Or not but
&gt; maybe so. LOL! FM modulators for MP3 players, I have a few. FM sweeps okay
&gt; for white noise? How do I get a Belkin TuneCast II to keep scanning? I&#x27;ll
&gt; let you know if I find out.

I hadn&#x27; hea d he e m be o e, bu om he li e a u e I&#x27; e seen i is a sou ce o elec omagne ic ene gy ha sweeps om 0 o 250 Hz. I p obably uses a loop as he ield sou ce and wouldn&#x27; ha e much o a ange. You could p obably build one o $20 o less depending on how knowledgeable you we e and how good a sc ounge .

So le me ask you his hen: An EM Pump= ampli ied whi e noise? I ha &#x27;s he case, a hacked RS adio using i &#x27;s speake cons i u es an EM Pump. o is i some hing else en i ely?
