I&#39;m wondering how many of us are doing some sort of protective meditation or prayer before we use the box?  (BTW, I am NOT a religious person, but I ask for protection anyway.)  Also wondering, how many of us have noticed an increase in seemingly psychic abilities or strange happenings after starting to use the box?"}
