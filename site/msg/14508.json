I love how he says that Frank charges thousands of dollars for an original Frank&#39;s box. \n\nThis dude is the worst type of con, preying on people who know only enough to be familiar with the term Frank&#39;s box. Then again, it always has bothered me when people take shack hacks and charge stupid prices for them on ebay under the Frank&#39;s box moniker.\n\nThis guy is based out of Nevada I believe, and his group&#39;s ethics leave little to be desired. Takes all kinds, I reckon...\n\nAndy\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Aquarius &lt;laustin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmmm... saw this on Ebay tonight... you&#39;ve got to read all the text to hear\n&gt; how he describes what he&#39;s selling. \n&gt; \n&gt; Do any of you on this list know who he is?
