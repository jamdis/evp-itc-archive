<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is basically the &quot;buzz stick&quot; setup from lessemf.com Any suction 
cup type mic pickup and amplified speaker can work in a similar fashion 
as it is basically a single axis emf probe. I suppose according to the 
traditional evp coil induction theory that it could work, but about 4 
years ago I did extensive testing with this type of pickup on a yamaha 
4 track recorder with diodes and microphones on other tracks. The only 
success I had was with the tracks that had a regular microphone 
attached. As I understand it, this device transforms the em frequency 
to it&#x27;s corresponsing audible frequency, sortof a &quot;reverse mic&quot;.

I have never had any success in it&#x27;s use, but it certainly is a cheap 
way to experiment. I don&#x27;t see a connection to a Frank&#x27;s box by 
functionality, Frank&#x27;s boxes and similar model ghost boxes are much 
more complex and sophisticated. You can think of the above as an 
audible emf sensor.

Hope it helps,
Andy
