That even was suppose to be Mansfied.  But as far as I know there was  no 
taping donae at all and definitely NO live broadcast event.  But yes the  event 
was billed out as a Paranormal underworld event.

Well, this guy said there hasn't been a live event in over 2 years, or  any 
attempt to do one. I just want to know why there's an event scheduled for  July 
2008 if that's the case.

The website, www.paranormalunder _world.com_ (http://world.com/)  is still 
up, and there  is an
event advertised that was supposed to take place in July of this  year.
What's up with that?
