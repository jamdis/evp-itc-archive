That's a much better term - Cynic.

Thanks!

  Healthy =
debate is one thing. Yes, it can be a good thing. I am not saying don't exc=
hange viewpoints with people. But it is only healthy debate if both parties=
 are willing to consider the other's opinion. I bet you no matter what Fran=
k were to say, these people would never consider a word he says.

  Just as=
 you say, there has to be a mutual respect between parties in order to carr=
y on and intelligent debate, like we are doing with this discussion.

  Fra=
nk can stand up all he wants if that is want he wants to do, but for all th=
at, he won't change these people's opinions, and in the end he will only in=
vite more hassle from them.

  He should see that these people and their op=
inions don't mean anything to his own personal growth, research and knowled=
ge.

  Engaging these types in petty argument just drains you of your energ=
y. There is no winner. It is a waste of time and energy. Energy that could =
have been put to a much worthier task. It is much better to take the high r=
oad and leave the haters to themselves.
