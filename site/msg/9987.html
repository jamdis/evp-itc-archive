editing EVP... sorry for that! ;-)

Well, much has been said, and I see both sides: One side are messages
themselves which serve to gain knowledge about the spirit world (or
whatever we are contacting). The other side is the scientific aspect of
this research. In my view, both sides are equally important.

Especially in the field of borderland sciences, transparency is most
important to maintain credibility. It's not about convincing skeptics
but to be taken serious by really interested people. We shouldn't give
them unnecessary reasons for doubt in this important research if it can
be avoided easily.
