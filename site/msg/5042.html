&gt; I see that there is some speculation about the eBay auctions so want
&gt; to put it to bed...
&gt;
&gt; As I stated at the beginning of the MiniBox project, the goal is to
&gt; get as many MiniBoxes into researchers&#x27; hands as possible, and
&gt; considered eBay as a marketing possibility. I arranged for two Boxes
&gt; to go on the block with no reserves to see what open bidding would
&gt; bring.
&gt;
&gt; As it happens, both units went to active researchers on this forum,
&gt; so in that respect I&#x27;m glad it worked out that way. However both
&gt; units went at low prices, one below cost, so in order to survive we
&gt; had to set a reserve for future auctions.
&gt;
&gt; We have also solicited active feedback from all our users so that
&gt; new ideas and improvements can be added down the line. I&#x27;m pleased
&gt; that Bruce and Steve have been extremely helpful with their ideas
&gt; and suggestions.
&gt;
&gt; Also, I want it understood that Frank and I have an ongoing dialog
&gt; regarding designs, uses of the Box, improvements and so on. We have
&gt; a free and open exchange of ideas. I have asked him to let me know
&gt; if he ever has any problems with using his name. Moreover, anyone
&gt; reading the literature and comments regarding Frank that I have made
&gt; can see that they are solely to give him credit for his work, and to
&gt; quote things he has said or written to me.
&gt;
&gt; I think many good things come from persons dedicated to a goal. I
&gt; commend Mike C. for his efforts re: the Shack Hack, and consider it
&gt; a great starting place for those who are technically inclined and on
&gt; a budget. The search for other suitable radios should commence, if
&gt; it hasn&#x27;t already. The key is to cooperate with each other and share
&gt; information and results. ASUP will be holding an orientation class
&gt; and training session for users of the Box at its next meeting. They
&gt; will be researching using a strict testing protocol, and recording
&gt; each session as it happens. Over time, teams using the same gear
&gt; should be able to collect information which can be collated and
&gt; studied for patterns. This is the next step in ITC research, and one
&gt; which can provide the hard evidence.
