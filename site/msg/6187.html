<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Her daughter Becky accompanied Sarah to the AA-EVP meeting and has 
been the contact for that group since Sarah&#x27;s passing but Becky told 
me that never was able to involve herself with this work and remained 
a skeptic. But a child would recognize their parents voice better 
(and vice versa) than anyone. I&#x27;ll be glad to make an inquiry to see 
if she is interested in listening. -Bill

&gt; &gt; , something tells me I will.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you or anyone you know is familiar with her family, you may 
want  
&gt; &gt; to let them know she is ok and in communication
&gt; &gt; and where they can hear the files.

&gt; Bruce--will you send those Sarah files to me at my personal e-mail 
as  
&gt; attachments and I will get them to Sarah&#x27;s family and friends.
