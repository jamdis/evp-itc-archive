<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve just finished two days at the American Ghost Society conference where I was blown away by a presentation by April Slaughter on Andy Coppock&#x27;s ITC Probe.

What do you guys know about this?

She played a good portion of an eleven minute interactive, full sentence conversation that she had with her grandfather who died seven years ago.

Unless this is a hoax, which I would hope that an MIT graduate and biomedical engineer wouldn&#x27;t be part of, this is extraordinary.

We heard full sentences in the same voice throughout. The words were understandable with intonation coming through.

I was utterly blown away.  

Coppock is doing a controlled study with it, using other scientists and a few ghost hunters.</pre>
