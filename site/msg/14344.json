I do know my EVP&#39;s are very LOW audio. I need to work w=\r\nith that and AMP them I guess. In some recordings (1927 is one of them) I c=\r\nan&#39;t hear the voice sometimes, that is how low it is. But tonight I finishe=\r\nd my comparison recorder evaluations (ran 3 recorders that night) my Sony I=\r\nCD B7 also heard the date. The Panasonic RR-US360 could not hear it. I will=\r\n upload a GET-OUT evp that the RR-DR60 only heard too. Was recorded same ti=\r\nme as the asking of date.As for &quot;what kind of ears I have&quot; :) I do have pre=\r\ntty good hearing (but have some loss in certain areas) maybe my losses are =\r\ncloser to the static&#39;s level and I am helped there....I don&#39;t know yet. I h=\r\nave seen enough people (half) that I personally let hear these....they can&#39;=\r\nt hear them either (some of them) so I understand why others can&#39;t hear the=\r\nm.

I does have a cadence similar to someone speaking, =\r\nbut it could just as easily be something present in the environment-a natur=\r\nal background noise. There is no way for me to tell for certain as it is ju=\r\nst too feint. I can&#39;t make out any clear words. Sure-I could probably matri=\r\nx some in, but that is all it would be. For an EVP to be considered proof p=\r\nositive of spirit communication by the community at large, it has to be cle=\r\nar enough that many people hear the same thing, without hints or coaxing. I=\r\nf you have to have high quality devices to make it out, it just isn&#39;t good =\r\nenough. That does not mean it isn&#39;t a true EVP, just that it isn&#39;t good eno=\r\nugh to stand as evidence. As for the whistle, it sounded like feedback to m=\r\ne as well, but I will have to take you word for it that you were no where n=\r\near any other electronics or EMF&#39;s that could contribute to feedback. Even =\r\nso, if I am trying to remain unbiased and objective, there is no way for me=\r\n to say this is a spirit, without personally being with you when you caught=\r\n it. The only thing I can still say about it is could be, but for me it is =\r\nnon conclusive. If someone does not hear what you are hearing, try to remai=\r\nn objective and just understand that it isn&#39;t personal. You have to underst=\r\nand that with just these recordings alone, there is no way to scientificall=\r\ny prove what you have recorded is spirit communication. If you could get co=\r\nnsistent, intelligent question and answer recordings, then you would be alo=\r\nt closer. Here again, we are back to the &quot;So what?&quot; thing. You don&#39;t HAVE t=\r\no prove anything scientifically, unless you want others to completely belie=\r\nve in your evidence. The theory that is being kicked around is that some EV=\r\nP&#39;s are personal, and only meant for the person recording them to hear. If =\r\nthis is the case, no matter how clear something is to you, others may not h=\r\near it. April ----- Original Message ----- From: James W.

If you can&#39;=\r\nt hear them then it must be either mechanical (sound card or headphones)or =\r\nmaybe your hearing has loss in those frequencies....Some of these are not v=\r\nery clear or loud enough too. But many will depend on your computer sound c=\r\nard & your headphones. I have let an older man listen (in his late 60&#39;s) an=\r\nd he has heard most all of the audio. Same with a few guys at work. Some he=\r\nar them right away, and others can&#39;t until I loop the actually EVP for a fe=\r\nw tries. I personally use a Dell Latitude D430 to hear these. I can hear so=\r\nme on my cell phone. Headphones are a must....or you won&#39;t hear anything ei=\r\nther way. *But some can be heard on cell phone without headphones. The conv=\r\nersion to MP3 has also caused some loss, but I am still able to hear them w=\r\nhen I review from this site (but I have the repetive hearing syndrome in th=\r\nis area no doubt). Although I do have some disbelief (shock) that a few of =\r\nthese are not discernable. Go back and listen to &quot;tomorrow let you know&quot; is=\r\n in a gruffy-robotic melodic tone at the very end but with higher natural v=\r\nolume. And if you couldn&#39;t hear the whistle...I would suggest the need to r=\r\nemove the cotton from the ear :) As for feedback.....feedback from what? I =\r\nonly had one recorder working here. I would rather hear someone say &quot;I&quot; mad=\r\ne the whistle....that would be more understandable. And is very true....if =\r\nsomeone &quot;tells&quot; the group that THIS is supposed to be what WAS said, then i=\r\ns very difficult to clear the mind to hear it any other way.

For an EVP to be =\r\nconsidered proof positive of spirit communication \n  by the community at la=\r\nrge, it has to be clear enough that many people hear the \n  same thing, wit=\r\nhout hints or coaxing. If you have to have high quality devices \n  to make =\r\nit out, it just isn&#39;t good enough. That does not mean it isn&#39;t a true \n  EV=\r\nP, just that it isn&#39;t good enough to stand as evidence.

Even so, if I am trying to remain unbiase=\r\nd and \n  objective, there is no way for me to say this is a spirit, without=\r\n personally \n  being with you when you caught it. The only thing I can stil=\r\nl say about it is \n  could be, but for me it is non conclusive. If someone =\r\ndoes not hear what you \n  are hearing, try to remain objective and just und=\r\nerstand that it isn&#39;t \n  personal. You have to understand that with just th=\r\nese recordings alone, there \n  is no way to scientifically prove what you h=\r\nave recorded is spirit \n  communication. If you could get consistent, intel=\r\nligent question and answer \n  recordings, then you would be alot closer. He=\r\nre again, we are back to the &quot;So \n  what?&quot; thing. You don&#39;t HAVE to prove a=\r\nnything scientifically, unless you want \n  others to completely believe in =\r\nyour evidence. The theory that is being kicked \n  around is that some EVP&#39;s=\r\n are personal, and only meant for the person \n  recording them to hear.
