Hello,
I have been listening in and watching some of your videos. My name is San. 
I think once the spirits know that you are open for business, that they 
begin to know who you are and come to you. I can see many spirits on the ghost 
shows before the TV folks do. I get headaches and pains where the bullets 
went in around the same time that the other mediums on the shows do. Its a 
matter of intent, spiritual intent. You are letting them know that you are one 
that will listen and then they begin to show up. But it takes awhile for them 
to tune to your mind frequently but once they get used to it I guess it 
will just happen. 
San

the visual mode the spirit only has to suppress the light spots and enhance 
the dark spots that do not match the image it is sending----Light and dark 
spots on the screen that correspond to the image dont have to be modulated at 
all---the result is a SAVING of "psychic energy" on the observers part, 
perhaps not much, but enough to make the difference between seeing and NOT 
seeing, however. Random sound would work the same way only the frequencies that 
did not match the sounds being sent would have to be blocked or replaced, 
the frequencies already present would NOT have to be modulated--so SOME energy 
is saved and not as much effort is needed to hear the entity. Effectively 
enhancing one's innate abilities. It a lot easier to hear a spirit sound if 
some of the waves are already in place, than it would be if you had to build 
the entire word from scratch.
