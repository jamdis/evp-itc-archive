<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>OK, I have to chime in here.

A name is just a name.  Because I put Edison on the box has no bearing on whether or not he actually achieved spirit communications.  The SB#3 was labeled Edison strictly for the person that wanted it.  He said Edison helps and has helped him and there is no reason he cannot have Edison on his box.

The fact is, it is a scanning radio to try to pick up the voices from spirits.  Come on. bitching about a name.  Glad my name isn&#x27;t Edison.

For you Frank,  not a single part of your circuit design went into SB#3.  I did analyze your design and found many flaws especially in the Random noise circuit.  For that reason alone, I could not use it.  I am not trying to put you down in any way; you were the one that brought radio scanning into the forefront.

I have been designing electronic circuits since I was 7yrs old.  I am 41 now.  I completely understand electronics and love to push the limits of physics and beyond.  This radio sweep circuit is nothing.  It is not complicated electronics at all.  Just do a few calculations to make sure you are amplifying and filtering correctly and build.  I find this rather basic.

I am sorry you feel I took your box design by using wood.  Maybe I will use a different stain on the next one.

I will get some videos of the different modes of operation on the o-scope., just so you can see for yourself, my circuit functions as I intended it too.

If you would like, I can markup your schematics so your random circuit will function correctly.  You just need to remove and replace a  component, and change a few values.  Your random circuit was off right from the very first component.  How can you possibly get a reliable low frequency random noise circuit without using a known noise amount to begin with?

I am not hear to bash anyone, and I do not expect that myself.  I am sorry you feel the way you do Frank, but you are entitled to feel how ever you want.  If you would like to continue bashing, I can meet you blow for blow technically and I know I will win.

Enough said.  I will back up my circuit with proof!
