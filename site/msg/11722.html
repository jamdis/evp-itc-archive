Hi Deb=
bie,
 
The puck is not the same thing as the Ovilus 1.  The puck has to be
=
attached to a computer to be used.  The Ovilus 1 is a handeld device and
ne=
eds an external speaker.  I found out today that it appeared on
paranormal =
States but this device has been out for a few months now.
Unfortunately I h=
ave to sell some of my toys so I can purchase a few
more toys that are a bi=
t pricey.  These are the boss's rules so I have
to abide by them.  I could =
put it out there on Ebay but I wanted to give
someone here a chance to purc=
hase it for the price that I paid for it
rather than the price of a new one=
.
