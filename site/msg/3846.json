That&#39;s why I don&#39;t bring up the bad stuff much, since \nit&#39;s a miniscule amount of what&#39;s generally reported on EVPs. \nShamanically speaking, I&#39;m very interested in Tulpas, so I&#39;d love to \nhear your experience in greater depth.\n\nA really wild turn of the screw recently happened after my group, \nDAPS, conducted an investigation at haunted house in Gainesville, \nTexas. The homeowner can&#39;t keep renters in it, so she&#39;s begun \nallowing paranormal investigators to come and check it out. We had \nquite a number of digital audio recorders running there, but what has \nus floored is the nature of what we picked up. \n\nThe mindblowing aspects are as follows: First, that we got a huge \nnumber EVPs, more than any other location we&#39;ve ever gone to before. \nAnd secondly, many of the EVPs, from various researcher&#39;s recorders \nhave the unmistakable sounds of people having sex. Moans, groans, and \ncussing, with whips and screams included!\n\nI am not kidding around or exagerating. Out of respect, I&#39;ll refrain \nfrom being explicit. Let me just say that if anyone wishes to verify \nthe EVPs our investigator Jennifer captured, you&#39;re welcome to \ndownload the Gainesville house.zip of her wavs - \nhttp://www.filecrunch.com/file/%7Ecmkvx0\n\nI&#39;m still working on getting my EVPs onto the PC and uploaded, but \nthey&#39;re part and parcel of the same carnal activities. After I aquire \nand synchronize myself with my MiniBox, I&#39;m going back to see if \nanyone will give it a rest long enough to sing a few syllables... \nYes, we recorded singing there as well.\n\nI suppose the randy EVPs shouldn&#39;t be a surprise since the place was  \nformerly a notoriously rumored Speak Easy during prohibition.\n\nDoes all this fall into the catagory of too much information?!\n\nLOL!\n\nLance \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I had one of those moments myself, Lance, albeit at a slightly \nlater  \n&gt; age, but in my case, the Tulpa I was battling was my own creation.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a journalist, so yes, I ask a lot of pointed questions. I am  \n&gt; trying to bolster a point, however: spirit communication is more  \n&gt; beneficial than detrimental. You ask a person how many wonderful  \n&gt; things came of it and you readily get responses; you ask how many  \n&gt; people have had bad ones and you get stories about other people&#39;s  \n&gt; problems, in the main.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Dec 3, 2007, at 10:35 PM, Lance Oliver wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Ann,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Damn, you are a determined woman! ;-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Very well. If you must know, yes I&#39;ve confronted darkness face to\n&gt; &gt; face. What some would call evil... calling my name.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was but a small child at the time, looking through crib slats. \nLong\n&gt; &gt; ago but never forgotten. Something I now know was a war for my \nsoul\n&gt; &gt; took place, as much as that is odd to relate. Pleasing terror \nyawned\n&gt; &gt; wide, like sharp toothed jaws on one side, yet a light of infinite\n&gt; &gt; power and truth, a lighthouse within, finally sent her away, along\n&gt; &gt; with a simple decision I made, to embrace the highest and best.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s about as much as I wish to say, since many will not \nunderstand\n&gt; &gt; let alone believe, until such a thing is revealed to them, as it \nwas\n&gt; &gt; to me. It is so difficult to put such forces from within and \nbeyond\n&gt; &gt; into words, and even harder to understand.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; LOL!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Suffice it to say I am a believer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My quest in this life is to play a small part, a singular role, \nlike\n&gt; &gt; a tiny ripple in the vast sea.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nothing more.
