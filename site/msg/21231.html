&gt; Got lots of great files in there, Frank, these two are not a drop in the  
&gt; buckett to what you got here, a few spirits coming into the light see they 
&gt; are  &quot;naked&quot; one asks for some one to &quot;throw down pants&quot;  and of course I 
&gt; asked  David what this is all about, He says that while they are in the lower  
&gt; plains  they cannot see and are in total darkness they are &quot;all naked&quot; they  
&gt; can&#x27;t really see each other.  But when each steps up into the light, it&#x27;s  
&gt; like a little arched doorway, with three small steps going up, and a  small 
&gt; place to stand and kneel down, which is what they are all  asked to do before 
&gt; they go in when they are coming out  of the lower  plain.
&gt;  
&gt; Once they enter the light is when they can see that they are naked, it  
&gt; might be one reason, He takes them in only one at a time, maybe.  Then  someone 
&gt; in the light covers or gives them a spirit rope to cover them up as they  
&gt; come in, then after they meet with Jesus, and He talks to them for about 10  
&gt; minutes our time, He wants everyone within the fold, but they must forgive  
&gt; everyone that has ever hurt them plus be willing to make up for harm they 
&gt; did  while on Earth, and believe in what Christ did for them.  It is then 
&gt; where  they go to see the guardian angels, and the loved ones, and go to their  
&gt; new homes.   In these two files, I hear, &quot;throw down pants&quot; in the other  
&gt; one, I hear, &quot;we&#x27;re naked!&quot;  &quot;me too.&quot;   If a person dies a  believer all 
&gt; ready, you don&#x27;t need to go through that but, are already in the  light when one 
&gt; dies, there is no need to cross over because you are already  there so to 
&gt; speak.  At least that is the way Tech David describes things.  sf
