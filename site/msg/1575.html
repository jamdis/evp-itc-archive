<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce;

I&#x27;m trying to get to point where I can get this stuff in production, there&#x27;s 
just so many variable that I haven&#x27;t quite solved yet.  I have the tuner 
problems solved, and now trying to address the intelligibility problem of 
the voices, that&#x27;s where you can tell someone is talking, but it&#x27;s guess as 
to what&#x27;s being said. Contrary to what was presented on the C2C show, I 
don&#x27;t have this down to a science yet.  Then making it handipcaped usable, 
that&#x27;s a whole new set of challenges.

Frank
