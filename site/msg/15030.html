So-

Sounds waves are separate and apart from the electromagnetic spectrum?=

        Sorry, RJ. I stand corrected! Soundwaves are not EM w=
aves because they lack the EM component and are subject to our physical env=
ironment. Hence, cannot travel at the speed of light. 

        That being =
said, the heterodyne theory still stands. LOL

                Tell me where the seperation on the sp=
ectrum takes place between 300Hz and 300KHz. Yes, soundwaves cause pressure=
 waves that our ears read as vibration and our mind translates as sound. Th=
e waves are still on the electromagnetic spectrum. Even subsonic geomagneti=
c waves are present on the scale. What I mean by power can be directll tran=
slated to volume or amplitude. The only thing that distinguishes soundwaves=
 from any other wave is the fact that we can hear them.

     No. Sounds waves are not on the electromagnet spectrum nor are they a =

                                It sounds like she'=

                                A mistake that =
a lot of people make is thinking that there are two different types of ener=
gy at work when it comes to sound waves and electromagnetic waves. The only=
 thing that seperates them is frequency and power. Radio waves are radio wa=
ves because they occupy a certain block of the electromagnietic spectrum. S=
ound waves exist on that same spectrum just farther down with much longer w=
aves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can penetrate almost anything because o=
f their wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength the more ways we can shield=
 against them.

                                Think of microwaves. These =
are also a type of radio and telemetry transmitting wave but the waves also=
 have a physical effect on our environment by causing molecules to speed up=
, which creates heat. A little lower than this is IR or infrared it too can=
 cause physical objects to heat up but usually it just causes molecules to =
rotate in place. All physical things give off IR light. Its a way the total=
 system conserves energy by spontaneously emitting IR radiation.

                                Here is some food for thought. I am=
 currently reviewing my audio from our May 30th investigation.

           =
                     It was me and another girl teammate present in the roo=
m. I picked up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry=
 with me. We were standing right next to another digital video recorder tha=
t I leave beside my night vision camera. That recorder did not pick up this=
 3rd voice. I have asked the girl that was with me to check her recording t=
o see if she picked it up.

                                I have long fel=
t the true EVP does not come from sound waves in the environment, or then i=
t wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are appearing dir=
ectly on the recordings.

                                This instance wit=
h the recorders may back that theory up. That other recorder should have pi=
cked that voice up if it were sound waves in the environment.

            =
                    I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The file tha=
t is named "01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip. You will hear my voice as I sa=
y "Yeah", and then another comes in right after that. I think I know what i=
t says.

                                Again, I was live monitoring my au=
dio, but still did not hear this until playback. It isn't clear, so I am no=
t as excited about it as my one's from the last investigation.

                                I have a running theory that EVP is carried=
 on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to manife=
st. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves =
that differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them toget=
her you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghos=
t is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creat=
ing an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate diff=
erence frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). =
This was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic=
 signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP w=
ere generated within a few inches of the recorder.

                       =
         We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radio with superh=
eterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some passive sona=
rs and a commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pomp=
eii.

                                I am curious if an=
yone with a microphone wired to a remote site has ever gotten any EVP in re=
al time.

                                I took part in an investigation o=
f Ashmore Estates, near Ashmore IL, on Saturday night. We had six video cam=
eras set up in the three halls of the building. The video for all was being=
 monitored and recorded at a central location. Alas, we did not have microp=

                                <DIV>I have a runni=

onic wave and demodulated exactly 
                                where th=
ey want it to manifest. It works off the 
                                h=
eterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic 
                           =
     waves that differ one another in frequency then 
                     =
           if you add or subtract them together you get a 
                =
                beat frequency or alternate frequency. For 
               =

        =

  =

                                have a intermediate difference freq=
