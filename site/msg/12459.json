No recording duels here, nobody cares anyway.  \nWhat would that serve?

I will say that I&#39;ve heard\n&gt; who first came up with the RS Hack and your\n&gt; name wasn&#39;t it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have posted many of my recordings to this\n&gt; list, but don&#39;t store them here. I&#39;ve also heard\n&gt; your files. So? Nothing I haven&#39;t heard before,\n&gt; but as always I enjoy listening to everyone&#39;s efforts.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I don&#39;t like is an attitude and egomania\n&gt; when it comes to this research.\n&gt; \n&gt; Next I guess you&#39;ll challenge me to a recording\n&gt; duel? LOL. Give that ego a rest.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Oct 9, 2008, at 7:31 PM, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You&#39;re right and i&#39;m not here to argue with anyone. You obviously\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know me, but dislike me. That&#39;s ok, i like to get along with\n&gt; &gt; people; it helps the research move forward. I would love to hear \nsome\n&gt; &gt; of your files from your frank&#39;s boxes and compare notes on what \nwe&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; been getting. My results are in the files section here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Steve\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, black bear hollow  \n&gt; &gt; &lt;blackbearhollow@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So have I.
