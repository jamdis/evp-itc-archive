I did not send this to you Frank, I do NOT spread rumors, and it was  not 
right for someone to be so cruel to to send this to you.  So shame on  that 
person whomever it was, I think we owe this research to you, and to other's  
in the field, like a man called Meek from the 60's, he did lots of research, 
we  would not be able to know how to do this if not for you guys.  This 
stops  here, I don't think he meant this to slight you anyway, I would have 
loved to  have one of your box', people that spred rumors have a problem. sf

Bonnie,

The small 20-125 you have is light years ahead of  the Frank's box in the 
quality of communication it allows you to receive. I  have had the two 
Frank's box #'S 12 and 29. #12 was stolen from me by a low  life that took 
advantage of my generosity. That is another story.
I still  have Frank's box #29, the reason you never hear files from me 
using that box  is because it literally "Sucks!"

Most if not all Frank's box is  inherently filled with static white noise 
and that combined with a metal echo  box and noise generator makes it very 
difficult to hear anything let alone  communication which is difficult enough 
to hear from a quiet box likes the  125.

Frank's box has seen it's day and served it's purpose in my  opinion it is 
antiquated and is no where near the quality of even a small  cheap RS 12-469 
as far as clarity of communication.

Frank is  actually using the guts from RS hacks to build his boxes now so 
why have a  "FRANKENBOX" that is essentially an RS hack with noise added 
instead of just  buying an RS box and getting better communication?F

Mind you  this is only my opinion but it is based on years of experience 
with every box  that is or has been used. I currently have 14 different boxes 
not to mention  EVP maker and I have done extensive sessions and research 
with each and for my  money you can give me a 20-125 every time, the Frank's 
box should be retired  to the box museum where it belongs.

I am the only person in this  research that will come out and speak the 
truth about the Frank's box, there  are many people now that have them and the 
only person you will ever hear a  file from is Steve Hula and sometimes 
Frank himself, and Frank's file is so  rough you may hear 1 out of a hundred 
files the way he does due to the fact  that he does not even take the time to 
do a proper session he just turns the  box on and records a couple of minute 
using his CELL PHONE  !

Frank has his place in RTSC history due to his ALLEGED  invention off the 
first ghost box and he deserves the respect for his  "POSSIBLE" 
accomplishment but to be revered as a god in the box field NO not  by me anyway.

I use the words "ALLEGED" and "POSSIBLE" in terms  of his being the first 
to create the ghost box due to some recent information  that has been brought 
to my attention that concerns an individual that  created, built and used A 
Radio Sweeping Ghost Box in 1969.

I am  gathering information and documentation now and will hopefully be 
able to  dispel the myth of Frank assumption being the father of the ghost Box  
soon.

That is to be continued! 
 
 
 
All is possible, nothing is probable
 
Bruce
