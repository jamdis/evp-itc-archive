Nope you are fine. Everyone hears things different. Also has alot to do wit=
h speaker setups etcetera. Spirit will adjust to you and you will gain an e=
ar to hear them better the effort you put in, the more they reciprocate..

I use bass boost x-bass stereo speakers rather than pc speakers. I neve=

It helps when they use a=

thod for my recordings, then there is no deciding what is what. I suggest y=
ou start out recording short sessions. I usually record sweep for about 3 m=
inutes at most. With water its always about 30 seconds of recording time an=
d that recording can contain 1-30 messages on -74 speed. The speech is usua=

ech is way outside normal human speech rates.

Attaching a recent h2o cl=

 if you will hear this so I chose a short one of someone saying "I spoke" t=
