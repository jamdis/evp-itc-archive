<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree, Bruce.  Some of the results have been mind-boggling!

I hope more people will give this combination it a try.

Thank again, Stefan, for opening the door to  another chapter in this journey toward two-
way communication.   :-)

&gt; Hey guy&#x27;s,
&gt; 
&gt; This EVPM program is turning out to be really something. I have done 
&gt; about 5 sessions with it and can say, in my opinion it rivals any box 
&gt; and even surpasses a couple.
&gt; 
&gt; I am working on the last recording now, and it is the best yet!
&gt; These files are from the last recording. 
&gt; 
&gt; This method seems to just get better with every session. I think the 
&gt; tech powers that be should start working on development along this line.
&gt; 
&gt; I have done alot of real time communication research and this method is 
&gt; one of the best so far.
