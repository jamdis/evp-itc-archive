That&#39;s wonderful your are in a financial position to be so generous. :-) \n\nI don&#39;t know if we can really go so far as to say that people who buy from eBay are \nreceiving units with the wrong kind of energy attached, just because profiting from sales \nisn&#39;t a course of action you or I, nor some others would take.  If that is the case, where do \nwe draw the line?  I paid a hefty price for my MiniBox, as have many others.  I&#39;m sure there \nis some profit involved there.  The energy of it seems just fine to me and I hold no \ndisregard toward Ron for recognizing there is a market for his devices.\n\nPerhaps those who log onto eBay looking to find something so they can experiment with \nautomated sweep feel it&#39;s their lucky day when they discover such a listing?  Maybe they \neven feel it&#39;s a &#39;sign&#39; that it&#39;s the right thing for them to do some research.  And as far as \nthe seller is concerned, we don&#39;t know what their attitude or motivation is, unless we know \nthem personally.  Reminds me of a person on the cleaning crew who used to steal the food \nfrom the fridge at one of my corporate jobs.  Everyone was so harsh and judgmental about \nit, until one day, we learned she was feeding her hungry children!\n\nEven if the person selling the units is the most greedy person in the world, I fully believe it \nis far more the attitude and intention of the person conducting the experiments which \ninfluence the energy of communication devices, than the attitude of the people selling the \ndevices.  It&#39;s my opinion WE are the ones who attract what comes through to us on our \nequipment, much more so than the equipment itself.  \n\nMargaret\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Guy&#39;s\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do not give in to these demons that are trying to make a buck from the research we love \nand the equipment we use.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have given away including the shipping 5 RS boxes for free, 4, 470&#39;s and 1 469 all \nhacked by me.\n&gt; I did not do it to gain popularity or even wanted a thank you. my sole motivation was to \nbring new people into the research and \n&gt; in turn change someones life and perpetuate the idea of strength in numbers, in this \ncase strength of communication.\n&gt;  \n&gt; To all new people on this board, do not patronise these wolves that prey on the needs \nand wants of others. \n&gt; The RS 20 -125 is everything the 470 & 469 are and a little more. do not let the size or \ncomplicated button arrangement scare you off.\n&gt; the hack is as simple as the others. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Do not buy any RS hacks from ebay, they are sold with the wrong energy attached to \nthem, spirit wise.\n&gt; That is why I and all other researchers should follow the example of a great man to \nwhom we owe all of this research.\n&gt; Mr. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to make a substantial amount of \nmoney from his boxes and\n&gt; was offered the opportunity on a silver platter. But chose to follow what had been asked \nof him by higher entities.\n&gt; And that was to keep the research pure for research sake. And that at no time was this \nequipment or knowledge there of\n&gt; to be for monetary gain.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I adhere to this promise made by Frank to our friends on the other side and feel that \nthere is no need to give in to these box \n&gt; extortionists. If a box is not attainable for a new person yet, the right way. Then it \nprobably is not their time yet.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have coined a phrase and believe in it. &quot;The researcher does not choose the box, the \nbox chooses the researcher&quot;\n&gt; Be patient, those that do not yet have a box.

Well, all I can say is the \nmarket is driven by BUYERS. If people are willing to pay, you can&#39;t fault the person selling \nfor taking advantage of what the market will bear.
