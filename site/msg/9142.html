However.....<WBR>..<BR>> <BR>> On the flip side, just because someone is in spirit, does not mean <BR>that they are <BR>> automatically omniscient, nor that they have the right to impose <BR>their will (or you impose <BR>> your will, for that matter) on a loved one who may not be open to <BR>the communication <BR>> emotionally or spiritually. <BR>> <BR>> Assuming we are (as many indications have it) pretty much the same <BR>person in spirit that <BR>> we were here in the physical (our personalities remain fairly in <BR>tact, though just as here, <BR>> there can be growth and change on the other side), it would not be <BR>out of the realm of <BR>> possibility for them to tell you their loved one is open to <BR>communication, when in fact they <BR>> might not be.<BR>> <BR>> I guess my bottom
 line is this: There are so many people out <BR>there who are open to the <BR>> idea of EVP communication and are seeking to make contact with <BR>their departed loved <BR>> ones, that there is no need for approaching strangers with <BR>messages. The potential for <BR>> harm is just too great, and it is not our place (or the place of <BR>the person in spirit) to make <BR>> these kind of decisions for others. If this is what interests you <BR>(helping those in spirit to <BR>> pass messages along), then seek to make connections with people in <BR>the physical who are <BR>> openly and willingly on board your assistance. <BR>> <BR>> Margaret<BR>> <BR>> >>>Margaret and other colleagues on this forum, if a proven <BR>process can be initiated, the <BR>> information captured very clearly, and not faint, and it has to be <BR>clear that anyone <BR>> listening will hear the words, and if the spirit can confirm the <BR>info we have before
 them to <BR>> be accurate, and if the spirit can assure us that their loved one <BR>will not be offended, then <BR>> would it be ok for us to proceed?

 <BR>> that is), and a voice picked up on my recording gave me your name, <BR>and go from there. <BR>> > <BR>> > Thinking out loud here, I would think that the sprit would <BR>know if their loved one <BR>> would be in acceptance to me contacting them. <BR>> > <BR>> > I am documenting everything step by step, and I do plan to <BR>attempt contact if I have <BR>> the right info.
