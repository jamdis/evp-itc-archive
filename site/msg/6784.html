Hi All;

In my own work, I get some really amazing stuff in the  recordings. 
Voices that seemingly talk as if live from a pre-recorded  tape, they 
comment on what's happening around me at that moment. I get  very 
frustrated when not one box user will just let the things work,  
instead it's always ask questions, and pre-judge everything. I think  
we influance what comes through more than anyone here wants to  
believe. 

Then to have people that don't know squat about how the  box works, 
or anything about electronics presume to tell me how it really  works--
well, I can only take just so much of that without ripping  someone's 
head off. 

All these years on varous groups and forums,  and it's one arguement 
after another from those that want the paranormal  to behave according 
to some preconceived rules. I have a completely  different approach to 
this stuff, and if it's wrong--how come it  works?

As far as getting proof--I don't need it, I see, hear, and feel  
spirits from time to time, I know life goes on.

I have no idea what  I'm trying to say here. I don't want that 
argumentative, this is the  onlyest way crap stuff anymore. My boxes 
were not the first, or the best,  it just one more method of many. 
When someone says such and such is the  only way, I want to jump down 
their throat cuz that's wrong. Can't seem to  keep that grumpy old man 
locked in the basement!

Frank
