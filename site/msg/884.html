fooling around with thunder:

we&#x27;re getting those drenching t-storms with the low lightning between 
the trees , typical of jupiter passing between earth and galactic 
center so april 6 should be best evp time in awhile

tonite:


heated anode gold whisker end with one match .  in live circuit tuned 
to strong local station.
 
when match was two thirds burned, white noise started. match was put 
out. 
 
now there is a steady 20mv* across input with diode in place.  
previously 0 mv.  no difference when diode is reversed..  diode 
removed, v drops to zero.  formerly strong local station was barely 
audible with good audio amp.  now it is  at normal listening volume.  
diode is noisy, but beneath what you can hear when tuned to 
station.  &quot;lumpy&quot; white noise; white noise with larger scale order 
appearing and vanishing- unpredictably , like candle flame- but 
averaging about 3-15 times per second
 
other am receivers still full of crashing static from long gone t-
storm.
 
tank circuit +diode + audio amp= no lightning crashes whatsoever.  no 
line noise. no fluorescent light 60hz buzz.

im making som noise sources as soon as i collapse for awhile by 
holding a soldering iron to either end of  1n34 diode in live 
circuit.  injection of gold from point contact into germanium block 
forms defect type dopant and microscopic p or n+ later junction which 
has low back threshold and is very noisy but low amplitude.  noise 
that issues from an infinitely smal point source seems to work better 
for some reason.   i just hold a match or soldering on there while 
listening to amplified noise till i get something that sounds good

* 20mv average,  larger scale prigogine fluctuations up to 75mv.  
unpredictable but not completely random--pinked up due to SOMETHING 
UNIDENTIFIED trying to cohere. amplified 3-15 per second voltage 
peaks drive sweep.  random except for voice or other coherent energy.
