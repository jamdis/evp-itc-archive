I see TruTV also removed where it was stated Mr. Moon is the "sole" 
possesor of the Box. But still, it disses the person who brought this 
technology to the public, and that is Mr. Sumption. Thanks to thoses 
that contacted the network to set the record straight but the Edison 
connection is wishful thinking, and a distortion of statements made 
in the 1920's in Forbes followed by American Scientific magazine led 
to the assumption such a device was being worked on. He is the single 
quote by Edison that has resulted in a bit of history being 
twisted: "if we can evolve an instrument so delicate as to be 
affected by our personality as it survives in the next life, such an 
instrument, when made available, ought to record something."

can't offer it to you.

fact his work on what turned out to be the phonograph (capturing 
voices on wax cylinders, later on flat platters, later on what we 
call records) was intended to eventually lead to being able to record 
spirit voices. Apparently he got as far as figuring out how to record 
incarnate human voices <g>, but stopped before he got any spirit 
voices. I seem to dimly remember some comment that he thought his 
technology needed to be further developed, but he didn't pursue it, 
at least not in any way that has ever been publicly disclosed.
