It's a super simple site. Just five pages. But page one has a link to some of my EVP which I 
posted on putfile. And page two has several links: one for instructions on the water video 
ITC technique, one to a Maury segment on youtube where some of my material was used 
(thanks for posting that, Debbie!), and a couple collages of the crystal images.

I hope you like it.
