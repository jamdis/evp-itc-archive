so you can use any radio with a dial Frank?

 For those that don't know, it's simply tuning a radio across the band slowly while recording. I announce I'm doing an EVP recording, and start recording. You don't even have to do the tuning smoothly, or cover the whole band. The radio I'm using here takes multiple turns of the dial to cover the AM band.
 
 This method results in more consistent messages than what I get with the box, which is the same method, only automated.
