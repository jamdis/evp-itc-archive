Personality conflicts, egos,\naggression, all the not so nice aspects of human behavior really\naffect what happens in this field. Although I have two of Marks books\nI don&#39;t have Miracles but it sounds like it has some important lessons.\n\nEveryone has a belief system that affects their opinions of this\nresearch, but if people can&#39;t get past the petty conflicts then we\ncan&#39;t even continue collaborating to advance the connections we&#39;re\ntrying to establish that may exist outside the physical world. I am\ngrateful to most of the people in this forum but must admit I&#39;m glad\nthere was some recent housekeeping as it made it difficult to want to\nwork through all the post. \n\nRegarding Mark&#39;s work: for me it compliments the Box research. I&#39;ve\nhad some amazing solo journeys using nothing but a meditative mind and\nMark&#39;s Monroe Institute cd but the Box  seems to bring experimental\ncommunication research into a group environment that I haven&#39;t found\nelsewhere.  -Bill\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t worry Ann, there is nothing wrong with being a skeptic.

What a lot of people do not realize is that\nmost of these messages you receive are not for anyone other that the\none who receives them. They are personal! Mark and Rolf both shared a\ngreat deal of information with me as well as others. Mark has\npersonally told me he don&#39;t care who believes or doesn&#39;t believe the\nthings that happened then. Those experiences changed him for life and\nwill always will be help by him as truth.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the present moment Rolf, Dr. Senkowski and Hans are translating\nAdolf Holmes journals and writings into English. They are being posted\npiece by piece on the World ITC website. You may have not noticed\nbecause the changes have not been announced but they have been posting\nthem since last June. \n&gt; \n&gt; As for the validity of the events of the pioneers I have to give\nthem credence just from my own experiences since I began. I have had\nmany wonderful things happen while I have been experimenting with the\nmany methods and aspects of ITC.

The pioneers of this  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;field&quot; took in tens of thousands of messages and recordings through  \n&gt; \n&gt; a wide range of media.&lt;&lt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, they may have done, but how much of that was ever made public?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Not very much. Even today. I have gone through what has been  \n&gt; \n&gt; released, about six times over. Mark has let more out than just about  \n&gt; \n&gt; anyone. The key players, Maggie and Jules, have made very little of  \n&gt; \n&gt; theirs available indeed. I&#39;d love to see that change so that we can  \n&gt; \n&gt; better access what was going on.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; At the time INIT was together, I was rather desperately wanting and  \n&gt; \n&gt; asking for more information. When things began to be made public in  \n&gt; \n&gt; the United States, it was translated newsletters- -again anecdotal--no  \n&gt; \n&gt; attached files, obviously; photos that looked produced with 1980s  \n&gt; \n&gt; xerox technology (It *was* the 1980s, after all); a lot of second- \n&gt; \n&gt; hand stories and a a few first-hand ones passed from person to person  \n&gt; \n&gt; via letters and telephone conversations. Later, there was audio from  \n&gt; \n&gt; researchers like Sarah who let her phone messages from Raudive be  \n&gt; \n&gt; made public. As I noted, I don&#39;t have a problem with most of those.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Obviously, a voice was recorded on an answering machine and can still  \n&gt; \n&gt; be listened to today. I&#39;d prefer to think that voice really is  \n&gt; \n&gt; Raudive, but remember that it was not EVP--it was real phone calls.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When Macy wrote his book about it, Miracles in the Storm, I was  \n&gt; \n&gt; figuratively, if not literally, the the first person who bought it. I  \n&gt; \n&gt; thought, &quot;now I am finally going to find out what really happened and  \n&gt; \n&gt; be awed by the incredible evidence.&quot; Only Mark&#39;s book offered none of  \n&gt; \n&gt; that for me. I was just looking at the customer reviews for the book  \n&gt; \n&gt; on Amazon, because I thought I had written a review of it there at  \n&gt; \n&gt; the time. I didn&#39;t, but here is one from someone who pretty much sums  \n&gt; \n&gt; up what I think about it: &quot;Macy&#39;s book focuses mainly on the  \n&gt; \n&gt; personality conflicts that undermined an attempt at high-tech  \n&gt; \n&gt; communications with the spirit world. His style is readable and  \n&gt; \n&gt; brisk, his tone sincere and unaffected, but he provides little or no  \n&gt; \n&gt; evidence that the phenomena he describes are authentic. The main  \n&gt; \n&gt; researchers he depicts come off more as enthusiastic dilettantes than  \n&gt; \n&gt; serious scientists. For me, Macy forfeits nearly all credibility when  \n&gt; \n&gt; he casually declares that the history of the human race can be  \n&gt; \n&gt; understood by integrating some of the spirit communications with the  \n&gt; \n&gt; writings of Erich von Daniken (p.140)! Von Daniken, of CHARIOTS OF  \n&gt; \n&gt; THE GODS fame, is an entirely discredited huckster. If Macy can be  \n&gt; \n&gt; persuaded by von Daniken&#39;s pop-culture writings, he will probably  \n&gt; \n&gt; believe just about anything. There is an unfortunate messianic tone  \n&gt; \n&gt; pervading the book - the message that a new dawn of humanity is  \n&gt; \n&gt; coming, courtesy of the spirit communicators and the mortals who  \n&gt; \n&gt; spread their message. You&#39;ll probably find MIRACLES IN THE STORM  \n&gt; \n&gt; enjoyable and easy to read (hence three stars), but it will convince  \n&gt; \n&gt; no one who isn&#39;t already a believer.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I mentioned $cientology wryly, and I should have put in a ;) or  \n&gt; \n&gt; something--my bad--but I do stand by the similarity in message and  \n&gt; \n&gt; tone. I&#39;m not conflating the two, I&#39;m just pointing out what makes me  \n&gt; \n&gt; wary, and the sentence, &quot;our progress toward a free, wealthy and sane  \n&gt; \n&gt; future in which humanity would have stripped off the chains of  \n&gt; \n&gt; intolerance and cruelty&quot; is especially redolent.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In short, while I do believe that we all need to evolve into more  \n&gt; \n&gt; loving and spiritual beings, and I have tried all my life to do so  \n&gt; \n&gt; with a few limited successes, I still find that becoming &quot;better&quot; is  \n&gt; \n&gt; not tantamount to becoming less critical or buying into every  \n&gt; \n&gt; messiah&#39;s momentum. As I&#39;ve said before, I want to believe, but I  \n&gt; \n&gt; will not believe only because I want to. And I&#39;m not even saying that  \n&gt; \n&gt; the whole INIT thing was a fraud. It wasn&#39;t. But I do think that  \n&gt; \n&gt; there are aspects of it that were, or that were highly inflated. And  \n&gt; \n&gt; we have to be honest about that or we can&#39;t really be honest about  \n&gt; \n&gt; what is unshakable in paranormal research.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And this is just my own opinion, and we know what opinions are like,  \n&gt; \n&gt; and perhaps I am one. But I hope you will humor me and keep me around  \n&gt; \n&gt; because even one of those has its uses. ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your friend,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;!--\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-mkp{\n&gt; border:1px solid #d8d8d8;font-family:Arial;margin:14px\n0px;padding:0px 14px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mkp hr{\n&gt; border:1px solid #d8d8d8;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mkp #hd{\n&gt;\ncolor:#628c2a;font-size:85%;font-weight:bold;line-height:122%;margin:10px\n0px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mkp #ads{\n&gt; margin-bottom:10px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mkp .ad{\n&gt; padding:0 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mkp .ad a{\n&gt; color:#0000ff;text-decoration:none;}\n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;!--\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc{\n&gt; font-family:Arial;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc #hd{\n&gt; margin:10px 0px;font-weight:bold;font-size:78%;line-height:122%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc .ad{\n&gt; margin-bottom:10px;padding:0 0;}\n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;!--\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg {font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean,\nsans-serif;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg table {font-size:inherit;font:100%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg select, input, textarea {font:99% arial, helvetica,\nclean, sans-serif;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg pre, code {font:115% monospace;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg * {line-height:1.22em;}\n&gt; #ygrp-text{\n&gt; font-family:Georgia;\n&gt; }\n&gt; #ygrp-text p{\n&gt; margin:0 0 1em 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-tpmsgs{\n&gt; font-family:Arial;\n&gt; clear:both;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vitnav{\n&gt; padding-top:10px;font-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;margin:0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vitnav a{\n&gt; padding:0 1px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-actbar{\n&gt; clear:both;margin:25px\n0;white-space:nowrap;color:#666;text-align:right;}\n&gt; #ygrp-actbar .left{\n&gt; float:left;white-space:nowrap;}\n&gt; .bld{font-weight:bold;}\n&gt; #ygrp-grft{\n&gt; font-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;padding:15px 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-ft{\n&gt; font-family:verdana;font-size:77%;border-top:1px solid #666;\n&gt; padding:5px 0;\n&gt; }\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg #logo{\n&gt; padding-bottom:10px;}\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-vital{\n&gt; background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:2px 0 8px 8px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital #vithd{\n&gt;\nfont-size:77%;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;color:#333;text-transform:uppercase;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital ul{\n&gt; padding:0;margin:2px 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital ul li{\n&gt; list-style-type:none;clear:both;border:1px solid #e0ecee;\n&gt; }\n&gt; #ygrp-vital ul li .ct{\n&gt;\nfont-weight:bold;color:#ff7900;float:right;width:2em;text-align:right;padding-right:.5em;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital ul li .cat{\n&gt; font-weight:bold;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital a{\n&gt; text-decoration:none;}\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-vital a:hover{\n&gt; text-decoration:underline;}\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #hd{\n&gt; color:#999;font-size:77%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov{\n&gt; padding:6px 13px;background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov ul{\n&gt; padding:0 0 0 8px;margin:0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov li{\n&gt; list-style-type:square;padding:6px 0;font-size:77%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov li a{\n&gt; text-decoration:none;font-size:130%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #nc{\n&gt; background-color:#eee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:0 8px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad{\n&gt; padding:8px 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad #hd1{\n&gt;\nfont-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#628c2a;font-size:100%;line-height:122%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad a{\n&gt; text-decoration:none;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad a:hover{\n&gt; text-decoration:underline;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad p{\n&gt; margin:0;}\n&gt; o{font-size:0;}\n&gt; .MsoNormal{\n&gt; margin:0 0 0 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-text tt{\n&gt; font-size:120%;}\n&gt; blockquote{margin:0 0 0 4px;}\n&gt; .replbq{margin:4;}\n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;      \n____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Never miss a thing.
