<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wierd how some can hear, and some don&#x27;t, an dit&#x27;s not consistent.

I have my battery charger working now, so I can go back to the AM/FM board 
with random, and linear tuning modes. The systems seems to work better on 
batteries, that why I don&#x27;t use a bench power supply. I tried using AA 
battery packs, but the life was short, so now I use 12 volt gel cells. I had 
three 1.2 amp hour battteries, but I mounted them in #21, and it&#x27;s out it 
the world now, living it&#x27;s own life. Now I have some used 7 ah batteries. 
Current draw is only about 50mh per battery, so they should last hours, and 
hours. There&#x27;s just a little too much charge current for one charger, so I 
make a triple regulator board, but they all run from one bridge, and a 
single transfomrer. Then I use an old priniter switch, the ones they used to 
connect four computers to a single printer, and wire it so the batteries are 
seperated for charging, but join together to form the plus and minus 
supplies needed for the boards. I make it so the circuits don&#x27;t work while 
charging, just to elimiate hum pick up.
