Hi there, most of the spirit people that have spoke to me speak of God,  
Jesus, love, so, it they are demons saying, "i love you," or talking of the  
"love of God."  They must be very nice demons, one spirit told me that  
demons were "once great builders" and that "satan, aka Mr Horns, took their  
memory away, and made them forget they were great builders, and the jealous Mr  
Horns made them become what they are today." sf

They  seem to think that the voices are all demons or something. I don't 
know how to  explain it to them, I wish I could get them to understand. I am 
generally a  curious person so it was only a matter of time before I actually 
started with  this stuff.
