will chat soon!
 
Your work is inspiring to me.
 
You Hang In There!

Fellow researchers,

I have decided to back away from participating  in this group for a 
while. The constant clash of ego's and childish  bickering of which I 
have become a big part has begun to affect my  research in a negative 
way.
I have been advised to retreat from being  an active part of this 
group for an undetermined amount of time. I would  like to stay on the 
rolls as a member but will not actively participate as  far as posting 
results, files or opinions and advice.

I will  however be posting the results of my research on my box website
if there  are any of you who would like to hear them.

(http://free-paranormalinvestigating.com/franksboxjoesbox/) 

For  the new members, please do not let my comments on this matter 
affect your  opinion of this research. I have chosen not to 
participate here for  personal reasons. I will be devoting all my 
energy to advancing the  communication and technology.

If any new members feel they value my  advice please feel free to 
privately e-mail me _paranormalinvestigaparanormalinvpar_ 
(mailto:paranormalinvestigating@...) 

I  will be glad to help anyone but will not offer advice on any 
subjects  posted here.

Thank you to all the friends that I have managed to make  here you 
have been an immeasurable help.

Thank you
Bruce  Halliday
