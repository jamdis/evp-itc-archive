<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Don.  I started getting apparent intentional communication right away.  My first unit 
was the new 12-469 (which I&#x27;ve since stopped using because I can&#x27;t stand the click-click-
clicking).  I turned it on and the ears bud, which I was trying to place on my laptop near 
the built-in mic slid across the area.  Someone immediately said, &quot;Hey, watch it!&quot;  

I get a lot of sentences (I don&#x27;t mean after being pieced together, I&#x27;m getting multiple word 
responses grouped together in a single unedited sentence) and that helps to know it is 
intentional communication.  I think one word responses can be just as easily intentional.  If 
you ask for a name and get name, if you ask a yes/no question and get one of those 
words I think that counts as communication.  

The other week, I asked which of two cats foods they recommended and got a single word 
response that was the first ingredient (duck) of one of the foods.  I know that might sound 
like a silly question, but I&#x27;ve gotten to think of my communicators as friends so sometimes 
I ask things like this.  

I&#x27;ve not done any work with any type of echo chambers.  I find that playing the sound from 
the radio into the air, and recording via the built-in mic in my computer, keeps 
everything really simple (LOL - I like simple) and it allows me to catch some of what is 
being said real-time.

I think others on here are successfully using echo chambers and/or multiple radios so 
hopefully they&#x27;ll be able to give you more input.

I hope you start getting more responses soon.  Sometimes, too, it takes a bit of time for 
hearing to become accustomed to the unique sound of sweep and the less clear responses 
are not always as apparent.  The more practiced a person gets at working with sweep, the 
more that is caught while listening.  Just my thoughts on that.  Others may or may not 
agree.  :-)

&gt; I was wondering something,.  Actually 2 things.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) I have been trying mine for a week or so.  How long does it
&gt; take most of you before you get something?  I&#x27;ve gotten one word
&gt; things but they are subject to interpetation as to whether they were
&gt; real answers.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Testing echo boxes seems to make it better but does anyone
&gt; know the correct dimensions?  I could not find it anywhere.
