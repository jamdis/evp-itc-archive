This year for Christmas I bought my best  \nfriend&#39;s 12 yr old son an AM/FM radio kit from Edmund Scientific&#39;s web  \nsite. I offered to help him with soldering, since I did know that  \nwould be needed and I&#39;ve done stained glass in the past. Well, I&#39;m kid- \nsitting this weekend for him and his younger sister, and he brought  \nthe kit with him so we can get started. I didn&#39;t realize it was going  \nto be about a million teensy pieces that need to be assembled and ALL  \nsoldered into place, with explanations of why things are done and why  \nthey work. Very intimidating!\n\nButâ€¦ I now realize that when I&#39;m done with this project I will  \nunderstand a whole lot more about radio waves and how they work. Yet  \nanother interesting coincidence?

I met him about 3 years  \n&gt; ago. My husband is a commercial photographer and Mark asked him to  \n&gt; do his portrait for a book he was coming out with. He came to our  \n&gt; home studio for the portrait, and I got to talk with him a little  \n&gt; about what he does. At that time all I knew of EVP was from the  \n&gt; White Noise movie, wasn&#39;t sure it was real. But Mark was very nice,  \n&gt; passionate about ITC/EVP and very convincing. I wasn&#39;t quite sure  \n&gt; what to expect when I originally heard what he did, with all the  \n&gt; loonies out there claiming all kinds of stuff, but I got a really  \n&gt; good feeling from him and he&#39;s very, well, like I said, convincing.  \n&gt; After that I went to his web site and also bought one of his books,  \n&gt; which was a nice read.\n&gt;\n&gt; I went to the Stanley Hotel in November with a ghost hunting group  \n&gt; and Mark was a speaker there. I was really looking forward to his  \n&gt; lecture, but ended up with a wicked stomach virus and had to come  \n&gt; home early. I missed just about everything that weekend!\n&gt;\n&gt; Deb T\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Dec 29, 2007, at 9:51 AM, Ursula Bielski wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Oops! .  I forgot to answer: No, I have not given up ghost hunting  \n&gt;&gt; at all, but over the years I have come to focus more on the  \n&gt;&gt; collection and distribution of experiences than on encountering  \n&gt;&gt; phenomena myself.  ITC has really affirmed this for me.\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve felt all along that my job is to make people aware that  \n&gt;&gt; spiritual phenomena go on all the time in millions of lives; I&#39;m  \n&gt;&gt; not a scientist and I know nothing I do will change the way science  \n&gt;&gt; thinks.  BUT if I can open the minds of young people today, perhaps  \n&gt;&gt; our future scientists will make it their business to figure all  \n&gt;&gt; this out.\n&gt;&gt; I know this is a lot of what ITC experimenters are doing:  \n&gt;&gt; convincing others of the afterlife by their recorded evidence.   \n&gt;&gt; Amazing things can happen when THAT happens.\n&gt;&gt; Again, Mark Macy is so wonderful because he has dedicated his life  \n&gt;&gt; to this.  He and his colleagues have received such detailed  \n&gt;&gt; descriptions of how the afterlife works, that they have helped the  \n&gt;&gt; living change their lives to erase the fear of death--and to live  \n&gt;&gt; in a way that brings us to as high a spiritual level as possible  \n&gt;&gt; right away when our bodies die.  This means, for example, dealing  \n&gt;&gt; with issues and addictions, that plague us in life, since the  \n&gt;&gt; spirits tell us we take it all with us!  That is, death isn&#39;t a  \n&gt;&gt; cure-all.\n&gt;&gt; Any glimpse at the history of ITC shows us that all of this has  \n&gt;&gt; been gradually growing since the 19th century, when state-of-the- \n&gt;&gt; art graphite pencils and telegraphs were used to contact the dead.   \n&gt;&gt; Since then, there have been &quot;breakthroughs&quot; a number of times when  \n&gt;&gt; astounding floods of messages have come through.\n&gt;&gt; You experimenters are all so incredible--I&#39;m amazed every day at  \n&gt;&gt; your love, dedication and faith.  Surely something wonderful is  \n&gt;&gt; going to come from all this, and I think it&#39;s going to come during  \n&gt;&gt; our lifetimes.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ursula\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Robin Searcy Henson &lt;MudPuddleFarm@msn.! com&gt;&lt; /i&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Hello Bill,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I did steal that phrase from Ursula because I thought it  \n&gt;&gt; described what I was doing as compared to what I would like to be  \n&gt;&gt; doing!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I like what you said about focus on the equipment helping to  \n&gt;&gt; establish the psychic connection.

I see it was Ursula who posted the &quot;r vs. r&quot; statement. And\n&gt;&gt; Ursula your post is so much more eloquent and you&#39;ve articulated the\n&gt;&gt; point much better than I could. I&#39;ll bow out of your way -Bill\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@...! m, &quot; psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Robin,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Your phrase of &quot;ritualized vs. random&quot; is interesting. There are  \n&gt;&gt; many\n&gt;&gt; &gt; who believe that communication is between the conscious of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; researcher and the entity and the equipment is secondary. It&#39;s  \n&gt;&gt; easy to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; get swept up in the technology and forget there is possibly a  \n&gt;&gt; psychic\n&gt;&gt; &gt; connection going on. With that said, focusing on equipment actually\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can help the researcher become receptive to establishing a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; communication link. While paying attention to the equipment, we  \n&gt;&gt; forget\n&gt;&gt; &gt; about the daily distractions and minor irritations that may  \n&gt;&gt; prevent us\n&gt;&gt; &gt; from establishing contact.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The setting up the gear we use could be considered the first part  \n&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the &quot;ritual&quot;. I like to clear my mind, set up equipment, mess  \n&gt;&gt; with it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; some more, then I am mentally prepare to begin what I hope will  \n&gt;&gt; be a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; successful session.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I guess &quot;random&quot; recording to me would be what happens in the field\n&gt;&gt; &gt; during a paranormal investigation. I don&#39;t bring Box technology  \n&gt;&gt; into a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; location with the intention of possibly contacting lingering  \n&gt;&gt; spirits\n&gt;&gt; &gt; at that location but I do bring audio recorders in hopes of  \n&gt;&gt; recording\n&gt;&gt; &gt; evp&#39;s.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I find the Box works perhaps even better when I&#39;m in a familiar  \n&gt;&gt; place\n&gt;&gt; &gt; like the room in my home that is designated for that purpose. I do\n&gt;&gt; &gt; desire to have the finest Box technology that is possible but more\n&gt;&gt; &gt; important is the association that seems to occur between the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; researcher and the Box that is favored. Despite some of the  \n&gt;&gt; benefits\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of the new gear, the one that I seem to have a connection with is  \n&gt;&gt; one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that requires a little more finesse to operate. -Bill\n&gt;&gt; &g! t;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robin Henson&quot; &lt;MudPuddleFarm@&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, thanks for your help guys!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ursula, your post was lovely.

I basically follow your suggestion when recording,  \n&gt;&gt; and once\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I learned to be quiet I actually started getting responses. I  \n&gt;&gt; think\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the entities at my house got tired of playing with me though,  \n&gt;&gt; and now\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; they aren&#39;t saying anything.

I haven&#39;t been too active in the realm of EVP recording\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recently, but have had what I consider excellent results in  \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; past\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 PC.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using. I  \n&gt;&gt; know a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little about using good headphones and denoiser programs, but\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; beyond\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I&#39;m electronically challenged. Still, I wonder if  \n&gt;&gt; there are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple techniques I can experiment with to increase my  \n&gt;&gt; success. I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think I&#39;m a little bored.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#39;ve been communicating with  \n&gt;&gt; a very\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small number of entities, and I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s due  \n&gt;&gt; to the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs have  \n&gt;&gt; always\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; been\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside on the  \n&gt;&gt; hill and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near the barn. I&#39;ve gotten two inside my house (after  \n&gt;&gt; inviting\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; messages.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;m thinking about getting another DVR and would  \n&gt;&gt; love to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hear\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are  \n&gt;&gt; best. I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; would\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities eventually,  \n&gt;&gt; but\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunately don&#39;t have the brain for building anything  \n&gt;&gt; myself.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robin\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &g! t; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
