I have not done an investigation yet, I went to one \n&gt; of Chris Moon&#39;s GHUs to observe once, and went to the Stanley to see \n&gt; the new Mini box, but not to investigate. Not only that, I don&#39;t ask \n&gt; questions (or rarely ask questions), nor ask for any certain \n&gt; individuals. I used to protection stuff, particuallt Native Amnerican \n&gt; type pipe ceramony, but they convinced me to stop smoking, and I \nwon&#39;t \n&gt; even touch the pipe for fear of the tabaco hook. So I just don&#39;t do \nany \n&gt; of that stuff, and it doesn&#39;t seem to matter. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
