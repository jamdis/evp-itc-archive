&gt; Hello Tammi,
&gt; 
&gt; I am very sorry this has happened to you and your family.  I pray 
for 
&gt; the safe return of her, but if that is not possible I hope for a 
&gt; recovery so there is closure.
&gt; I also hope someone in our group is able to help locate an area to 
&gt; search.  I&#x27;m sure there are some in the group who are already 
working 
&gt; on your request.
&gt; We have many here who have been very successful at contacting those 
&gt; who may be able to help, using the numerous devices available.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m sure those involved will contact you if an answer is found.
&gt; Again, I pray for things to work out, you are in all our prayers.
&gt;
