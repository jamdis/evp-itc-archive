A little girl gives me a DATE of the year that is important to her. She says &quot;1927&quot; You will need headphones here people. I enhanced.....mainly so you can begin to hear where she will begin to speak. Is not much improvement over the original audio, but serves as a &quot;marker&quot; notification when the background audio gets quiter. She sounds so sweet :) I hope we become friends. The file is in my folder &quot;Jim&#39;s RR-DR60 EVP&#39;s&quot; the audio is called &quot;important_date_enhanced_evp&quot;. The reason I asked for an important date is so I could PROVE that I wasn&#39;t just getting some random interferance, or a &quot;natural&quot; spectral recording (the recordings left around locations associated with intense emotions) I wish I had a way of doing these conversations LIVE. Well at least close enough that they wouldn&#39;t get bored waiting for me to answer back. This is frustrating :) Don&#39;t want to just ramble on here folks. But this is just awsome!!"}
