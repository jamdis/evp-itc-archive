I&#39;m not sure if you have listened\ntoknown recordings of her voice, but some of the responses even\nsoundlike her! I listened to her at length in Atlanta, then had a 45\nminuteconversation with her afterwards and she had a distinctive voice\nIfeel I&#39;m recognizing here. -Bill--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,\n&quot;bhali333&quot;&lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; hey everyone,&gt; &gt; I had a\nreally terrific session recently and posted a bunch of files.
