Rhonda,

I'm so sorry to hear of your Mother passing. I try to be as loving=
 and harmonious a person possible, but if my sister did that to me I would =
not be a happy camper with her. 

Happy Belated Birthday!

I got married on=
 my 40th birthday. So it's impossible for me to ever forget my anniversary.=
 LOL. The only bad thing is my idea of a good birthday out (baseball game, =
etc.) is quite different from my wife's. LOL.

Have a great weekend.

Jerem=

Hey Jeremy,

Thanks for sharing your experience with me and everyone and Im=
 sorry for your loss....its tough to lose anyone let alone someone you are =
close to and unexpectedly.  

Something else I remembered.....I just lost m=
y mom this past Feb and because of my sister being selfish and keeping her =
nursing home a secret from me I hadnt gotten a chance to see her before she=
 passed...but I have this email addy I rarely check, its one I mostly use i=
f Im sending away for freebies...but something told me, nagged at me, to ch=
eck THAT email on the 21st....so I did.  I had gotten an email from my sist=
er letting me know that mom had passed and that I was "more than welcome" t=
o attend her funeral which was a few days later.....I could have missed tha=
t but someone wanted me to know...someone nagged at me to check my email...=
.I hadnt checked it in months so there were hundreds of spam emails but the=
 one from my sister was right there on the first page.(That by the way is m=
y Ruckus email....and if you have gotten a chance to listen to my recording=
s so far one of them has one of our spirit friends calling my nick name, "R=
uckus" in it.)

Anyways I thought Id share that with ya'll too.
Hope everyo=
ne is having a great weekend...going ok here so far...my b/f is making my b=
irthday dinner tonight even tho its a couple days late....I cant wait to bi=
te into a juicy steak and some sauteed mushrooms...mmmmmm!

  Hello Rhonda and Everyone,

  I have heard =
my name called out loud before, but it was not an EVP situation it was afte=
r my first girlfriend died. I was 17. She was 15. She had had her second ki=
dney transplant a few months earlier and died of gas gangrene.

  She died =
at 3:15 PM and I felt it. I knew that she had died. It is very difficult to=
 explain, but I knew that she was gone. So, it wasn't surprising to me when=
 I got home from school and my eldest sister was on the phone telling my Mo=
ther that Rena had died.

  My Mother had moved us to Texas from Oklahoma a=
 few months earlier. I knew that Rena wasn't doing good as she was before I=
 left, but no one expected her to die. She made a turn for the worse late t=
hat morning and by 3:15 she was gone. 

  Late that afternoon I took the Gr=
eyhound bus back to my hometown in Oklahoma. When I got to my sisters house=
, it was around 1 am. My sister is 18 years older than me, so I have a niec=
e that is a year younger than me. My niece and I both heard Rena call my na=
me and I then heard her call my name again a little later before I went to =
bed. That night after I had gone to sleep, it woke me up as I felt someone =
sit on the side of my bed. I knew it was Rena telling me she was okay, but =
this was before I knew anything about the paranormal, so I was a bit scared=
 to open my eyes and see her. 

  She was my first love and I am hoping tha=
t I will hear from her someday via EVP/ITC.

  I consider myself very bless=
ed to of heard her call my name and sit beside me to let me know she was ok=
ay. 

  Wishing everyone a wonderful weekend.
