Seems every time I come back on to leave a message\n&gt; there&#39;s some bickering going on. I can&#39;t leave you people for a minute\n&gt; without some hoopla going on LOL (just Kidding). Well how ya&#39;ll doing ?\n\nThere seemed to be something happening all around over the last few days \nor week.  It wasn&#39;t just here.  I am on 62 Yahoogroups and almost all of \nthem broke out in arguing and bickering at the same time. I have NEVER \nseen that happen! And one of my favorite area bands had some really \nbizarre and unpleasant things happen at a show on Saturday night. And we \nhad three earthquakes here. Some thought all of these events were caused \nby the full moon.  I dunno, it was still very odd but seems to have passed \nnow. Lives are retue=rning to normal.\n\n&gt; Fine I hope. I have been busy with my Paranormal Group and\n&gt; investigations and Gettysburg. I was in Gettysburg over this past\n&gt; weekend and got an EVP in the Triagular Field that said &quot; Never trust\n&gt; Abe Lincoln &quot; LOL must have been a Rebel soldier. I thought that was\n&gt; pretty cool.\n\nIt also could&#39;ve been a Union soldier who didn&#39;t like his outcome!\n\nI really want to get the chance to visit Gettysburg.  I am pretty sure \nBatleground, Indiana (the site of the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811) is \nhaunted by some of the former soldiers.  I&#39;ve been to that one many times \nbut never tried to get any EVP there.\n\nZack"}
