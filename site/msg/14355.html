  Oops, I might have got=

 the "file" button at to left corner oif program. There you would SAVE "sel=

  troubles sometimes. I was direction the use of filters to the RS tape=

  enough" to clean it up...no more. I guess with my headphone choice,=

  <BR>> M-Kay, for the same reasons I was drawn to Au=

  Goldwave a few times. But couldn't remember the fea=

  higher or lower) that helps bring it =
out of the "muddy" static level. As far 
  as using the "noise eliminator" =
be careful here...a little goes a long way. It 
  will make you audio sound=

 Has option to slow the recording down. Another nice 
  feature is that you=
 can use either a highpass or lowpass filter (sometimes 
  that is all that=
 is needed) and changing the PITCH is a very handy tool. 
  Always KEEP an =
original copy of your recordings. I just save a copy from 
  inside audacit=
y (to desktop or somewhere) then I will start my work on trying 
  to clear=
 it up. Save the original (and proceeding enhanced version(s) by using 
  t=
he "file" button at to left corner oif program. There you would SAVE 
  "se=
lection" as MP3.(To upload to here) or save to WAV (is bigger) but higher 
=
  qulity. Can always convert the wav to mp3 from withing audacity also. *yo=
u 
  will need to get the mps "pluging" from the website, and follow the 
 =
 information to install it "manually" (once is only needed) that way you ge=
t 
  the mp3 converter program free. But really...Audacity is a pretty good=
 program 
  to have round. Has a nice "undo" fesature too, if you make a mi=
stake. Happy
