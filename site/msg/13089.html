<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Louis,

Yes, that&#x27;s me.  I wanted to provide people with some free ideas on 
some of the different ways to use some of the devices, and it grew 
from there.  Some of the videos get a few more thousand views than 
the others.
My next free video on Youtube will be my mini-documentary about 
attempting to contact the plane crash victims from a certain crash, 
using debris from that crash, and sessions at the crash scene.
I&#x27;ve already sent out debris packages to some researchers who are 
going to help. I start filming that one in two weeks. 

I&#x27;ve listened to your internet radio program a few times.  Good stuff!

Have a great day,
- Mike C. (UFO Geek)

&gt; Took me a couple of emails but I realized on your signature at the 
bottom of one of your recent posts that it was you... Can I just 
shake your hand dude? Your post about Radio Shack boxes and the 
uses... I like how you record in real time by the way using multiple 
radio shack boxes... (must be a pain in the butt to review)... 
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. I find the Radio Shack and Franks Box sessions in general to 
be really chaotic and I find that I can only do the sessions in 
increments of 5minutes...It drives my team batty hehe... but I 
really like some of the results... Also, I tend to stay on AM band as 
FM generally is music and I mostly record the group Coldplay hehe...
