I have recently \nbeen made aware that there are several replica versions of this \ndevice being sold. I have also been told of another device that can \nbe purchased for very little from any electronics merchant and \naltered by hand, producing what some consider to be results. As I \nexpected, the samples that people have sent me are nothing more than \ntimed radio scans that have no validity. \n\nWhat is important to remember, before purchasing any of these replica \ndevices, is that the Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides on the \nother side have repeatedly explained that the way that the Telephone \nto the Dead technology works, is by spirit energy manipulating the \nrandom voltage generator (RVG) and using white and pink noise, as \nwell as radio fragment, to create real time voice answers to \nquestions posed from our side. The most important aspect to this \ndevice is the medium operator who works as an antenna \nor &quot;interpreter&quot; for living individuals asking the questions. \n\nThomas Edison, in an intelligent spiritual discussion through the \nTelephone to the Dead, stated that there were only thirty of these \nindividuals that could effectively use the device. Four have been \nidentified to this point. \n\nI have spent nearly four years testing and doing paranormal research \nwith the Telephone to the Dead, and I have built strong relationships \nwith Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides who I trust, and who trust \nme. These new &quot;radio scanners&quot; are not only a waste of money for \npeople looking to do research with them in hopes of having effective \ncommunication with the other side, but may in fact be very dangerous. \nShould demonic and other negative entities learn to use these false \ndevices, the results could be devastating. Though I rarely see eye to \neye with the Catholic Church on the matter of using the Telephone to \nthe Dead, I do admit that they predicted the widespread sale of false \ncommunication devices as far back as last year. I have recently begun \nto receive requests from individuals asking for help to close \nnegative doorways and portals that they believe they opened using \ntheir purchased Telephone to the Dead replica. Others are claiming \nthat I am a fraud because their purchased device doesn&#39;t produce the \npositive results I have been fortunate enough to have, and claim that \ntherefore, all of my results MUST be false. \n\nI can see this spiraling out of control already. Once again, I will \ncontinue my research with the actual Telephone to the Dead as well as \nprovide public demonstrations and private readings for those truly \ninterested in real time spirit communication. Please feel free to \ncontact me with any questions at\n\nBruce\n\n\n\n                         \n\r\n--0-1832479224-1196349538=:17671\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Well, just sit your &quot;moon&quot; down on the seat and deliver some more...!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Rod&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE class=replbq style=&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid&quot;&gt;  &lt;DIV id=ygrp-text&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Here is a blog steve sent me from moons myspace page as usual he&#39;s in &lt;BR&gt;a panic because his fraudulent buisness is going down the tubes. he &lt;BR&gt;claims to know the only way box communication can be achieved but who &lt;BR&gt;would know better than the box inventor.
