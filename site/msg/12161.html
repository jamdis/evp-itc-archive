<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sorry so late chiming in again, but just wanted to toss in that these
A/D  speech boxes really seem to be an interesting new front to ITC.
In my opinion, it seems to take out some of the coincidence factor,
and when using phoneme mode, you are basically guaranteed (it would
seem) against false positive multi-syllable words. If you get one,
seems more likely to be genuine. Also, with the puck&#x27;s ability to log
a session, seems like it would eliminate the &quot;what was thay saying?&quot;
factor as well.

I saw someone mentioned that these devices would not be taken
seriously by researchers. I am dealing with that now with my
collagues, who are tripping over themselves to dissassociate from me
since I started experimenting with box-type ITC communications. If it
is ITC and there is another piece of equipment involved for
communication, a lot of people just won&#x27;t have it. EVP recorded in
traditional fashion is the only type they will accept (even if the
mechanism involved is as much a mystery as box type communication)and
anyone dealing with a frank&#x27;s box or derivative is just experimenting
with matrixing and coincidence. I used to think that until I decided
to try one, but I cannot get my associates to be that open minded.
Shame really, because something is going on, even if we aren&#x27;t sure
what. Let&#x27;s face it, box communication is a skeptic and debunker&#x27;s
playground, and until we understand it, we have little to defend with
with exception of sometimes perfectly accurate and contextual data.
Usually not good enough for them though, so this becomes a personal
leap of faith to those who wish to study and experiment with it. Had I
not had a stellar first run with box type ITC, I would have likely poo
pooed the idea and shelved it for good.

Guess the point I am trying to make above is that these devices, be it
box, or ovilus/puck may never be accepted by the hardcore research
proponents and that is something we just have to accept. I thank God I
found Frank&#x27;s forum here where people are not going to laugh at you
for mentioning ITC. Make no mistake, I am dealing with a lot of peer
problems with my research group over my interest in this, but I don&#x27;t
care. It is funny that they conside psychic impressions as correlative
evidence if it coincides with other forms of data that occurs
simultaneously with the impression. If that is enough to give
validation, I don&#x27;t see why this is any different, but hey, I can&#x27;t
convince them, lol. I see I am straying off topic again, but another
thing I wanted voice support for is the puck. Man I love this thing, I
think that it truly brings us closer to understanding the mechanism
involved with this type of ITC. The environmental sensors coupled with
the logging ability should show patterns over long periods of use, and
the operator should start seeing when environmental conditions are
more favorable for good communication. And, if touted as an
environmental array, it has great uses as such in the mainstream
traditional form of investigation. Who knows, a successful ITC session
with the puck would bring more people into experimentation.

thanks, 
Andy

&gt; Was jus wondering what you all thought of the Ovilus and the puck? I 
&gt; was really thinking of buying one and was jus looking for feed back or 
&gt; a tip on something better..
