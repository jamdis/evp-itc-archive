Yes, I have had that happen and would suggest that somebody was 
trying to get your attention, perhaps.  We seem to be more &quot;open&quot; to 
spirit communication during, before and after sleep.  The left brain 
calmes down and the right brain becomes un-suppressed and able 
to &quot;tune-in&quot; in my opinion.  ;)

&gt; Hi Christine, while I have yet to get a box, or have even figured 
out how to get one, may I ask you a question? On occasion at night I 
hear someone shouting my name &quot; Mike!&quot;  But that is it. I either hear 
the voice with my mind or my ear. Have yet to figure that out yet. 
You note that you can see spirits, but can you hear them?  I often 
wonder if this Jon Edwards guy or George Andersen are really speaking 
to spirits as they seem to be fishing in a reading, and if the 
customer pickis up on it, the reader says, &quot;yes that is what they are 
tellling me&quot;.  I would think if spirits spoke to you, that you would 
hear them as you would hear me speaking to you.  I am new at this 
stufff, and have much to learn.  Any comments about the above would 
be helpful.  Mike Edwards  Cary, NC
