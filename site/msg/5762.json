I really don&#39;t think that file says anything, you \nmay have overprocessed that file too much to begin with.  If you send \nme a raw recording clip of a question and answer, i will be more than \nhappy to go over it for you and than i will explain how i edited your \nfile so you can do the same in the future.  Box files don&#39;t need that \nmuch editing, i usually just ask a question and than cut out some of \nthe in between static leaving just the answer.  And you really don&#39;t \nneed to edit the answers that much because it&#39;s radio and clear \nalready.  Sometimes i just slow it down maybe 10% and that&#39;s it, and \nif it&#39;s an answer in a distance i will raise the volume on just that \nsection of the audio.  If you need any help, i&#39;m here.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt;   File        : /Eastern Paranormal/No not your name say Gabreael \nGABREAEL Isolated.mp3 \n&gt;   Uploaded by : eastern_paranormal &lt;eparanormal@...&gt; \n&gt;   Description : GB: Repeating My Name Back Isolated From Other \nAudio \n&gt; \n&gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Eastern%20Paranormal/No%\n20not%20your%20name%20say%20Gabreael%20GABREAEL%20Isolated.mp3 \n&gt; \n&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; \nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htm\nlfiles\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; eastern_paranormal &lt;eparanormal@...&gt;\n&gt;"}
