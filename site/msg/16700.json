There is so much information here it is hard to process all of it.  Currently, I am working on building a Frank&#39;s box for my paranormal group, however, I am looking for some other home made type equipment to have for our investigation this next week.   We currently have IR cameras, EMF detectors, tons of audio recorders and many different cameras.  Is there anything else we should have or be using that anyone can think of??\n&gt;"}
