It does show every dust orb there is, the picture quality =\r\nis a bit blurry or fuzzy many times. I was very disappointed.\n\nOne thing ab=\r\nout the SVP still camera is if you drop it, even once, you will have a brok=\r\nen SD card slot. I was sold one on Ebay from someone who knew the SD card w=\r\nas broken and never revealed it. Some research showed me what the possible =\r\nreason was...it cannot take a drop. So handle it with care. Their packing s=\r\nlip even says they will not warrant the camera against drops. But you proba=\r\nbly won&#39;t find that advertised on their web site though.\n\nI found it intere=\r\nsting and somewhat amusing that Ghost Hunters on tv showed up with this equ=\r\nipment in their series. However the Moditronics label was ripped off, the g=\r\nlue was still on the camera and there was a zoom in to this portion of one =\r\nof the cameras.\n\nIn regards to the spectercams, in this economy and with th=\r\ne infrequency that I investigate, I cannot justify spending what any of the=\r\n spectercams go for. If I were going out to investigate every week or every=\r\n other week, then sure I could justify spending more money.
