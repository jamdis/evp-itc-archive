Thanks April. I also don't understand the vehemence of the comments to me.=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 All I can figure, is that some people here have had their deep=
ly held beliefs attacked previously by those calling themselves or acting l=
ike skeptics or scientists.=C2=A0 They compare me to them, and so connect m=
y tests and questions as heralding more attacks on their beliefs.

I don't =
in the least condone attacking people's beliefs, much less attacking them p=
ersonally (as unfortunately people here are attacking me now).

Is it because I don't believe everything you do? I don't attack you becaus=

So why do you feel it necessary to attack me?
