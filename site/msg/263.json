I have NEVER looked in my entire life at \nany of my photos for orbs etc. I finally pulled out a few CD&#39;s of film \nand its amazing i never saw what is on these pictures. There are orbs on \nalot of them, there is series of pictures that have HUGE STREAM of \nlight, but in the last one its NOT there. Is it just the sun or other? \nConsidering that the ray is blinding in the other photos. Another AMAZING \naspect, is this &quot;streak&quot; its grey and running a couple inches.
