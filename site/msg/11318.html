Hi Clara-
  im Charm, and im one of the "newer'"  members to this group.... As for what methods to use, many others here have been doing itc longer than I have ( 3 or 4years)
  i personally use a manual sweep method... many others here use this method- or an auto sweep ( after hacking an am/fm radio)
  others still use 'ghost boxes' and again- many have excellent results with all these methods..... there are many radios and cool gadgets to use ( like franks box, ovilus, joes box) etc etc.... but i use a trashed old radio that was in my garage and i still get good results.... so in my opinion, it doesnt really matter which you use.....
  but im sure Steve, Bruce, Kay and Margaret can give you advice on where to start...
  good luck, and welcome to our little corner of the spookworld...
  :)

          Hello everyone,

I am Clara and I live in Central California. I have been a paranormal
investigator since 2006 and I have been very fortunate to record many
messages with digital and analog voice recorders.

Within my investigative groups, I have always been the EVP tech. I
have discovered that there are many more angles to EVP than just
straight recording.

I joined your group to learn more and boy I have been so fascinated
with all the talk among you all with your equipment.

How should I start? Who can give me some good advice on what I should
try next? I am not gifted to be able to build things, maybe unless
they are very easy.

I would travel (with time to plan it) if I was able to learn more
about other methods for capturing evp.

Thank you for your time to read my message and hopefully you can help me.
