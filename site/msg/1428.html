<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was pulling two cables under one of the schools this afternoon. I had them 
stretched out about 100feet, I went back to pull a little more , and here&#x27;s 
this strip if plastic tied around each of the cables, not just tangled, 
neatly tied, and I know for fact that I was the only one down there. Both 
sides were tied in two half hitches, I would think that would be impossible 
to happen by chance. I told &quot;them&quot; that was a good joke!
