&gt; LC,
&gt;  
&gt; We all know that most of the paranormal community, given the 
opportunity would choose 
&gt; a cheesy tv sci fi ghostie show complete with mirrors, bed sheets 
and scary sound effects.
&gt; over legitimate selfless paranormal research purely for research&#x27;s 
sake.
&gt;  
&gt; But if it were not for these type of shows what would all the self 
proclaimed psychic mediums
&gt; and paranormal experts do? crossword puzzles. Don&#x27;t you realise 
that it is shows like this and taps that
&gt; have shown that anyone that can afford an emf detector, voice 
recorder and camcorder with nightshot
&gt; and a brand new shinny silver case to carry it all in, can start a 
paranormal investigating society and
&gt; pay their entry fee to get into places like eastern state penn. and 
collect &quot;REAL&quot; paranormal evidence.
&gt;  
&gt; maybe we should try that and stop killing ourselves doing real 
research and trying to gather legitimate evidence.
&gt;  
&gt; come on you guy&#x27;s knew I had to throw my 2 cents in!

&gt; I just got to add to FS&#x27; point with respect to Paranormal State. 
Anyone notice Ron Milione (TAPS gadget electronics expert) appeared 
on Paranormal State as now a &quot;demon expert,&quot; identifying an EVP on 
the show as a &quot;demon&quot; by the sound of its voice on the recording?Then 
I saw Ron on the History Channel&#x27;s UFO Hunters as a UFO 
researcher/expert. I&#x27;m trying to keep count, but that makes him a 
electronics guru, UFO expert and demonologist! Nice guy, but I think 
he just has a great agent that can get him these &quot;roles.&quot; Also, I saw 
a lady have her home investigated by the Penn State bunch on 
Paranormal State and supposedly in need of their help, then I turn 
the channel and see her as a paranormal investigator on Ghost Hunters 
International! She must have a great agent, too. ;)LC --- In EVP-

the risk of being negative yet again, all I can say is --You have got 
to be friggin&#x27; kidding!? No wonder all the &#x27;serious researchers&#x27; call 
it entertainment, cuz shows like that put this work back with Barnum 
and Baily! I think they take urban myths, like the haunted piano, and 
do a show on it, with all actors. Their demonolgist supposedly worked 
on the Amityville case, ya mean the Hollywood version, cuz the real 
case was nothin!? Just watch the people involved, and you can tell 
they are actors, with speech training, not a single um, ah, or 
stutter ever uttered! It&#x27;s all just too well rehearshed and scripted 
for me to watch any more of it. Some Googele results for &#x27;haunted
