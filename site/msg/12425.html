<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The first step should be to see if there are any sponsors 
interested.  That would take care of many of the $$$ issues.  I know 
there are some on this forum who have been involved in these type 
meetings.  I wonder if any of them would be willing to consider 
taking on this effort.

Don&#x27;t ask Radio Shack though... Their lawyers have already contacted 
me with one of those legal threats.

&gt; &gt; expenses such as meeting room, coffee, equipment rental, gas  
&gt; &gt; expenses for the coordinator etc. is not only appropirate but  
&gt; &gt; esential for a group meeting.  I also heartedly believe that a 
small  
&gt; &gt; fee for direct expenses is important for demonstrating 
appreciation  
&gt; &gt; of value on the part of participants.  If zero is paid, it&#x27;s too  
&gt; &gt; easy to say &quot;yes, I&#x27;m in&quot; and then never show.  The money is a  
&gt; &gt; token.  That&#x27;s been my experience.  But that&#x27;s just me.   ron
