Hi, guys--
  Glad to see everyone talking about the Luminator.  Absolutely the Luminator was not made for what Mark does with it, and he will be the first to tell you that.  The thing about it is: it's the same as what we do: if you're a total skeptic you can say: the results are wishful thinking.  But try telling that to those who've seen their loved ones in the Luminator photos
  There's some other cool stuff:  for all you Philadelphia Experiment folks, Mark writes about his buddy who had three Luminoators set up in his office at one time, leaned his head against the wall, and had his head go through the wall.  There's just something very physical going on--no games, no whatever--make what you like of it, bottom line is: it's got us talking, right?
  Happy New year, all,
  Urs

          As I said, Bill, I'm not sure what the effect of this device is on the camera and film. However, what I can tell you, as someone who has a lot of experience with photography, is that I have not yet seen a Luminator picture where the double looked significantly different from the model in such a way that it is clearly not the model. When and if I do, I will absolutely say so. But from what I have seen to date, I have to conclude these are not "spirits." I'd love them to be and if I thought they were, I'd be the first one in line to have my picture taken.

          Hi Ann,

I also thought that the subdued lighting or maybe camera movement was
causing the images to distort but on that SciFi show I mentioned in an
earlier post, they brought their own Polaroids and their own film and
got the same double image when the Luminator was turned on. I'm not
saying the images are the dead relatives of the person in the photo,
but something odd is happening. -Bill
