The \nbiggest question here is how much energy is going IN to the radio \nwave generator and that&#39;s easy to calculate (and, very conspicuously, \nnot mentioned in any article/video I&#39;ve found on this). If the energy \nin is greater than the energy out - there is no free lunch and the \nFirst Law of Thermodynamics continues to hold...\n\nAs for a cancer-fighting device...now that has potential. Of course, \nthere are questions there, too. Like: are the &quot;nano&quot; impurities ONLY \n(or signficantly) absorbed by cancerous tissue? If not, the process \nmay not be much more precise than manual cutting! And what exactly is \nthe mechanism of death for the cancer cells? If it&#39;s by localized \nheating - the body has to get rid of it and will the hot residue of \nthe dead cancer cells significantly transfer to surrounding healthy \ncells thus causing their death, too? Again - a scalpel could be \nalmost as effective, if so.\n\nAnyone have anything to post on EVP/ITC?\n\nGuy\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The same machine also holds promise for curing cancer. He will have \nthe drug and oil interests attention. I hope it can work in both \narenas of energy and health and won&#39;t be supressed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; --- kennnthomas2000@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Ken Thomas &lt;kennnthomas2000@...&gt;\n&gt; To: electrofusion &lt;electrofusion@yahoogroups.com&gt;,  evp-itc &lt;EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;,  bearden-energy &lt;bearden-energy@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Man Discovers Solution To Energy Crisis?\n&gt; Date: Sat, 9 Jun 2007 14:22:23 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.rense.com/general76/mand.htm\n&gt;    \n&gt;    \n&gt;    \n&gt;    \n&gt;   thats a sodium flame\n&gt;    \n&gt;   which means there an efficient production and recombination of \natomic hydrogen and atomic chlorine.  the recombination is so highly \nexothermic that more energy could be produced than is expended.  at \nthe expense of cooling the surroundings\n&gt;    \n&gt;    \n&gt;   in theory, this can be a free lunch - but well have to wait and \nsee\n&gt;"}
