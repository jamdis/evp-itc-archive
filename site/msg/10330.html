Hi Frank,
 
I know this is all stupid and some of us have really had enough of  it.  
Especially being called childish names and being swore at and  threatened.  But it 
hasn't stopped in private emails?
 
This is such the case.  And now it has come down to physical threats  because 
well maybe that's all these neanderthals know or can understand.   ANd yes it 
has been reported to the proper authorities but what do you recommend  be 
done about iy.
 
Your opinion would be greatly appreiated.
 
Jeff

Huh!? I can only say, I don't have to do this group thing either, I  
stay cuz a few request it. The guys actually talk more if I don't  
share. 

I can understand where Bruce was coming fom, to a point,  but when 
you start making threatening private e-mails to make sure  everyone 
agrees with you, that's just demented and wrong. This shit ain't  
that important!
