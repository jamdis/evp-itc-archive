<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ann,

Sure enough. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t bring up the bad stuff much, since 
it&#x27;s a miniscule amount of what&#x27;s generally reported on EVPs. 
Shamanically speaking, I&#x27;m very interested in Tulpas, so I&#x27;d love to 
hear your experience in greater depth.

A really wild turn of the screw recently happened after my group, 
DAPS, conducted an investigation at haunted house in Gainesville, 
Texas. The homeowner can&#x27;t keep renters in it, so she&#x27;s begun 
allowing paranormal investigators to come and check it out. We had 
quite a number of digital audio recorders running there, but what has 
us floored is the nature of what we picked up. 

The mindblowing aspects are as follows: First, that we got a huge 
number EVPs, more than any other location we&#x27;ve ever gone to before. 
And secondly, many of the EVPs, from various researcher&#x27;s recorders 
have the unmistakable sounds of people having sex. Moans, groans, and 
cussing, with whips and screams included!

I am not kidding around or exagerating. Out of respect, I&#x27;ll refrain 
from being explicit. Let me just say that if anyone wishes to verify 
the EVPs our investigator Jennifer captured, you&#x27;re welcome to 
download the Gainesville house.zip of her wavs - 
http://www.filecrunch.com/file/%7Ecmkvx0

I&#x27;m still working on getting my EVPs onto the PC and uploaded, but 
they&#x27;re part and parcel of the same carnal activities. After I aquire 
and synchronize myself with my MiniBox, I&#x27;m going back to see if 
anyone will give it a rest long enough to sing a few syllables... 
Yes, we recorded singing there as well.

I suppose the randy EVPs shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise since the place was  
formerly a notoriously rumored Speak Easy during prohibition.

Does all this fall into the catagory of too much information?!

LOL!

&gt; I had one of those moments myself, Lance, albeit at a slightly 
later  
&gt; age, but in my case, the Tulpa I was battling was my own creation.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m a journalist, so yes, I ask a lot of pointed questions. I am  
&gt; trying to bolster a point, however: spirit communication is more  
&gt; beneficial than detrimental. You ask a person how many wonderful  
&gt; things came of it and you readily get responses; you ask how many  
&gt; people have had bad ones and you get stories about other people&#x27;s  
&gt; problems, in the main.

&gt; &gt; Dear Ann,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Damn, you are a determined woman! ;-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Very well. If you must know, yes I&#x27;ve confronted darkness face to
&gt; &gt; face. What some would call evil... calling my name.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was but a small child at the time, looking through crib slats. 
Long
&gt; &gt; ago but never forgotten. Something I now know was a war for my 
soul
&gt; &gt; took place, as much as that is odd to relate. Pleasing terror 
yawned
&gt; &gt; wide, like sharp toothed jaws on one side, yet a light of infinite
&gt; &gt; power and truth, a lighthouse within, finally sent her away, along
&gt; &gt; with a simple decision I made, to embrace the highest and best.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That&#x27;s about as much as I wish to say, since many will not 
understand
&gt; &gt; let alone believe, until such a thing is revealed to them, as it 
was
&gt; &gt; to me. It is so difficult to put such forces from within and 
beyond
&gt; &gt; into words, and even harder to understand.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; LOL!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Suffice it to say I am a believer.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My quest in this life is to play a small part, a singular role, 
like
&gt; &gt; a tiny ripple in the vast sea.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Nothing more. Nothing less.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But again, Lance, I am talking about personal experiences, not
&gt; &gt; other
&gt; &gt; &gt; people&#x27;s alleged experiences. Have you ever been injured by a
&gt; &gt; &gt; negative entity? Or even scared shitless?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Ann,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just jumping in to add my two cents. I personally don&#x27;t like 
to
&gt; &gt; focus
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on evil entities, even though I believe 100% that lower 
astrals
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist. Not only that, Tibetan shamans, among others, have
&gt; &gt; repeatedly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shown that thought forms can be given form and a measure of 
life.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The way I see it, if we keep a higher focus, such things as 
rage,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hate, and destruction among other things will be far removed.
&gt; &gt; Ouija
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Boards have many times been the source of horrible 
experiences.
&gt; &gt; Just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from listening to all the hundreds of callers on C2C over the
&gt; &gt; years,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;d say over 95% of the stories weren&#x27;t good.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; George did make a good statement to the effect that it&#x27;s not 
good
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; giving a loaded gun to a child.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He may very well have changed it. Maybe he&#x27;ll tell us why
&gt; &gt; himself,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if he chooses, since he&#x27;s a list member.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can I ask you what personal experiences you have had with 
evil
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; entities that make you so concerned? Not other people&#x27;s 
alledged
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiences, but your own? I&#x27;m really curious. It&#x27;s not a 
trap of
&gt; &gt; any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kind.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Not misinformation. The page has been changed as of Dec 
3rd!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that. The article did indeed state that children and high
&gt; &gt; school
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;students would be part of the testing groups as well as
&gt; &gt; skeptic,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;believers, etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Yes I did notice the discrepancy between the asup article 
and
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;disclaimers on the paranormal sytems page.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I pulled this list of general recommendations for The
&gt; &gt; MiniBox
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; off Ron&#x27;s www.paranormalsystems.com page -
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1. Do not allow children under the age of 16 to use 
this
&gt; &gt; device
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2. Although individual sessions are effective, group
&gt; &gt; sessions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; productive.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3. This is not an &#x27;electronic Ouija board&#x27; - no harm 
can
&gt; &gt; come
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; using it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 4. Some voices will use coarse language so be prepared 
for
&gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 5. Always use a recorder to tape all sessions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 6. Keep a notebook with the times and locations of your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sessions.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 7. The MiniBox will call you by name so don&#x27;t be 
startled
&gt; &gt; by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.
