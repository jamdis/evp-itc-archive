But once the attachment is downloaded, the quality has be=\r\nen found to be less then the original wav.\n\nAgain though you can only reall=\r\ny tell when the wav file is large.\n\n----- Original Message ----- \n  From: R=\r\nj \n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, May 10, 2009 1:36 PM\n  Su=\r\nbject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n\n\n\n\n\n        The kind of compress=\r\nion that occurs during an email attachment is &quot;lossless&quot;: it compress the f=\r\nile cleverly without losing information.  For example, if I had a program i=\r\nn some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it could compress it.  But if =\r\nit lost even one bit, the resulting exe file would not execute again after =\r\nit was uncompressed on the other side.\n\n        This kind of compression do=\r\nes things like looking for common patterns in the file, and replacing them =\r\nwith a token.  A rough example would be if it found &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot; in a f=\r\nile 20 times, it could replace all the occurances with say $HN1.  And also =\r\nwrite a little dictionary in there someplace that says &quot;$HN1=3DHowdy Neighb=\r\nor&quot;.\n\n        When the file gets to its destination it can be uncompressed,=\r\n and all occurences of $HN1 are replaced with &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot;.  So it was =\r\ncompressed (instead of 14 characters each, it only needed 4, plus the dicti=\r\nonary), but lost no data.\n\n        Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not=\r\n lossless.  Depending on the level of compression, some level of data is lo=\r\nst, and so cannot be recovered or reconstructed later.\n\n        Rick\n\n\n\n   =\r\n     --- On Sun, 5/10/09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombieghostresearch=\r\n.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombieghostres=\r\nearch.com&gt;\n          Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n          =\r\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n          Date: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 10:26 AM\n=\r\n\n\n\n          Another thing:\n\n          I recently found this out. When you =\r\nemail a file, if it is not saved as a compressed format, the email filterin=\r\ng process will actually compress the file automatically.\n\n          So even=\r\n if you have attached a wav. file, it will loose resolution over the email =\r\nprocess. It will not sound exactly the same as the original wav. file. How =\r\nmuch it differs depends on the size of the file you are attaching. If it is=\r\n a very large file, it will sound much different.\n\n          The only excep=\r\ntion to this is if the wav. file is small enough that the filtering process=\r\n will ignore it. It has to be pretty small though, like under 1 MB (I am no=\r\nt exactly sure of the threshold).\n\n          The best way to share files ov=\r\ner the internet if you want them as close to the original as possible is to=\r\n upload them directly to a website.\n\n            ----- Original Message ---=\r\n-- \n            From: Rj \n            To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com \n       =\r\n     Sent: Sunday, May 10, 2009 10:54 AM\n            Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC]=\r\n File uploading rules\n\n\n\n                  Pixelization doesn&#39;t clean-up th=\r\ne data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a picture of a field of flowers, an=\r\nd beginning to add levels or pixelization to the picture.  Soon, you would =\r\nnot be able to tell there were flowers there at all.  You would see a lot o=\r\nf colored blocks.\n\n                  Or in the other direction, imagine you=\r\n are looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on your screen: a comp=\r\nlete screen of truely random static snow.  Pixelizing this, after a while, =\r\nyou would again start to see colored blocks.\n\n                  What&#39;s happ=\r\nening is that it is processing an area of the image, taking (for instance) =\r\nthe average value of that entire area, and replacing all the blocks in that=\r\n area with the average.  In video processing, this would result in a field =\r\nof multi-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-blu=\r\nish block, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise example, it maybe =\r\nreplace all the random pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.  If yo=\r\nu did not know beforehand what the original picture was, you couldn&#39;t tell =\r\nwhether your pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, the sk=\r\ny with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.\n\n                  It works the=\r\n same with the sound files.  Taking something as complex as speech, and rep=\r\nlacing frequencies with their averages, loses the speech the farther you go=\r\n, until you head strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the same to rando=\r\nm static will eventually produce the same thing.  And random fluctuating sq=\r\nuare waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, you could have fun sh=\r\naring with each other what you thing they &#39;sound like&#39;.\n\n\n\n\n\n              =\r\n    --- On Sun, 5/10/09, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n     =\r\n               From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt;\n                  =\r\n  Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n                    To: EVP-I=\r\nTC@yahoogroups .com\n                    Date: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 9:29 AM=\r\n\n\n\n                          I always save the whole file in wav format the=\r\nn do my clips as mp3.

When \n          you email a file=\r\n, if it is not saved as a compressed format, the email \n          filtering=\r\n process will actually compress the file \n          automatically.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;So even if you have attac=\r\nhed a \n          wav. file, it will loose resolution over the email process=\r\n.

You would see =\r\na lot of colored \n                  blocks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Or in the other directio=\r\nn, imagine you are \n                  looking at a competely randomize bunc=\r\nh of pixes on your \n                  screen: a complete screen of truely r=\r\nandom static snow.&nbsp; \n                  Pixelizing this, after a while,=\r\n you would again start to see \n                  colored blocks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wha=\r\nt&#39;s happening is that it is \n                  processing an area of the im=\r\nage, taking (for instance) the \n                  average value of that ent=\r\nire area, and replacing all the \n                  blocks in that area with=\r\n the average.&nbsp; In video \n                  processing, this would resu=\r\nlt in a field of multi-colored \n                  flowers being replaced by=\r\n, for instance, a big greyish-bluish \n                  block, with no rese=\r\nmblance to flowers.&nbsp; In the noise \n                  example, it maybe=\r\n replace all the random pixels with another \n                  big greyish-=\r\nbluish block.&nbsp; If you did not know beforehand \n                  what =\r\nthe original picture was, you couldn&#39;t tell whether your \n                 =\r\n pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, the \n             =\r\n     sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It works \n       =\r\n           the same with the sound files.&nbsp; Taking something as \n      =\r\n            complex as speech, and replacing frequencies with their \n      =\r\n            averages, loses the speech the farther you go, until you head \n=\r\n                  strange fluctuating square waves.&nbsp; Doing the same to=\r\n \n                  random static will eventually produce the same thing.&n=\r\nbsp; \n                  And random fluctuating square waves can sound a bit=\r\n like \n                  speech - or at least, you could have fun sharing w=\r\nith each \n                  other what you thing they &#39;sound \n             =\r\n     like&#39;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Sun, 5/10/09, Misty \n         =\r\n         Dawn &lt;I&gt;&lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
