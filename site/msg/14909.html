      It wasn't suicide, it was accidental:
      Carradine =
Death Was Accidental

      IMDb, June 4, 2009

      David Carradine died =
during a sex game that went wrong, according to sources in Bangkok, Thailan=
d, where he was found dead on Thursday.

      Carradine's body was discove=
red in a hotel suite and local reports suggested he committed suicide. 

  =
    He was discovered by a maid, naked and hanged, but the suggestions his =
death had a sexual twist were strongly disputed by the star's close friend,=
 attorney Vicki Roberts, and his manager Chuck Binder, who insisted he died=
 of natural causes. 

      But a statement from Carradine's representative=
 now indicates the actor died during a sex act.

      The spokesperson tel=
ls TMZ.com, "We can confirm 100 percent that he never would have committed =
suicide. It was an accidental death. Everybody is in shock." 

      Rumour=
s Carradine died attempting auto-erotic asphyxiation--where victims achieve=
 heightened sexual pleasure by restricting their air supply are backed up b=
y a quote a Bangkok police officer gave to British newspaper The Sun. 

   =
   The cop tells reporters, "A rope was attached to his neck and also to hi=
s penis". 

      Rocker Michael Hutchence was rumoured to have died attemp=
ting the same sex act in a Sydney, Australia, hotel room back in 1997--alth=
ough his death was officially declared a suicide.

      Carradine was in T=
hailand to shoot the movie "Stretch." He was 72.
