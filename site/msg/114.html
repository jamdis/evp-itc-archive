Martin Ebon quotes the following remarks made by Edison to the 
Scientific American interviewer: 
&quot;If our personality survives, then it is strictly logical and 
scientific to assume that it retains memory, intellect, and other 
faculties and knowledge that we acquire on this earth. Therefore, if 
personality exists after what we call death, it&#x27;s reasonable to 
conclude that those who leave this earth would like to communicate 
with those they have left here. 
. . . I am inclined to believe that our personality hereafter will 
be able to affect matter. If this reasoning be correct, then, if we 
can evolve an instrument so delicate as to be affected, or moved, or 
manipulated . . . by our personality as it survives in the next 
life, such an instrument, when made available, ought to record 
something. 
Certain of the methods now in use are so crude, so childish, so 
unscientific, that it is amazing how so many rational human beings 
can take any stock in them. If we ever do succeed in establishing 
communication with personalities which have left this present life, 
it certainly won&#x27;t be through any of the childish contraptions which 
seem so silly to the scientist. &quot;


 I think Edison assumed the communication would be complicated and 
difficult, but with our present technology, it is like childs play.
