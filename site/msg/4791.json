My cousin \nJim is in PSI, and purchased a 469 for the group.  He had heard some \nof my initial recordings of experiments I ran for audio set-up.  They \nwere recorded with the 469, and did not come through until the 5th \ntest for me.  It was as if the mish mash began being manipulated and \nI could then hear responses.  The recordings are under LC&#39;s... in the \nfile section.  I currently have two 470&#39;s which will be experimented \nwith after the holidays...\n\nThe more you work with the box, the more those on the other side \nbecome aware of one&#39;s attempts at making contact, IMHO.  For me, I \ncan feel a spiritual presence when the audio bits/white noise begin \nbeing manipulated.  When in doubt, just keep making \nrecordings...sooner or later you will begin hearing words, responses, \nsentences.  Some of what I heard has been quite crafty, such as \ngiving me my wife&#39;s name clearly, right before she phoned me, etc.\n\nLC\n\n\n --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;babiarz3&quot; &lt;babiarz3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks Juli, it&#39;s nice to be back. Holiday times always get so \nhectic.\n&gt; \n&gt; On a side note here- I&#39;ve been working with a 469 shack hack and \nhave\n&gt; yet to get anything I can consider a direct response or intelligible\n&gt; communication. IMO, thus far, I hear nothing besides radio \nfragments.\n&gt; Going on the theory that this device enables the same real time 2-\nway\n&gt; communication as Frank&#39;s Box or it&#39;s &quot;children&quot;, requesting that my\n&gt; own name be said doesn&#39;t seem like it should be a difficult task. I\n&gt; have even told them my name, as a just-in-case measure. Nothing even\n&gt; resembling my name, or in name for that matter. When asked what \ntheir\n&gt; name is, also nothing but radio fragment. Sessions with EVPmaker \nhave\n&gt; always provided intelligent responses and results.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, juli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nice to see your back in the swing of things!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; babiarz3 &lt;babiarz3@&gt; wrote:          Here are a few links to some\n&gt; of Chris&#39; public sessions with the Box.\n&gt; &gt; These files are easy enough to find.

I have heard \nseveral \n&gt; &gt; &gt; where some of the audio is clear enough to stand on its own \nwithout \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his interpretation, and where his interpretation generally \nagrees. I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have also heard some where the audio I hear disagrees with his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation, but not to such a high degree that I was \novertly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; troubled by it--it was in what I would call the high-end of my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tolerance range for subjectivity. I have heard audio where the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; person asking questions of the box clearly heard answered that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; appeared to move them greatly without dependance on Chris&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, to try to sum up for you, my personal investigation led me \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe that something was happening with the box. I did not \nalways \n&gt; &gt; &gt; agree with Chris&#39;s interpretation, but it appeared the same or \nclose \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to what I heard a high enough percentage of the time that I was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; willing to accept he was not faking it, but giving it an honest \n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough go. It led me to start hounding Frank for a box of my \nown, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; later to buy a minibox from Rick, since poor Frank was beset on \nall \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sides. ;)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We&#39;ve already had some spectacularly burning arguments about \nwhat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris claims his guides or technicians tell him behind closed \ndoors. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, no audio of this is public, so his claims \ncan&#39;t be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; evaluated. I think the proliferation of people getting results \nwith \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the boxes belies his assertion that only 30 are chosen.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Dec 30, 2007, at 11:09 PM, Robin Henson wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think some of you were discussing this recently, but I&#39;m \nwondering\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what you all think.
