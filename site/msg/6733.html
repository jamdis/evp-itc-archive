<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Right now, I am exclusively using my minibox #114. My son, Nick, is  
using an RS 20-125 hack exclusively. He&#x27;s only had it two weeks, so  
he&#x27;s just getting started. I&#x27;ve only been doing this for about a  
month and half, myself, remember. ;) I don&#x27;t get to run a session  
everyday. It&#x27;s more like once a week, right now, I&#x27;ve been so busy  
with my real life. I understand your point, however. I&#x27;m excited to  
try Nick&#x27;s box out when I get a chance.

&gt; I hear this file loud and clear without the slow down.
&gt;
&gt; I have a question, Do you have an RS box or what other
&gt; boxes do you have besides a minibox?
&gt;
&gt; The reason I&#x27;m asking is if you have other boxes you will want to  
&gt; rotate them equally
&gt; and do sessions with all. The reason for that is you will allow  
&gt; your tech/guide to stay
&gt; familiar and associated with all the boxes you have and you will  
&gt; want your &quot;ear&quot; to be attuned
&gt; to the rhythm and sound of all your boxes so that at any given time  
&gt; you can use anyone for a session and
&gt; be successful in understanding the communication. Also you may find  
&gt; that at a particular time you may be
&gt; doing a session with the MB and not getting good results, you can  
&gt; switch to the RS 470 and have a better session.
&gt;
&gt; In any case you will want to have research results from all the  
&gt; various boxes available to you.
