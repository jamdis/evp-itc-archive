  Bruce,

  With the =
thousands of Elvis impersonators out there, many of them who 
  have crosse=
d over, do you think maybe one of them came through for 
  you?
  I knew a =
person who was hand picked by Elvis to work for him at 
  Graceland in the =
early days at Graceland. Maybe the next time "he" 
  comes through you can =
inquire as to the name of this person I know, 
  that he knows.
  This pers=
on was "very special" to him and she was hand picked by 
  Elvis based on h=
er looks (she told me that), even though the duties 
  she provided at Grac=
eland were none such that good looks were 
  required.

  I'm hoping if it =
is Elvis, he will know who you are inquiring about. 
  Only he would know t=
his, not an Elvis impersonator.

  Tell him her father's last name begins w=
ith the letter "R" and he 
  traveled with "MP". He only needs to give you =
her first name.

  With this information I have provided, there is no doubt=
 that "he" 
  will know who you are asking about.

  - Mike
