<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My purpose was to discuss the testing protocol, to make it as
objective as possible, and to minimize possible prejudice.  The
problem, is that there could be a predisposition to hear what someone
has already described: it is only a possibility, not a certainty. 
But, since it is possible to minimize this issue with a change in the
test, I recommended that.  

Maybe I would better understand your issue if you told me where my
suggestions would not add value and objectivity to the test.  I am
happy to learn from the group and work out even better testing
protocols by discussion and feedback.

&gt; You seem to be assuming a built in prejudice amongst the

&gt; &gt;   Prejudice refers to prejudgment. So, in this case, prejudice
meant to
&gt; &gt; already be ready to hear what someone already described, rather than
&gt; &gt; listening before you have that information, and so can maximize your
&gt; &gt; objectivity.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe you could clarify what you meant by my viewpoint? I didn&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; understand the comment.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Funny you use the word prejudice. Says a bit about your viewpoint.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To insure this testing is objective, wouldn&#x27;t it have been
best not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to inform everyone what kind of disaster these items were
from? Now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that everyone knows they are from a plane crash, that will set
up the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prejudice of hearing plane/travel related words in the evp noises.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as you probably know, once that prejudice is active, once
I say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Doesn&#x27;t that sound like someone saying
&quot;Sssssstewardesssss...&quot;, then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone hears THAT word, rather than just noise, or, for example
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Stewed ass&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And, if something does sound like a plane/travel related word, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will now be highlighted as an example of why this was a successful
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test, and the other less-relevant words ignored. This is a form of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confirmation bias, which again, hurts the value of the test.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A more objective way would have been to send out both crash
related
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; items, and completely innocuous items, with no explanation of
where
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each was from, and see what kind of EVPs were returned on each.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Further, the returned EVPs should then be returned to someone to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaluate who ALSO doesn&#x27;t know the origin of the objects, so that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they do not torture the interpretations into the forms you
hope and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expect them to be (again, plane/travel related). While this
test of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course lacks all kinds of controls, this would at least be a
start to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defining a double-blind test, which is the gold standard for good
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; research in this kind of research.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though you have tried to keep some of the information quiet,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is still quite a large opportunity for guessing and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coincidence. For example, one person might assume this was from an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; airshow (since, as you said, the event was very fast, and many
people
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saw it), and so only send in EVPs that would be relevant to that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation (I.e. Not sending in child-like sounds, or sending in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sounds that sound like scratchy tower or inter-plane
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication). If the crash was a commercial airline, then dozens
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of different people could have been killed, which means you could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find SOME relevancy no matter what noises are returned to you:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practical any word, name, or sound will support some
speculation that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it could have been relevant to one of those people.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do think it is a good idea to test your theories. But my purpose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here is to suggest ways to help these tests be as objective as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, and for your efforts and testing to be as worth while as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, and for the youtube video results you make to be as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; valuable and bulletproof as possible. But I am concerned that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; above scenario is full of opportunity for subjectivity and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misinterpretation.
