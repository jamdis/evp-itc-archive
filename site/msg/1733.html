What happens when you flip them both on at the same time? LOL maybe they will 'cancel' each other out and you will have two "normal" working boxes again. Give it a try and let me know the end results will ya.
   
  I have had evp where some said they prefer one method over another and I did get alot of neg stuff when I first started using evpmaker. Once I became more focused and at peace with the process and set a few guidelines for my sessions I find any method pretty much the same as another. My friends/family cussed like sailors anyway so for some its just language and not an attack. As for the ones who like to attack or play mind games, they usually get kicked out or interrupted after the first words they speak. It's just one of the guidelines I set as well as speak one at a time with a loud voice if possible. 
   
  Works well for me. I gave in to a couple things in return for those. Cant hurt to try.

Does anybody think it's possible to get 2 extreme opposites in 
communication? 1 Box curses at me constantly and tells me to die and 
also talks about the end of the world and hell. And the other one 
talks about how pretty it is there and i always get "Hi" and "I'm 
Here" as well as "Don't leave" when i'm signing off and an 
occasional "Goodbye". Has anyone experienced anything like this 
before? The 1 box even shuts off appliances in my house when i use 
it, i guess i'll stop using that one for now until i figure out a 
solution to what's going on. Any ideas?????
