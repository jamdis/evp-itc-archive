<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Frank for the clarification.
I havent played with TRF chips for years, but I remember they were dead silent in between stations, which has to be good. I seem to remember the selectivity wasnt too good, but I may have had too much gain happening.
Presently been playing with a head-less 12-469, which seems quite good and also quiet in between stations. I guess you rate the MK484 better due to it having no mixer noise?
I found an article on the ZN414, and thought I should share it, as its got a new slant on RF Gain control, by tapping down the AGC feedback via a pot. It should allow much greater control of the chips response to strong signals. The cct in question is shown down the page here ....

&gt;  I used a different op amp, the LM358, but everything else is the same.  You
