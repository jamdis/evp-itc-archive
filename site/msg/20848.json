Keep the=\r\n  \nelectricity, but, we should work on building more Solar panel&#39;s on homes=\r\n,   wind \nturbines, and at least be granted big discounts by government to =\r\nhave these  \nthings installed in our homes.  People would lose some jobs, b=\r\nut they could  do \nsimilar without all the stress, Pilots could take on cro=\r\np dusting for a  \nwhile, lol  forest and land developers could become growe=\r\nrs, planters for  new \ntrees.  Stop tearing out mountains for awhile, let t=\r\nhe trees take root,  so \nwhat if we must go the long way for awhile or thin=\r\ngs take more time, there  \nwould be less land slides.  With less driving wo=\r\nuld be less need for oil,  \nless pumping, stop with the fishing for awhile =\r\ntoo, over 90% of the oceans \nare  now being over harvested!  If we could st=\r\nop eating so much of any one  \nthing, things could improve, thing is, this =\r\nwhole world would need to see \nthings  this way in order to save itself.  W=\r\ne may not be getting as warm as we  \nthink, even worse we are more then lik=\r\nely going into an ice age if we are \nnot  careful, and the world is becomin=\r\ng off balance, or is shifting, and just \nmelting  away without it&#39;s interna=\r\nl support system.
