Hi Fol=
ks,

Recently I did an investigation at the Lincoln Theater in Decatur, IL
=
with my Mini-Box, and got some interesting clips from the basement
area.  T=
he files are too large to be uploaded to the forum here, but a
short video =
with the audio clips has been posted on You Tube by Joey
Tito, a Chicago re=
searcher who filmed the investigation.  The audio
clips are at the end, and=
 Joey matched them to a transcript of what I
picked up.  I sent the clips t=
o Frank, and he picked up even more.

The You Tube link is www.youtube.com/=
xflexx1  Joey has a short version
and a long version; pick the short one.

=
I have a report on the investigation posted on my blog on MySpace at
www.my=
space.com/rosemaryellenguiley  and Joey's video is on my home
page there as=
 well.  The blog also has my report on a similar
investigation at Ohio Stat=
e Reformatory in Mansfield; the clips from
that are posted on this forum in=
 my folder.

Regards,
Rosemary
