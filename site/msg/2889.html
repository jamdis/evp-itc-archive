<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There have been no indications of upcoming earthquakes on the ULF-ELF 
group I&#x27;m on, either. Maybe these guys can&#x27;t really predict the future so 
well. I don&#x27;t think they always lie.

&gt; Still no EQ in China, lying swine voices! I don&#x27;t get that , I can get 
&gt; stuff that&#x27;s clearly not broadcast fragments, or anything else Earthly, 
&gt; why the lying crap, and why the false prophecy? Who was it that was 
&gt; quoting someone that said the spirits always lie?
&gt;
&gt; I think ya have to ask the questions about what it is, I think you have 
&gt; to go out on that limb and see what&#x27;s out there, even if it doesn&#x27;t fit 
&gt; anyone&#x27;s paradigm. I think those that think they have the knowledge to 
&gt; ask the right questions, and can discern who&#x27;s who in the unseen 
&gt; world.....are fools. I have these crack heads insist I&#x27;m their girl, 
&gt; their Little Purple Space Princess, yes it resonates, or whatever you&#x27;d 
&gt; call it, but I wouldn&#x27;t trade my soul for it. The word &quot;contract&quot; has 
&gt; come up many times in my recordings, and I always tell them there ain&#x27;t 
&gt; no damn contract! I go to nothingness first. Religious or not, there &#x27;s 
&gt; somthing out there that buys/collects souls, and it is not a metaphor! 
&gt; You must choose your steps in life wisely, but fearlessly. Never, ever 
&gt; say &quot;I&#x27;ll do anything for....&quot;.
