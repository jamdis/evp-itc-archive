<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t really have any experience in ritual magic at all. Like Frank 
R, I really was trying to introduce who the operator is and the 
intention behind Box sessions, especially since Box 21 was calling 
for Frank S so much.

 Mark Macy did a calling for the ethereals to provide protection, and 
that was something that I generally haven&#x27;t been a participant to 
before as I come from more of an objective evidence gathering 
perspective. But experience with the Box has made me realize that the 
Boxes are more than just an assemblage of components, there is a 
paranormal phenomena going on when answers to questions are heard. 
You can&#x27;t always say it&#x27;s just by chance certain words are heard that 
specifically address the concerns of those that are present during a 
session.

The term &quot;imprint&quot; I believe was first stated by Rosemary during that 
initial session with Box 21 at the Stanley Hotel. When we imprinted 
her Box in Philidelphia, it was more of a focused event that 
suggested ritual but that may be overstating it. She is experienced 
in these matters and an atmosphere was created by her that felt on 
target. I have a lot of respect for her and she brought in the right 
amount of energy. I hope all this helps. -Bill

&gt; DOH! That&#x27;s what I thought too. Although there&#x27;s alot to said for 
ritual 
&gt; magic. I used to do some, but it involved tobacco rituals, as in 
Native 
&gt; American type,  and I&#x27;m not allowed to touch the stuff now, but the 
results 
&gt; were profound, even for me.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Oh, that&#x27;s what you mean by imprinting. I had this vision in my 
head that 
&gt; &gt;you were doing some new age, melodramatic ritual over the box to 
infuse it 
&gt; &gt;with some kind of magical energy. All you were doing is making our 
spirit 
&gt; &gt;colleagues aware of your presence and intentions to use the box.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;We did the same sort of thing with a statement of intent and 
introduction.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanx for the feedback,
&gt; &gt;
