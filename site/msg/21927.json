Comments are always welcome. :)\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Jamie Churchill &lt;thequilldriver@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Here are two recordings I made using Steve&#39;s file at\n&gt; http://stevehultay.com/evpsoftware.html*. *These recordings are interesting\n&gt; because I get several really blatant messages that seem relevant to me\n&gt; personally, they are incredibly clear in spots, and also because it seems\n&gt; that the responses are better heard when you play the file back at roughly\n&gt; 150% of the normal speed. I haven&#39;t altered these files in any way. These\n&gt; are both stored on SoundCloud.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://soundcloud.com/jamietreetalker/evp-maker-082511-1000am\n&gt; \n&gt; In this first file, done August 25, 2011 at 10:00 a.m. It seems like they&#39;re\n&gt; addressing two things: (1) my worries that something I don&#39;t like is living\n&gt; in my basement, and (2) my concern over further developing my psychic\n&gt; abilities. Before this recording, I did a protection prayer and asked that\n&gt; the &quot;angels&#39; or beings of love and light protect me, my family, and this\n&gt; property.\n&gt; \n&gt; :01 Here&#39;s Tim\n&gt; :02 Will Help. You are worried. 8-0-0\n&gt; :04 Urkel hates it out here, now hell on Earth\n&gt; :08 You worried here are?

Before\n&gt; this recording, I asked that they tell me who they are and to give me some\n&gt; detail about themselves.  At :12, they say &quot;She finds our obits.&quot; This is\n&gt; true. I found two obituaries for the man who built this house and his\n&gt; brother, both of whom died within the last year or so. Further on, they talk\n&gt; about animal therapy, which I had once discussed with my husband doing with\n&gt; our two golden retrievers, both of whom were locked out of the room while I\n&gt; recorded.\n&gt; \n&gt; :02 Well, I&#39;m here to help people out.\n&gt; :04 Here there are people that help me\n&gt; :05 They faked it. the whole outfit.\n&gt; :07 I fear the outcome.\n&gt; :09 Down stairs I hear them\n&gt; :12 She finds our obit\n&gt; :13 You have to warn people that there&#39;s a terrible quake.\n&gt; :14 The people end earth and they&#39;re worried.\n&gt; :17 They&#39;ll thank you\n&gt; :18 Yeah, he killed Elliott\n&gt; :20 You killed Ike. I fell over, I got killed. It&#39;s Earl.?\n&gt; :24 There are people in poor houses.\n&gt; :26 I am worried\n&gt; :27 Here people are in poor health.\n&gt; :29 Year ??
