It seems like a couple possibilities:

1) The predictions are accurate, yet=
 the people getting them are not putting together and distributing a statem=
ent warning the world, to perhaps save the lives of some that take precauti=
ons (Like, east coasters, etc).=A0 In this case these researchers lives wil=
l be ruined=A0 when it is discovered that they knew what was going to happe=
n but were silent (not to mention what kind of people they must be inside t=
o not have at least tried to help.)

2) The predictions are bogus, and peop=
le are just hearing what they want to hear.=A0 In this case, maybe they'll =
learn whether they really believed in EVPs or not: those who try to distrib=
ute a statement warning the world and are wrong, will learn that what they =
believe is not very accurate.=A0 Those who do not distribute such a warning=
 already know what they are hearing is fake, and so they'll learn something=
 about themselves and their motives (as will those watching their predictio=
ns).

So I think it's a good test of EVPs - but, I think it is also a good =
test of the character of the people recording them.=A0 If they believe ther=
e is disaster on Aug 15, what does it say about them if they do nothing and=
 are silent?=A0 If they are not sure of its accuracy either way, what does =
it say of them that they are silent, when they admit the possibility of dis=
aster and are silent?=A0 And if they dismiss the predictions completely, is=
 there any reason to report the predictions other than ego?

All in all, I'=
d suggest if you do not believe this stuff, stop hearing dates.=A0 People t=
hat predict dates (end of the world etc) get discredited as fringe cults wh=
en those predictions don't arrive.=A0 Instead, hear things like "in the fut=
