Hey Debbie thanks for gettin back to me...you just seem so laid back talking on the Maury show, I cant picture you freaking out hehe.  I figured it was them doing some creative editing when they got the film back.  I bookmarked your site...didnt reallize you were part of AA-EVP til I saw your story video on your website...then I realized I had listened to your EVPs before and they are a big reason I got i nterested in EVP research.  That website was my very first look into the world of EVP and other audio/video phenomenom...its very informative and still my top fave  I'll check your website in a bit for more pics and stuff.
   
  Thanks!
  Rhonda

          Hi Rhonda... Thanks so much for watching! Meredith (Maury's PA) was 
great to work with .. and honestly .. she didn't freak out as much as 
I did! There was a lot going on including a member of my Team got 
wacked in the leg ... We have lots more video, evp's and pictures to 
post on my site .. It was just plain creepy! Chris filmed that 
apparition as soon as we walked in the door so I knew we were in for 
a terrifying night...
