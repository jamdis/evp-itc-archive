&gt; I was looking for some practice on investigating so I found an old small
&gt; cemetery. It is a couple hundred yards from the state&#x27;s largest supplier of
&gt; crushed limestone for the last 100 years. The grass was mowed but that was
&gt; the extent of the upkeep. Many tombstones were broken and tossed to the
&gt; outside edge of the cemetery. Many children were buried there. The oldest
&gt; tombstone we found was1815. It was 60 degrees the whole time were there. We
&gt; were sooo cold and we could easily see our breath. I&#x27;ve never heard of any
&gt; paranormal experiences regarding here and we&#x27;ve decided to keep
&gt; it anonymous  in an attempt to preserve what is left. The photos are kind of
&gt; &quot;iffy&quot; I might be seeing things where there isn&#x27;t anything. I&#x27;d appreciate
&gt; any feedback.

WOw, some of the images are interesting. Faces in the woods, simple answer is matrixing. But it would be a good place to conduct continuing investigations. If you get more images and EVPs you have something to compare and develope more evidence.  Good Work.</pre>
