<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve &amp; Mike,

&gt; If we can get the allophone file with real human voices, than this
&gt; would be the next step i think.  

This probably wouldn&#x27;t work; the allophones must all have the same
pitch to fit together when concatenated.

&gt; In a box recording you can get an assemblance of male or female, and
&gt; you can even get language accents. ie british, indian, spanish, etc...
&gt; With the allophone/soap, you have one electroinic voice.
   
Of course the robotic sound of the SpeechJet allophones is far from
being natural speech, but it seems to allow longer messages than other
raw audio with more variety of the sounds. So it seems we&#x27;ll have to
decide between information content and naturalness/individuality of the
voices.

Stefan</pre>
