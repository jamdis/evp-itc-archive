The only thing I have gotten is a cursed word used \ndescribing someone and it just so happened that one night we were \ndoing a white noise vs pink noise experiment and running late so we \ndidn&#39;t pray. So personally I believe it makes a difference, but it&#39;s \nreally up to the individual. Personally, I feel alike attracts alike. \nSo staying positive and upbeat before hand and during probably really \nmakes a difference no matter what.\n\nWe have also captured a good many apparition over the years via \ncamera, and again prayer is done whenever we are going out on an \ninvestigation or paranormal shooting. The ones we have captured they \nalways seem to be running or going a different direction than us, so \nagain I feel it makes a difference. We have two Pagans on our team. \nOne prays, and one doesn&#39;t. The one that does is just starting out \nand has been getting some great shots and a few EVP&#39;s. The one that \ndoesn&#39;t in 2 years has only gotten a few shots and no EVP&#39;s......but \nI leave the choice up to each team member.\n\nThat&#39;s my thoughts on it, it really boils down to personal \npreferences.\n\nGabreael\nwww.easternparanormal.com\n\nPS - I have started a discussion group for E.P.&#39;s radio show. Is it \nOK if I post the link here? If not that&#39;s OK too :)"}
