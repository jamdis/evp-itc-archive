<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, the same people who told us it&#x27;s there in the first place put up the
photos of the comet as it progressively got smaller.  Since the source of
the info is the same people, why would you believe it was there in the first
place if you don&#x27;t believe the photos they are now putting up? Maybe it was
never even there in the first place.

&gt; Confusing! I was hearing all this stuff about it being the doomsday comet,
&gt; so I actaully(yeah I know, not believable) went out and looked at it, and
&gt; saw it as nothing a few weeks ago. Then all these proclamations of what a
&gt; nothin&#x27; it really is. I think the claims of it being distroyed are
&gt; bogus--it&#x27;s just the fake prophets trying to cover their asses. &quot;My guys&quot;
&gt; have, and still maintain Christmas-2012. If that proves to be nothin&#x27; as
&gt; well, gonna pile the boxes up and lite them on fire! The lesson, don&#x27;t
&gt; listen to internet fucktards.
