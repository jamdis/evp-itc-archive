But Justin is a popular name. As I think\n&gt; there were two I knew with that name. They both went out that way. One I\n&gt; didn&#39;t know well.\n&gt; Usually when they are stuck here there is a reason, often personal. Like\n&gt; unfinished business or guilt and such. Sounds like he needs help crossing\n&gt; over as many earthbound spirits do. But, in my experience, there are many\n&gt; types of spiritual encounters. Some come to visit and help.\n&gt; I just had to reply. This stuff is certainly different. Stressful sometimes\n&gt; too.\n&gt; signed,\n&gt; I forgot my name for this group. Never a dull day.
