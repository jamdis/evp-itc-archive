<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>We just purchased another 12-469. Some things seam different. The first 
thing that struck me was the numbers in the digital read out are 
smaller and darker. The blue glow is brighter. So the new fancy dancy 
box looks so much better than my old one so what? But it stuck in the 
back of my mind. After doing the snip-a-roo and fireing up the bad 
fella there was a response within the first 2 min saying the persons 
name that the box was built for. Ok may be power of intent. But when 
switched over to am that lovely CLICK CLICK CLICK wasnt so annoying. I 
could actually tolerate lisening to a recording without getting a 
migraine! And there were actual results from an AM sweep. So have they 
done mods to this model? The back of the radio has the same numbers on 
it. For anyone interested in the first recording here is the link.
