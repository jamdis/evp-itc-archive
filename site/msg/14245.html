<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I know it&#x27;s more complicated, but have you thought of using a direct
frequency synthesis chip like the Analog Devices AD9835 or AD9850 and a PIC
or AVR microcontroller to adjust the frequency? These chips are impossible
to pull off frequency and are easily made to sweep in any manner you wish,
with the microcontroller. I&#x27;ve been playing with generating spread-spectrum
signals with them.

&gt;   I have kind of a steep learning curve, so while the NE602/612 radio
&gt; works, it has a bigger foot print cuz it requires some extra amplifiers for
&gt; the audio. I have about 70 of the LM3820 chips, they are an AM radio chip,
&gt; with all functions except the audio detector. I had trouble getting this
&gt; chip to work a couple years ago, but since I&#x27;ve learned some tricks, like
&gt; adding the oscillator buffer to keep the freq counter from pulling the
&gt; frequency way off, other wise, ya think you have the frequency range set,
&gt; but in use it&#x27;s completely out of the AM band, so no stations get picked
&gt; up.Then I was not aware of how to set up the ferrite rod antenna. The
&gt; 602/612s are $2 something each, the Lm3820--12 cents from B. G. Micro(in
&gt; tubes of 25). I set up the oscillator last night, then re-drew the
&gt; schematic. I used a regulated supply to hopefully make the oscialltor more
&gt; stable, but the chip will function on 12 volts-besides, come to think about
&gt; it, it has a built in regulator, so the 8V regulator is overkill, maybe even
&gt; harmful in that  the internal regulator wouldn&#x27;t have enough head room.

I know i &#x27;s mo e complica ed, bu ha e you hough o using a di ec equency syn hesis chip like he Analog De ices AD9835 o AD9850 and a PIC o AVR mic ocon olle o adjus he equency? These chips a e impossible o pull o equency and a e easily made o sweep in any manne you wish, wi h he mic ocon olle . I&#x27; e been playing wi h gene a ing sp ead-spec um signals wi h hem.
