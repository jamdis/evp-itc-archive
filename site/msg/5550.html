As someone who has never used a protection ritual (even though I consider m=
yself a very spiritual person), I'm not sure I understand what the ritual i=
s intended to protect the person invoking it from.  I'm not being a smart a=
ss; I'm simply trying to learn.  Can we be hurt physically or psychically b=
y certain spirits, or can our experimentation open a dark portal that's not=
 meant to be opened?  My instinct has always been that if I don't acknowled=
ge evil it can have no power over me, but perhaps that's ignorant.  I once =
invited spirits into my house from outside and immediately recorded a negat=
ive EVP while heating a cup of coffee in the microwave.  I was too ecstatic=
 to be frightened by the message, but since then I've wondered what kind of=
 spirit would want to say such a thing to me and if I should be more cautio=
us in the future.  I would love some feedback on this recording.

  Bad idea! In my opinion. You just create fear w=
ith that crap, and 
  fear feeds itself. Once again, you will create what y=
ou expect to 
  get. If you use protection BS, you'll have convinced yourse=
lf that 
  there is something to be affraid of, and so you will tend to cre=
at a 
  thoughtform to fulfill that expectation.
