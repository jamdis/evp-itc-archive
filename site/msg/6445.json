The owner of this home asked if I \nwould bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed with the \nimmediately 2 way communication).  So upon respectfully asking my tec \nif it was alright to do a session outside the my home we did several \nbox sessions along with conventional EVP.  We wanted to see if we could \ndiscover some unanswered history about the residence, and the otherside \nwas more than willing to comply.  \n\nI have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were and are the \nmost boring data to review.  Something I use to love so much has \nactually turned into a project given I am waiting for a response \nimmediately!  Too funny how things can change overnight!\n\nI will be uploading some files for these sessions if you are interested.\n\nJuli"}
