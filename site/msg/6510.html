Yep Steve you are right. I have even tried emailing a few people programs to easily convert them to no avail. Some people just want to ignore what is being said but soon they will have no choice but to listen.

          Misty,

I have and idea. One solution is to post Mp3 files instead of Wav. 
files or any other format. It seems like the Mp3's sound the same 
and are only 1/10th of the size. I think that would probably clear 
up 90 percent of the board right there. If i actually have more than 
a couple files from here on out, i will be attaching them to an e-
mail and not the board to save space here. And also, if people do 
post files maybe we can all just have one post that says we have 
uploaded files to our folder instead of 30 audio announcements in a 
row that just seems to waste a lot of e-mail space in the individual 
e-mails. And it also pushes the current topic on the board to 
another page and is lost for those who wanted to share. Just my 
thoughts on helping the subject. I know we are all excited, but 
misty is right. I went to add a file the other day and the group was 
at 93 percent capacity, so it won't be long before we run out of 
space.
