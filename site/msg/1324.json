I supplied a crystal microphone and audio pre-amplifier and fed this into the &#39;audio in&#39; on the VCR. Playback can be monitored on a TV set or the audio out can be fed to a computer. I post processed in ClearVoice to remove a slight 60hz hum and reduce the high frequencies. Background sound was provided by a high speed manual sweep tune of an FM broadcast radio. Here&#39;s a couple of the best so far.\n\n&quot;Time for amazing voices&quot;\n\nThis was a reverse playback capture &quot;Hey David.....I&#39;m grounded&quot;\n\nThanks for listening,\nDave\n\n         \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nLuggage?
