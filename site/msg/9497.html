<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, they do that a lot.  They call me &quot;urkel&quot; all the time and call 
frank &quot;Purple&quot;.  I even heard one of kristin&#x27;s files say &quot;Nitsirk&quot;, 
which is her name backwards.  It&#x27;s almost like they read these yahoo 
groups too.  They also probably do that to get our attention, 
shouting out a nickname would catch most people off guard and make 
them listen more.
