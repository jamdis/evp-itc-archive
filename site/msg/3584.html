<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>In my video which shows me modifying the Radio Shack 12-470 digital 
radio, I am modifying the older version of this radio. The one built in 
Aug 2006 with a date code of 08A06.  Radio Shack now has a newer 
version of the 12-470 that is showing up in some stores.  As of this 
time, no modification has been found for the newer version, date code 
of 06A07 (June 2007) (Black case). If you plan to modify a 12-470 make 
sure you buy the older version (Gray and white case) which can be seen 
in my video at www.ufogeek.com
The newer 12-470 looks similar to the 12-469 in style, except the 12-
470 is black, has a speaker, and a green ring around the button on the 
front; where the 12-469 is white, has no speaker and a blue ring around 
the button on the front.
The older 12-470 is gray and white, with three silver button on the 
front where the speaker is located. I&#x27;m assuming all the older versions 
of the 12-470 can be modified, but that is just an assumption.  They 
changed the circuit boards on the newer version of the 12-470 and there 
is no wire bundle lke in the older version.</pre>
