I looked at\nBox #1 and noticed the white noise came on almost immediately. With newer\nsingle supply system it takes close to ten minutes before random starts\nfunctioning, if it works at all. Another advantage of dual supply is that I\ncan use the single knob tone control circuit in the audio chain.\n\n The random sweep is derived from the white noise. The white noise *is\nnot*used for anything else in the box, white noise\n*is not* mixed with the audio.\n\n F-S\n\nT ying a box wi h he dual supply wi h andom and linea modes.
