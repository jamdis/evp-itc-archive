I&#39;ll have to listen to them in a little bit. \nIt&#39;s funny you mention St. Patrick.  I recently found out that one of\nmy ancestors was king of Ireland and was killed by St. Patrick because\nhe would not convert.  Changed my whole view on St. Patty&#39;s day.\n\nJeremy\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot;\n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; hey everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; I had a really terrific session recently and posted a bunch of files.
