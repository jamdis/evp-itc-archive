<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well April I guess we agree to disagree.  I feel that is what is great about
this community.  Each of us has our own opinions.  I just only hope that you
can respect mine as I do yours.  Healthly debates are good.  I just feel
that some people just need a little direction as I did.  To me in the end it
yes it does just and feul to the fire.  Isn&#x27;t that how we change peoples
minds, by debating our opinions.  I mean, I would have never found this
place if it wasn&#x27;t for a debate on another site.  All Frank is doing is
standing up for what he (and we) believe in.  Thank you Frank

&gt;  These people and people like them don&#x27;t matter. The ones that will be
&gt; swayed without looking into all the facts aren&#x27;t your friends anyway.
&gt; Getting into petty arguments with these people just brings you down to their
&gt; level. You look far more credible if you don&#x27;t even give them any heed.
&gt; People who are worthy of your energy and really want to know the truth
&gt; will look at both sides objectively. They will come to the source, as I
&gt; have.
&gt;
&gt; In the end, it will only cause more problems for you if you engage these
&gt; types.
&gt;
&gt; Besides that, who cares what ANYONE thinks? Who cares who sways who? Frank
&gt; should be doing this for himself first and foremost. He is not going to be
&gt; able to prove his recordings scientifically, so why bother to compete? All
&gt; he needs to do is prove them to himself.
&gt;
&gt; It is a total different thing to try and debunk evidence to actually prove
&gt; something. The skeptic debunks things so that he may be left with true
&gt; proof.
&gt;
&gt; That is not what these debunkers do. These guys say everything is
&gt; a debunked, without ever really testing.
&gt;
&gt; You are always willing to test new theories and technologies to really see
&gt; the truth of it yourself. This is why you are not a debunker. If you were a
&gt; debunker, you wouldn&#x27;t even try.

&gt;  Honestly Frank I say slap too.  I know that I am not very active in this
&gt; group but I do read everything.  To me that was a pure attack.  Yes they are
&gt; debunkers and they won&#x27;t believe anything, but if you don&#x27;t say anything and
&gt; just back down there is that one person out there that will be swayed they
&gt; way of the skeptic and will not here our side.  Slap away and let us be
&gt; heard and get our opinions and beliefs out there.  If it touches one person
&gt; (Like me I used to be one of those &quot;debunkers&quot; then I heard the stuff that
&gt; comes through ITC and EVP research) it is worth the carpal tunnel.  And to
&gt; add I am a investigator who still uses a debunking aspect toward the
&gt; investigation,  but I am also a researcher and if there is something new out
&gt; there I am always willing to test it and see what comes through.

&gt;&gt;   The problem with that Frank, is that it is a never ending battle and in
&gt;&gt; the end, you can&#x27;t win because nothing you do or say will change them. I
&gt;&gt; just ends up causing you more grief.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Not even worth wasting your carpal tunnel on that. The guy is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; debunker, not a skeptic. It won&#x27;t matter what evidence or argument you pose,
&gt;&gt;&gt; he, and people like him will never believe it. They are just as bad as
&gt;&gt;&gt; people who believe in everything blindly.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; A true skeptic remains unbiased-either way, until such a time as
&gt;&gt;&gt; something is proven 100% either way.
