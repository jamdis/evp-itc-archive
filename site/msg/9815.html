Thanks for clearing that up for me I was just confused. I thought 
maybe there was another Mini Box available that was more money. 

I would love to bid on your Mini Box but I dont want to get caught 
up in the EBay freezy. I can fully understand your wanting to get 
some of your investment back. Who knows maybe you get all your money 
back the people are bidding on it paid over $50.00 for a $24.99 
Radio Shack radio. :)

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; A few people have seen my ebay listing and commented about the 
price 
&gt; listed.
&gt; 
&gt; Ebay will not allow you to change a description after the item has 
&gt; been listed. They do however allow you to add and amending 
statement.
&gt; 
&gt; Which I have done In Big Bold Red Letters, the price listing was a 
&gt; mistake. I am certainly not trying to misrepresent the item or 
make a 
&gt; profit on it.
&gt; 
&gt; I have also lowered the reserve price on it as a result of the 
&gt; mistake.
&gt; Believe me I will be taking a loss on the box.
&gt; 
&gt; I have already sent my apologies to Rick Moran from Paranormal 
&gt; systems.
&gt; 
&gt; And now extend my apologies for the mistake to anyone that was 
&gt; interested in it.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason for selling the MB was not the money, it was the guilt 
of 
&gt; having this excellent piece of equipment go without the attention 
it 
&gt; deserves. And the hopes that someone or some group can utilize it 
&gt; more than myself.
&gt; 
&gt; But I could not as much as I would have liked to, give it away.
&gt; My intention was to get back at least a decent amount of my 
&gt; investment.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope no one gets the wrong idea and thinks ill of me.
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce
