Ok ok Ok that's enough, one more warning and you will be banned. And that's
the end of the hateful discussion, anyone using abusive language will be
banned this is a Mature group of researchers and experimenters.

Sorry guy's 
 
Was just finishing up deleting my files from the files section when
I saw this post and being an italian from brooklyn just could not live with
myself if I didn't
respond.
 
Michelle be carefull what you say, if you are looking for a fraud you need
look no further than the end of your nose, which is where you will find the
asshole of the biggest fraud in the buisness.
your lord and master, need I mention the name, if you actuall took the time
to shut that sewer you call a mouth and listened to my files you would
realise that most of them I repeat the real time answer I hear fluidly.
 
If you have the balls which I think you do, tell your little buddy to come
to jersey because as a real man I was disabled saving lives so I can not go
to him or I would have been there already. instead of sucking my mama's tit
like your mentor.
have him come to jersey and I will accomidate him in a live box session him
with his me with mine and we will see who the fraud really is. 
 
p.s. you would think after all that mouth action your jaw would be tired.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Babs has Issues!

You're correct Bruce, I only own a RS Hack 12-469 that I am testing.
You are incorrect about my concerns for research. You may look at me
as a stirrer of whatever you want to say I'm stirring. If it causes
one of you to consider the validity of the research then that is
great. One of you were very surprised to discover that time is being
removed from posted files. One of you freaked out when I suggested
that raw files should be whats posted. One offered to post both. One
said no way! One of you has files incredibly clearer than anyone else.
One of you is beginning to look a little less on the up and up. Two
have emailed me their own concerns for the integrity in research. Call
me what you will but, if integrity is what has you riled up, if a
desire for raw true files to be posted causes an issue then so be it.
Maybe your smelling the shit I stirred and maybe thats because you
just might be standing in it.

often--posting your own files and asking questions of researchers. For
example, "Hey, Ann--that file you just posted, I hear what you do, but
is anything clipped out of it? I think I hear a track silenced, too.
If so, why did you do that?" Then I get to answer and explain why I
did it that way, offer the raw clip, or whatever. It doesn't come off
as a broad attack--just a friendly question. Even Bruce wouldn't rip
out your living eyeballs for that. (Well... maybe he wouldn't, anyway.

see me get all rough-and-tumble over stuff like the Luminator when I
think it is it lacking convincing evidence. But it's waaaaaay too
early in "boxology" to try to make it perform as a pet circus animal.
Hell, we've been studying traditional EVP for 30 years and it still
won't perform on cue for the scientists or anyone else. But if you
just listen to what you get on your own and what all the others are
getting, it becomes very clear indeed that a real phenomenon is
occurring. Sure, some things we get that we think are paranormal may
be just radio fragments, but one radio fragment does not negate all
box communication. One tweaked clip is not indicative of a culture of
researcher deceit. One "I am Bazoozoo! Time to fry, foolish mortal!"
does not mean that the RS hacks are pathways to Satan's indoor
plumbing. There are no easy answers yet--and there may never be any.
And I'm not sure we're at the stage yet where we have the right to
demand The Truth or whether we would even see it if it was staring us
in the face.

Also,please don't misread what I actually said. The point I made, or
triedto make, about the investigators not hearing what I heard...
Iwouldn't have heard all of it in real time either. Too many
layers,too fast, etc. I have the luxury now of sitting and analyzing
the filein my own time. As for fear being a factor... I do believe
that the attitude of theinvestigators present during a session does
effect the outcome. EvenBruce who would rather cut my eyeballs out
with a razor has said thesame. If you think that I am scared, fine. If
I'm missing one thing itis probably a healthy dose of fear. Don't make
the mistake of missingthe points by name calling. I post my thoughts
here because it is an active group of peopleworking with this form of
ITC. You can call me a shit stirrer orwhatever you want. The point is
that I see issues that could beaddressed fairly easily. You can ignore
it or deflect all you want.For me, it's not about being friends, it's
about the research. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Ratka
