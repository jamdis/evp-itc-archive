<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, there&#x27;s other cultures that have that exact same date, according to
the History Channel, like the Iching, the Jews(?), the Egyptians, and
various european prhophets.  I think I&#x27;m the only one currently getting the
doomsville stuff.

&gt;    I agree that 2012 probably the end of some earth cycle. However I do

&gt;
&gt; You know the date 2012 comes from the end of the Mayan calendar. They
&gt; probably did align their calendar with the natural cycles of the earth. I
&gt; think they probably just left off at 2012 and didn&#x27;t bother to extend it for
&gt; the next cycle, whatever that would be.
&gt;
&gt; That&#x27;s my hunch anyway and that what I am going with it LOL!

&gt;  The reverse is often more distorted, I think I&#x27;m just used to listening
&gt; to them.
&gt;
&gt;  This is the stuff I&#x27;ve been getting since the first box &quot;earth goes boom&quot;,
&gt; and I think it&#x27;s 2012. which is at least pretty much accepted by all that
&gt; it&#x27;s the end of come current earth cycle.

&gt;&gt;    I received them just fine, with text and all. But it doesn&#x27;t surprise
&gt;&gt; me. Yahoo has been having alot of problems lately.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks for the clarification on that. That maybe why I didn&#x27;t get all the
&gt;&gt; stuff out of it that you did.

&gt;&gt;  That means what comes after is the reverse speech component. So di dthe
&gt;&gt; voices come through, but no text? I got a message form yahoo that it
&gt;&gt; couldn&#x27;t deliver the message, I put too many in.

&gt;&gt;&gt;     I rarely know if anyone hears this stuff, as few comment. The one
&gt;&gt;&gt; about sausage is kinda iffy.&quot;Princess, I never Liked that box...&quot; is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same on as &quot;Princess I love that box...&quot;, I just hear it different this
&gt;&gt;&gt; morning. That&#x27;s the only one I hear different from last night. I included
&gt;&gt;&gt; the forward, and reverse components.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  These are from the test I did to see if I could use a pre-recorded RAW
&gt;&gt;&gt; audio tape in areas wherer there&#x27;s no radio stations, sincve many insist on
&gt;&gt;&gt; going to &quot;haunted locations&quot; that have few, if any radio stations to use for
&gt;&gt;&gt; the raw audio. #48 has an aux input so other raw audio can be used.
