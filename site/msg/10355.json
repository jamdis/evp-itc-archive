That&#39;s definitely an idea to consider. Frank S. mentioned \nperhaps we can all just delete stuff after a set amount of time to \nkeep it continuously clear like post stuff for couple weeks then it \ngets moved over to another server like esnips or elsewhere. All good \nideas. \n\nI already started my transition and have moved many things over as \nwell as deleted. I am considering making a group account that only \ngroup members can upload to (esnips allows that type of file sharing \nbetween friends) I just havent had the time or focus to put into \nsetting it up (thats alot of emails to type in to add as friends \nLOL). Plus they are in middle of massive changes/updates so waiting \nfor the dust to settle. I also considered getting a private server \nsharing system set up so people could upload thier stuff but seems \ncomplicated for most who arent used to using ftp.\n\nKeep sharing ideas tho because eventually maybe we will make it \nbetter for everyone.\n\nI rather not set limits on sizes but when ya hit 96% full somethings \ngotta go LOL so we start small and work our way to the resolution. I \nstill attach most stuff to my posts for those that get individual \nemails it comes as a simple file attachment in email. So do many \nothers here. That also helps.\n\nMisty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Misty,\n&gt; \n&gt; Can we just go to a file size limit?  Anything over 50 or 100kb has \n&gt; to be linked to?  This way we will cut down on the file strain \n&gt; without having to convert to mp3.  Many of the mp3 files are \nmassive \n&gt; here.  My wav files are smaller...plus the mp3s don&#39;t open up \n&gt; correctly for some of us.\n&gt; \n&gt; I requested this yesterday, but it surely got lost in the \nfireworks.  \n&gt; I have deleted some of my files, as well.  \n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;lisbyfarrum&quot; &lt;lisby@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Deleting my files took it down about 3 percent, I noticed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, I have been sick and I&#39;m plain worn down to a nub with all \nthis\n&gt; &gt; fighting.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do appreciate you asking after me, Misty. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll be around.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Misty&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks Ann. I think going to more compacted files will help us \n&gt; all in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the long run. We are already back to 72% rather than 96% tho \nmost \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the file space was being used by someone else besides you =)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I know it gets to be a bit testy around here and the other \n&gt; forums. I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; also know that some of the nastiness can tear apart good \nworking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; relationships as well as friendships. I was just askin Frank if \n&gt; he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; knew if you were still sick or not because you had been very \n&gt; quiet \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lately.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree sometimes its good to take a step back rather than get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yourself caught up in the drama fests going on around us all. \n&gt; Thats \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on and off the board as well. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I said I know some of what goes on off of this forum, and I \nam \n&gt; sad \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to see most of it happening. I just hope everyone can regain \n&gt; focus \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and like you said, remember why we are here.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope you feel better soon, and rejoin us when the stress \nlevel \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; passed. And I hope it passes soon so ya can run some test \n&gt; sessions \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the new tool that arrived!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I keep telling people that all the negativity does take a toll, \n&gt; on us \n&gt; &gt; &gt; personally and our working together. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Misty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Get a grip--all of you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m out of here until all this petty BS and hatred sorts out. \n&gt; The  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; amount of stress that I&#39;ve been through with all this \nfighting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; since  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; early this year has really taken a toll on me as a person and \n&gt; a  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researcher.
