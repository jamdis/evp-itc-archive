<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Everyone,

Below is information I received from a source online. Forgive me for not citing the website, it was an unknown user responding to a similar question. I couldn&#x27;t paste it all due to me posting this from my phone, but you will see what I mean. 

&quot;Sometimes it&#x27;s disease, sometimes pollution. Other times it&#x27;s just a mystery.
On average, 163 such events are reported to the federal government each year, according to USGS records. And there have been much larger die-offs than the 3,000 blackbirds in Arkansas. Twice in the summer of 1996, more than 100,000 ducks died of botulism in Canada.
Weather — cold and wet weather like in Arkansas New Year&#x27;s Eve when the birds fell out of the sky — is often associated with mass bird deaths, ornithologists say. Pollution, parasites and disease also cause mass deaths. Some are even blaming fireworks for the blackbird deaths.
So what&#x27;s happening this time?
Blame technology, says famed Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson. With the Internet, cell phones and worldwide communications, people are noticing events, connecting the dots more.&quot;
