I think we have all =\r\n experienced \nthe difficulty in hearing what is on  some of these recording=\r\ns: sometimes \nwe&#39;re not sure  at first what it says. Sometimes we ask other=\r\ns for  their \ninput.  Sometimes we only hear it once  someone else tells us=\r\n it first.  \nSometimes we  hear it wrong.  Sometimes we hear it right. And =\r\n so on.\n\nIt would be useful to know, as an  individual, how good we are at =\r\nhearing \nit right, so  we have some idea how trustworthy our skill, or  met=\r\nhods, or \ntechnology, is.  If we can measure  that, or even get a feel for =\r\nit, we can \nlook for  ways to improve it.  If we can&#39;t measure it,  then we=\r\n could be \nstuck.  \n\nSo, by  restricting the answers only to the timeframe =\r\nof the  experiment, \nwe can help filter out some of the  problems of subjec=\r\ntivity: for example, \none theory is  that people can hear what they want to=\r\n hear, or can  these \nsounds in a certain way, once you already know  the a=\r\nnswer.  Or, given 2 ways to \nhear a sound,  being influenced, even subconsc=\r\niously, to hear it  one way \nover the other.  We want to rule that  out.\n\nT=\r\nhis is one reason we can only count on  answers given during the \ntimeframe=\r\n.  That is  when the answer is most objective.  Once the  object has been \n=\r\nannounced, we move into a   period where we can&#39;t discount possible influen=\r\nce  \nfrom already knowing the answer.\n\nBut, I am  confident that if a perso=\r\nn&#39;s method or technology  really can \nreveal the correct answer outside the=\r\n  timeframe, then doing it within the \ntimeframe should  be just as easy, a=\r\nnd would then be a valid objective  result \nfor all to see.\n\n--- On Wed,  7=\r\n/14/10, SnowfireL@aol. com &lt;SnowfireL@aol.  com&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom:  SnowfireL@=\r\naol. com &lt;SnowfireL@aol.  com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Experiment  20100710 =\r\n- RESULTS!\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups  .com\nDate: Wednesday, July 14, 2010, 2:=\r\n50  PM\n\n\n \nit  doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s in the whole file, I didn&#39;t  think it w=\r\nas possible \nto have a radio sit on top  of a pc screen i guess.
