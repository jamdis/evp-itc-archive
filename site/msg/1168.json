The color image \nhalfway \n&gt; down the page is similar to what I witnessed along with several \nother \n&gt; people during a meditation excercise that was the lead in to a \n&gt; dimensional portal building workshop.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank, when you mentioned the &quot;purples&quot; to me while I was in CO, I \n&gt; immediately thought of my experience but your description was \n&gt; different. My encounter was with a mantis head being.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards, Bill Murphy\n&gt; \n&gt; p.s. we&#39;ve been operating and recording some box sessions. During \nour \n&gt; first sessions, the box seemed to be calling your name like it did \nwhen \n&gt; we visited you. Through verbally stated intention, I communicated \nthat \n&gt; you have provided me with the box for continued research. Our last \ntwo \n&gt; sessions began by my name being announced by the box. It&#39;s almost \nas if \n&gt; the spirit technicians (or etheral beings) now recognize my energy \n&gt; signature being imprinted in this particular box.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ken Thomas &lt;kennnthomas2000@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.unknowncountry.com/news/?id=6132\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
