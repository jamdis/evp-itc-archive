<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>When I first &quot;got&quot; the idea for the box, using a chamber was poionted out
to me kinda telepathicly. It seems to function as a space where the sound
can be manipulated easier by the entities, and using different materials
seems to get different levels. When I use aluminum, that seems to facilitate
ET contact more often than not using the chamber. Using pipe helps make the
chambers smaller. Thre seems to be a filtering effect by the chamber that
tends to enhance the voices. Most of the boxes I make have an option to use
the chambers.

 The mind contact that poined out the chamber--I think--was that shadow guy
on the group home page.

&gt; Frank, do those pipes lessen the static a bit?  What is it used for?
