<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My long standing motto has been &quot;Eff &#x27;em if they can&#x27;t take a joke&quot;.  There are so many people faking evidence and no one calls them out for it.  EVP is electronic voice PHENOMENA.  It&#x27;s up to the listener to decide what is, where it comes from and what it means.  Ultimately, there&#x27;s no way to know where the messages are coming from or what is being conveyed.  It&#x27;s just there.  

I also agree that who says ghosts, spirits, aliens, whatever can&#x27;t have a sense of humor?  I know that if I were out there &quot;haunting&quot; someplace and had any say about it, I&#x27;d be doing silly things.  I&#x27;ve often said to my husband that if he outlives me and weird stuff starts happening, it&#x27;s me messing with him.  

I understand your anger, though.  Why is it that in certain fields and areas of interst that everyone is an &quot;expert&quot;.  I&#x27;m the first one to admit I&#x27;m a newbie.  I&#x27;m skeptical, but find paranormal research fascinating.

As for the people who want your inventions, I say... &quot;Make your own&quot;!  It&#x27;s one thing for someone to recreate something that&#x27;s already been created, but quite another to want something for nothing (and then use it for personal gain as well).

&gt;  I was on the group My Para, supposedly a social network for paranormal

&gt; EVPs, and apparently got banned from the group for that. I have had enough
&gt; of every friggin&#x27; idiot with a computer trying to be the worlds only
&gt; EVP/Paranormnal expert, thinking they can judge what&#x27;s real evidence. I
&gt; absolutely refuse to make anymore boxes so some egomanic dweeb can set
&gt; themselves up as the big expert.

&gt;  This mostly falls on deaf ears, cuz everyone out there is too busy trying
&gt; to be TAPS, and chasing limelights, not ghosts, and certainly not any
&gt; knowledge!
