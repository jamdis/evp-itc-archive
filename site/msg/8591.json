That was a manual sweep using a Duracell KP028 emergency radio/flashlight.  \nThe total session was about 30 seconds.   I highly recommend this unit to anyone \ninterested in working with manual sweep.  It&#39;s comfortable in the hand, really easy to turn \nthe dial, and comes in a twin-pack for about $30 (including shipping) from places like \nAmazon and eBay.   \n\nI do own both the old and new Radio Shack models 12-469, and the old 12-470.  While I \nhave gotten good results with all of them, for me, there is no comparison in message \nlength and clarity that I have received using the Duracell, so it is my preferred &#39;sweep&#39; \nunit.\n\nI also have a MiniBox, which is a unique creature, unlike any of the radios.  ;0)\n\nThanks so much for listening and the feedback!\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Michael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; That was very clear Margaret!\n&gt;    \n&gt;   What Ghost box do you have?\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Mike Edwards Cary NC\n&gt; \n&gt; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;           \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt; File : /Margaret Downey/Radio Sweep - Manual/ArthurTheTech.mp3 \n&gt; Uploaded by : itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; \n&gt; Description : I&#39;ve been a little leery about the new tech, Arthur from EVP Maker, so I \nwanted to see what my trusted tech tech team had to say about him.
