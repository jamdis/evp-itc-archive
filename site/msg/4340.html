Spam = irrelevant posts from "members" that have nothing to do with this research. Or if you only post one message and its always to draw people to your money making gimmick/show... Frank S. might ban you hehehe
   
  Mikes not trying to make any money of you guys (to my knowledge hes been very giving), its definitely relative to whats been being discussed here...so I dont see any problem with it.
   
  Free help/info/ideas to benefit each others research is what this group is about. Breathe deeply and move on to the next post if you dont like what someone posts. Let the mods decide what is or isn't spam.

          Jon, 

Posting a link to relevant information is not spam with respect to 
ITC - especially radio programs that are invaluable. Many here are 
trying to glean as much understanding of the technologies from as 
many knowledgable sources as possible. If someone were to post links 
to Viagra, The Lottery, etc., then I would agree with you. Geesh...
