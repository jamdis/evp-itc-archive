<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hummmm, and yet you think this group is somhow more honest and open? I 
was just wondering why yet another attempt at production was seemingly 
derailed, by get this--group members!? Or was it an outside influance? 
I wonder if any of these groups is worth the trouble. I already keep
