<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just curious, what specific info might you know about problems with QM event. I ponied up some serious cash and am selling half my hobby goods for travel money, so I would naturally be interested in specifics. Darkness events has an excellent conference track record, and I know they just redressed the QM event with new graphics just last week. Also there is an agreement in place for special room rates, so it looks like all is good on location side.

Dang right I will be checking with promoter before driving halfway across country, lol.

I think with the TAPSCON 2 fiasco, folks may just be getting paranoid. Thankfully this isn&#x27;t an odyssey star production, lol...

&gt; 
&gt; I think a lecture on the REAL history of the ghost boxes would be very well
&gt; attended especially at the Queen Mary. Just because your name is so 
&gt; attached to the technology, I think people would want to hear what you have
&gt; to say.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that teaching a course per se in how to build one might be a little
&gt; frustrating without the students having the proper background. Not quite 
&gt; sure how to crack that nut to be honest.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, my intel says that the QM event may or may not go, so if you should 
&gt; decideyou want to do it be sure to recheck with the coorindator.
