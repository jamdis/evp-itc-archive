(I found their burial records, though their graves were unmarked, and the burial info led to census records, etc.)\n\nAnyway, if your voice has a fairly distinctive name (given name + surname) and a related location, let me know.  (The order of importances:  Full name, then location, and then -- way down the list -- the era/year.  I cannot work with just name + year; I must have a likely location.)\n\nI&#39;m happy to do some quick (and free) research, as time permits, to confirm whether (or not) those people actually exist in historical records.\n\nI think it would be very cool to show that these names are real, and what they&#39;re saying fits their histories in our world.  \n\n(I&#39;m qualifying that -- saying &quot;in our world&quot; -- because I think many voices and &quot;ghosts&quot; are actually alive and well, but in their own parallel/alternate worlds.)\n\nSend serious inquiries to: fiona -at- hollowhill.com\n\nCheerfully,\nFiona"}
