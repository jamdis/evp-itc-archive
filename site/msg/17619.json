It&#39;s not just the boxes, these &quot;rational thinkers&quot; want all free\nthinking to go away. That is what I find so infuriating. It&#39;s all this pure\nscience BS, how many thousands die every year from drugs tested by good\nscience, how many die every year being denied treatments that work because\nit goes against science. How long did cigarette companies rely on good\nscience to show smoking is good for you. You can get any result you pay for\nwith science. Science is nothing but dogma and egos--in this society.\n\n I could understand someone saying they tested to boxes and all they heard\nwas broadcast fragments, or gibberish, or a mix of the above along --with\nsome stuff that is not supposed to be there. But to just flat out claim they\nhear nothing!, what? are they frikkin&#39; deaf!? Two ways to hear nothing, put\nthe broken radio in a faraday cage, blocking all signals, or never turn the\nthing on! It&#39;s the ignore all facts and statements of live witnesses, stuff\nthat stands up in any court, and then claim they are somehow superior.\nThat&#39;s the freaking NAZIs, the darkside, pure evil!\n\n F-S\n\nOn Thu, Jun 10, 2010 at 7:07 AM, April Abercrombie &lt;\napril@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You have nothing to worry about there Frank.

As usual, igonore all facts and all other methods, such as\n&gt;&gt;&gt; EVPmaker, which forms all the voices inside the computer. Ignore all phone\n&gt;&gt;&gt; EVP messages, ignore all voices heard with no electronic aids. Ignore\n&gt;&gt;&gt; messages received via turned off TV and printers--and on and on, yet they\n&gt;&gt;&gt; know all about EVP..Ignore the fact that probably thousands use boxes\n&gt;&gt;&gt; successfully.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep EVP\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and the results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; such devices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how EVP\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and visual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without solid\n&gt;&gt;&gt; research supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; recommend it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies\n&gt;&gt;&gt; conducted by experienced researchers that shows it does produce phenomena,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; we would gladly promote it as an alternative technique.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; We are pretty sure that, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the voice\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is formed in the electronics by transforming available audio-frequency noise\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in an active part of the electronics such as a transistor junction. We think\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the process is amplification of a weak telekinetic signal via stochastic\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resonance and we have found that the optimum audio-frequency signal for this\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is a chaotic one rich in voice-frequencies with many transient perturbation.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; That is our working hypothesis. &quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  I can&#39;t say who this is from, cuz almost certain I&#39;d get sued. There&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;&gt; no double blind testing their BS either.

I love these so called\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experts that tell us that we can only make contact using their exact methods\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and we need to refrain from any other way of doing research because in their\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eyes were just spinning our wheels. So we can&#39;t get communication from\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; modified radios and were all just hearing what we want I guess.
