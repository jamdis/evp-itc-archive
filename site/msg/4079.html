<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Please update us if you are able to interface the USB radio to your
computer and scan frequencies using software. That approach could make
things easier for many people.

&gt; Hello everyone - Bill here.  Been facinated with EVPs on C2C for 
&gt; years and a few days ago realized that I have a room full of high end 
&gt; audio and video recording equipment, 4 computers and software to do 
&gt; anything with anything...Hey!  I can set something up to do EVPs!  
&gt; I&#x27;ve got a starter set on my desktop that worked on the first try 
&gt; and &quot;Rick&quot; (my contact)has been helpful in getting it fine tuned. 
&gt; Desktop setup uses EVPmaker chewing up a 1 minute segment of a man 
&gt; giving a talk, with white noise (EVP said &quot;use that noise&quot;)in a loop 
&gt; on Soundbooth.  I use a AKG 414 mike about 18&quot; from the computer 
&gt; speakers and simply lean over it to ask questions, and record on to 
&gt; Audition. 
&gt;    My next move is to create a laptop based system using as few 
&gt; components as possible. I&#x27;m looking at the RadioShark 2 USB am/fm 
&gt; radio, and hoping to leave it &quot;stock&quot; and have it scan using 
&gt; software.  I&#x27;ve found some 3rd party software that might work, but 
&gt; don&#x27;t know the particulars of the &quot;scan&quot; function.  Anybody here gone 
&gt; this route or know of software that will work?  My portable sytem 
&gt; would be the laptop, Radio Shark 2, and a microphone-and maybe a 
&gt; Logitec external speaker.  Play white noise and radio scan thru 
&gt; speakers, record back on computer.  Whaddya think?
&gt;    Started my listening career in teh 1960&#x27;s building Knight kit 
&gt; shortwave radios, and still enjoy Shortwave listening - utilites 
&gt; mostly.  EVP seems like the next level.
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Bill
