And I \nwill have to say it&#39;s nice to see you getting your son coming thru \nthere as well as others! Hopefully they will share what you gave them.\n\nMisty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  Well, I had a good time, did several talks, and--get this! An \ninvestigation. Or rather I kinda tagged along on a group&#39;s \ninvestigation and used one of the boxes. There was entities answering \nquestions, and responding tot he group members. I gave the group the \ntape, so I won&#39;t be able able to play those. On my own recordings, \nthe spirits were pretty the same as  get at home, and even my son \ncome through wiht &quot;My father did this&quot;, which I played for a larger \ngroup. I loaned a box to another group, and they also got entities to \nanswer questions, and interact. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  RoboBox did perform for a group, with at least one meaningful \ncomment. A woman came to the table afte the talk, and asked &quot; Do they \nonokly talk for you&quot;&quot;, and immediately RoboBox put out &quot;for you&quot;, \nfollowed after a few seconds &quot;Loves to cook&quot;, the woman was a cook!\n&gt;  \n&gt;  The whole thing is very energy intense. \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; In a rush?
