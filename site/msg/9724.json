Within Lord Shiva&#39;s dancing  \nmanifestation is represented not only all of time and space, but also  \nthe primal creative force that is beyond the circle of illusion that  \nmortals live within, all movement and vibration of the universe, and  \nthe stillness beyond all existence. Shiva is the turning and churning  \ncosmos, but also only an aspect and channeler of a higher frequency-- \nAum, which perhaps is the divine frequency, or in other words, &quot;God.&quot;\n\nThe metaphysics and advanced physics expressed by the Shiva symbology  \nis stunning.\n\nAnn\n\nOn Apr 14, 2008, at 5:44 PM, Kristin wrote:\n\n&gt; now if anyone can actually hear it besides me it would be nice ...\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been trying to get clarity about the number 7 and today&#39;s\n&gt; message was unusual.\n&gt;\n&gt; I asked them what the number 7 meant to them and in reply I heard:\n&gt; DONT FAKE...  THE FIRST SON...  SHIVA JUSTICE...  THE SPIRIT (or could\n&gt; be DESPERATE).. THAT&#39;S ALL.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know what the first son probably refers to.. and I have heard of\n&gt; Shiva but never &#39;Shiva Justice&#39;.. so I looked that up and this is what\n&gt; I found in reference to the definition of Shiva Justice:\n&gt;\n&gt; from:  http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Siva_Shiva/id/137936\n&gt;\n&gt; Siva, Shiva (Sanskrit) The third god of the Hindu Trimurti (trinity):\n&gt; Brahma the evolver; Vishnu the preserver; and Siva the regenerator or\n&gt; destroyer.\n&gt;\n&gt; Siva is one of the three loftiest divinities of our solar system, and\n&gt; in his character of destroyer stands higher than Vishnu for he is &quot;the\n&gt; destroying deity, evolution and PROGRESS personified, who is the\n&gt; regenerator at the same time; who destroys things under one form but\n&gt; to recall them to life under another more perfect type&quot; (SD 2:182).\n&gt;\n&gt; As the destroyer of outward forms he is called Vamadeva.  Endowed  \n&gt; with so\n&gt; many powers and attributes, Siva possesses a great number of names,\n&gt; and is represented under a corresponding variety of forms. He\n&gt; corresponds to the Palestinian Ba`al or Moloch, Saturn, the Phoenician\n&gt; El, the Egyptian Seth, and the Biblical Chiun of Amos, and Greek  \n&gt; Typhon.\n&gt;\n&gt; Siva is known under more than a thousand names or titles and is\n&gt; represented under many different forms in Hindu writings. As the god\n&gt; of generation and of justice, he is represented riding a white bull;\n&gt; his own color, as well as that of the bull, is generally white,\n&gt; referring probably to the unsullied purity of abstract justice. He is\n&gt; sometimes seen with two hands, sometimes with four, eight, or ten; and\n&gt; with five faces, representing among other things his power over the\n&gt; five elements.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;In the Rig Veda the name Siva is unknown, but the god is called\n&gt; Rudra, which is a word used for Agni, the fire god . . .&quot;; &quot;In the\n&gt; Vedas he is the divine Ego aspiring to return to its pure, deific\n&gt; state, and at the same time that divine ego imprisoned in earthly\n&gt; form, whose fierce passions make of him the &#39;roarer,&#39; the &#39;terrible&#39; &quot;\n&gt; (SD 2:613, 548).\n&gt;\n&gt; Siva is often spoken of as the patron deity of esotericists,\n&gt; occultists, and ascetics; he is called the Mahayogin (the great\n&gt; ascetic), from whom the highest spiritual knowledge is acquired, and\n&gt; union with the great spirit of the universe is eventually gained. Here\n&gt; he is &quot;the howling and terrific destroyer of human passions and\n&gt; physical senses, which are ever in the way of the development of the\n&gt; higher spiritual perceptions and the growth of the inner eternal man\n&gt; -- mystically . . . Siva-Rudra is the Destroyer, as Vishnu is the\n&gt; preserver; and both are the regenerators of spiritual as well as of\n&gt; physical nature. To live as a plant, the seed must die. To live as a\n&gt; conscious entity in the Eternity, the passions and senses of man must\n&gt; first die before his body does. &#39;To live is to die and to die is to\n&gt; live,&#39; has been too little understood in the West. Siva, the\n&gt; destroyer, is the creator and the Saviour of Spiritual man, as he is\n&gt; the good gardener of nature. He weeds out the plants, human and\n&gt; cosmic, and kills the passions of the physical, to call to life the\n&gt; perceptions of the spiritual, man&quot; (SD 1:459&n).\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nThe e's one mo e aspec o Shi a ha ough o be men ioned: Na a aj-- he one whose dance u ns he uni e se.
