Hi David. Welcome to the group. Sorry to hear you have a neg attached to you, but I believe you can get rid of them for the most part. 
   
  I have links to some free software on my website http://misty.xm.com
   
  The site is a work in progress always but just click on software to get where ya wanna go. I like audacity and clear voice denoiser the best. We look forward to more posts from you in the future.

          I have been recording evp's for over 3 years now and I think I have 
heard it all, from a little girl that was raped " tore my cloths 
off", "I was very scared" then " I died in the snow" to the same voice 
that cusses me out every time I record. Now Im looking for a free or 
very cheap audio program to help clean the recordings up to make them 
clearer. any suggestions? thanks.
