<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The photographer Fred Picker, when he was still alive and owned Zone VI
Studios, offered equipment of his own manufacture with a lifetime warranty.
It was more expensive than others&#x27; similar equipment but was a higher
quality, IMO. Truck run over your Zone VI view camera? He&#x27;d replace it, no
questions asked.

I think Calumet Photo still honors the lifetime warranties of the Zone VI
stuff. Hopefully they don&#x27;t lose too much money on it. I know offering any
sort of support for a product gets expensive.

&gt; After listening to my friend Rich&#x27;s suggestion, i decided to make available
&gt; some of my
&gt; boxes for sale on my site. I will probably be offering several hacks and
&gt; test
&gt; pieces as i progress with my work. I have so many boxes now, i need to get
&gt; rid
&gt; of some.
&gt;
&gt; I know the price may be steep, but i&#x27;m considering the tech support i have
&gt; to
&gt; offer and possibly having to fix them over and over again. I figured i
&gt; would
&gt; show you guys. I&#x27;m not in this to make money, but just enough to fund
&gt; some new projects. It all goes back into the research.
