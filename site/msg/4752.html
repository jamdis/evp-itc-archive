Frank, I've been impressed with your work since I was first made aware of i=
t several years ago.  I didn't mean to infer there was a problem with the b=
ox, but rather was questioning the interpretation of the person using it.  =
You're anything but a failure, and my inability to hear what he hears is ce=
rtainly no reflection on you.  I've heard amazing stuff out of your contrap=
tions, so I know it's real and it works.  So much of this is subjective tho=
ugh.  The one EVP I consider my most profound success is inaudible to every=
one I've played it for.  Sometimes I feel like I'll go crazy because it's s=
o absolutely clear to me--How is it possible that no one else can hear it??=
  I also agree that the most success in this field will come from good inte=
ntions and a pure heart, because this is spiritual work as much as it is sc=
ientific.  Just wanted to say I appreciate and admire you.

Robin

      Frank,
      To someone that we all look up to as an inspera=
tion I can say that you can make the best box ever and the results might ju=

      Keep working in thi=

t in the darkness!  There will always be people that will try to rain on OU=

is not about us!  Its about TRUTH and the light and research.  Thanks for e=
verything you have done and continue to do!!
      I think personally that =
these devices work best when the user is not using the device for personal =
gain, but for everyones best intrests!!

      Happy New Year!
