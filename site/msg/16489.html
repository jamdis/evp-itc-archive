Frank =E2=80=93 thanks for participating in the test discussions.



I am n=
ot running the tests, but I am going to try to participate, even if it is o=
nly giving my input, as much as I can. =C2=A0I envision =E2=80=9CObjective =
Listeners=E2=80=9D to be people who are not trying to prove, or disprove, t=
he theories either way. I envision the tests being developed to help them b=
e objective: for example, maybe one group of people ask questions, but a di=
fferent group listen to the recordings without knowing the questions, and t=
ry to hear the answers. =C2=A0Maybe that would help control for questions l=
eading what you hear (for example, asking a YES/NO question might predispos=
e someone to hearing a YES or NO in the noise). =C2=A0While everyone may he=
ar different, maybe they won=E2=80=99t. =C2=A0Maybe a large enough group of=
 people will show a higher percentage giving one answer over another. =C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0Any if no one hears the same thing, that could also be signi=
ficant, and raise the question how anyone could have any confidence that wh=
at they hear, is what is on the
 tape? =C2=A0I think these are all interest=
ing possibilities, hence my interest in the tests.



You are probably righ=
t that there are supposed objective scientists out there, and those adherin=
g to their own dogma over pure science. I think that is a potential failing=
 of people in general: religious people can focus on dogma over reason, sci=
ence can focus on dogma over reason, believers can focus on dogma over reas=
on, skeptics can focus on dogma over reason. =C2=A0Left alone, they don=E2=
=80=99t grow out of this. =C2=A0That=E2=80=99s why it is always important, =
for those who understand the dangers of this kind of close-minded dogma, to=
 support testing and critical thinking, and to involve themselves in tests =
to not only challenge traditional beliefs, but challenge beliefs of their o=
wn.



So I thinks it=E2=80=99s great that you and all of us here are parti=
cipating in these discussions, and that you=E2=80=99ve gone the extra mile =
to support this testing by lending your box to the researchers. =C2=A0And o=
f course, the more people who are informed with the workings and potential =
of this technology being involved, the better the test environment will be,=
 and the less chance for subjective-errors to creep in. =C2=A0The better th=
e tests, the better the chance that theories and beliefs that are wrong, wi=
ll be shown to be wrong. And those that are right, shown to all to be right=
.



Again, I will be sure to keep everyone informed, and hope that anyone =
else who wants to participate will do so.
