<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi guys!  I didn&#x27;t receive any response to my last question, and maybe that&#x27;s because everyone is busy with real life and whatnot.  I know some of you were out of town, so I thought I&#x27;d post my question again, hoping someone will be kind enough to offer his or her infinite wisdom and opinions.

What is a &quot;tech,&quot; and is it desirable to have one?  Is this like a helper on the other side? I&#x27;ve tried googling this, but haven&#x27;t found anything about this anywhere. 

Do you guys find that it&#x27;s better to do short sessions (15 minutes) or long ones (two hours)?  Do the entities get exhausted quickly, or do they have to get going and need time to do it?

Thanks in advance for you answers!

Jill</pre>
