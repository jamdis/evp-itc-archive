<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Probably because he wants to stay in his own little world and just say 
that it could&#x27;ve been faked, while ignoring the circumstances anyone 
presents.  He won&#x27;t take anyone&#x27;s word that circumstances indicate an EVP 
couldn&#x27;t have been faked.

Maybe someone should have HIM set up the experiment in a haunted place and 
see if any EVP are gotten. I don&#x27;t think that has been done (maybe it has 
but I don&#x27;t know of any).

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m sure lots of you know who James Randi is, the skeptic who offers $1
&gt; million for proof of the paranormal.
&gt;
&gt; I am wondering why there hasn&#x27;t been an EVP demonstration good enough
&gt; to win the prize. I have never captured an EVP, but many people have
&gt; including those in this group. I cannot say (like James Randi
&gt; apparently and others like him) that I think every person who captured
&gt; an EVP is a fraud or captured a fluke or something like that. I don&#x27;t
&gt; think that at all, it appears to me that many of them are the real
&gt; deal, of that I am almost 100% certain and will be 100% certain if I
&gt; can ever capture my own.
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t know a lot about James Randi or EVP for that matter, but it is
&gt; a question that came up. Can anyone enlighten me?
&gt;
&gt; I tried a few sessions last night but came up empty handed. I am
&gt; starting to think my white noise isn&#x27;t loud enough. I&#x27;m going to keep
&gt; trying.
&gt;
&gt; Also I hope to experiment with ITC images. And soon I want to build
&gt; a &quot;box&quot; which I keep hearing so much about. I don&#x27;t know the first
&gt; thing about these ghost/spirit boxes as I&#x27;ve heard them called, all I
&gt; know is I want to learn to build one and use it as I&#x27;ve heard some
&gt; interesting audio files here. But that&#x27;s probably a good subject for a
&gt; separate post unless anyone can give me an informative how-to link or
&gt; anything.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Angela
