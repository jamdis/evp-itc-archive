<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hellooooo :) Have we all forgotten how &quot;mediums&quot; were popping up everywhere back then ;) It was big money. There were always FAKES to be found :) Why waste your energy (spirit)on blowing a silly trumpet if you could just use your ecto-vocal cords :) to tell ALL. I&#x27;m sure they would want to &quot;tell&quot; us where they were, and how they reach us instead of doing the AMAZING trumpet playing :) Voicing back then would be expected to have these answers...it was easier to draw paying customers with just &quot;tricks&quot;. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:

&gt; Hey there, stop that April, hehe, way back spirit use to materialize vocal  
&gt; cords, if given enough ectoplasm and they could speak out in mid air, or 
&gt; use a  metal trumpet like thing, I have an old banged up one, im going to use 
&gt; it today  with the RS 125, and see what happens, put it inside the lower end 
&gt; of the  trumpet, with the mic, near the PC and let them talk away, the PC 
&gt; does the  recording, it might help them, who knows until it&#x27;s tried.  they 
&gt; use to  form cords inside the trumpet out of this substance  called  ectoplasm 
&gt; and talk independently like that one time.

&gt; try to combine them some how, and see what happens, maybe put some  light 
&gt; wires  inside the box near where the vibration comes out?   Don&#x27;t see how a 
&gt; crystal helps, it&#x27;s just glass, and there is no where for  them to create 
&gt; ectoplasm like threads on glass, try two tiny wires, (I see  u, stop laughing).

&gt; There was speaking machines back in the 1800s that had  mechanical vocal 
&gt; cords. It still seems easiest for them to manipulate the  electrical signals 
&gt; though.

&gt; Frank do you think it&#x27;s similar to what was used in 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s  by 
&gt; mediums, where a trumpet (long piece of aluminum metal cone light  weight shaped 
&gt; device) was used, it was a form spirit to form  their own vocal cords in mid 
&gt; air.  Perhaps, you should set up a  test, try asking something of the 
&gt; spirit that you do not know, where it  could be verified later, that way it won&#x27;t 
&gt; have any physical  influence.  I remember voices easily, it&#x27;s the work I 
&gt; do, so I do  recognize my mother&#x27;s voice, I do think you are all onto some 
&gt; thing  here, which should one day be as the air plane, who every thought humans 
&gt;  would one day fly?  Try some light weight metal object in the box,  maybe 
&gt; it would help, maybe shaped like a pair of vocal cords, with  folds see it 
&gt; that helps. sf

&gt; I make the boxes and I don&#x27;t know, it seems to be a  natural ability that 
&gt; most spirits have. Thoughts can interact with the  electronics, and even 
&gt; &quot;voices&quot; of the living can come through, in that  way I think we can create what 
&gt; we are expecting to hear. 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; When I first started making this stuff, I gort my wifes  &quot;voice&quot; as she was 
&gt; stepping in the shower, upstairs, &quot;I&#x27;ll be out in  two minutes&quot;, in her 
&gt; voces, throught he box. It&#x27;s seems to be more  difficult to conciously form 
&gt; voices, kinda like doing PK, it&#x27;s more of  a subconcious function. Of course 
&gt; that was with the radnom sweep,  linear sweep seems to work a little 
&gt; differently, and seems to take  more ability, or effort. 
&gt;  
&gt;  The voices seem to made inside the electronics, you can  record with no 
&gt; sound output, and still get the same kind of results.  Even that could support 
&gt; that suggestion that it&#x27;s imagination, in that  we&#x27;d still hear the same 
&gt; stuff in the chopped up audio, not that I  believe that. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Someone needs to study this stuff that hasn&#x27;t already made  up their minds 
&gt; what it is.

&gt; Hi, I have a question for those who use a box instead of radio,  where do 
&gt; spirit get the ability to talk with a box?  Are there  certain channels going 
&gt; by with the box as is like a radio?  sf
