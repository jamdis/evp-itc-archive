<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Myself, though I am a spiritual being having my own personal beliefs,  
wouldn&#x27;t give much, if any, credit to mediums in this area of  
research. A large percentage of the time, mediums information is in  
error. I&#x27;m not saying that mediums can&#x27;t be of assistance, but I&#x27;d not  
base fact on their &quot;abilities&quot;.

Since this list is for the research of EVP &amp; ITC, I tend to give  
credit to what I can hear/record via various equipment, my own  
experiences, physics, and other solid data, not simply what I&#x27;m told  
via others. Those combined with my own experiences in recording is  
what holds water in my opinion. Spiritualism, in my opinion, in this  
area of research, would be considered by the scientific community as  
heresay as well as lacking in the area of burden of proof. I simply  
refuse (myself) to base my own beliefs on what others say, but strive  
to prove what I experience via what others can hear/see... solid  
evidence - not heresay that I don&#x27;t agree with for various reasons  
already stated in earlier posts.
