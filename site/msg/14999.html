<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Fascinating! I&#x27;ve had this idea that the EVP are often not recorded by the
microphone but somehow make their way in at the actual point where the
storage is made, whether it be analog (tape) or digital.
So much we don&#x27;t know ...

&gt;  I monitor my audio live. The funny thing is that even so, those last
&gt; EVP&#x27;s I captured I did not hear either in the environment, or on my
&gt; recording as it happened. I only heard them upon playback.

&gt;  I am curious if anyone with a microphone wired to a remote site has ever
&gt; gotten any EVP in real time.
&gt;
&gt; I took part in an investigation of Ashmore Estates, near Ashmore IL, on
&gt; Saturday night. We had six video cameras set up in the three halls of the
&gt; building. The video for all was being monitored and recorded at a central
&gt; location. Alas, we did not have microphones at the camera sites conected to
&gt; the central location. I wonder what we might have heard if we did?
