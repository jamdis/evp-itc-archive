<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am not sure about the Flutes, but they sure do sound cool even if they are
feedback.  Looks like you created a synthesizer!

In your other files, there is plenty of communication though.

(NormalOp-1)
.03 - A woman says &quot;hello people (? or purple ?)&quot;
.05 - A man &quot;press that ? back ?&quot;
.10 - A man &quot;Ask him those questions it means that we&#x27;ll ? give up ? &quot;
.14 - A man &quot;You should talk to Frank&quot;

(NormalOp-2)
.12 - A man &quot;Yeah, put over it&quot;  - This happens after you replace the lid!
.14 - A man &quot;Hello&quot;

&gt;  Not sure what this flute sound is. The sweep hung up, and put AM reception
&gt; down below the band--I think. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s a weird feedback signal, as
&gt; it was only audible in the echo chamber. Could it be an amazing example of
&gt; spirit communication, naw, I think it much more mundane. It was after I put
&gt; the top cover on, so my vote is feedback notes.
&gt;
&gt;  This is not intended to reflect on any other systems out there, real or
&gt; imagined, only my own work is in question.
