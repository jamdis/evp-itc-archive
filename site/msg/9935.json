Apparently there&#39;s patent \nstuff involved, but it&#39;s supposed to be coming out. \n\n To me, there seems to be a few on this group that want to be the big \nexperts, the go to guys, and make alot of claims. Just keep in mind \nthat the real brainiacs in the field tend to stay off groups for this \nreason. \n\n It&#39;s curious that someone that claims to be complete ignoramous when \nit comes to technology claims to have been researching a highly \ntechnical aspect of this research for several months. I&#39;m trying not to \nbe the bitch, but the claws are coming out. \n\n Frank"}
