It happened throughout the entire investigation, though not consistent in t=
iming, volume, or rhythm. The only thing consistent was the EMF spikes ever=
ything a tap would occur.

  No this was a constant re=
cording. This was caught in an empty room on my camcorder footage, as well =
as on some other recording devices. 

  That coupled with the EMF spikes at=
 the same time confirm that it was in the house, not in the machinery. If i=
t is a static discharge, something is still causing it. But it doesn't soun=
d like a static discharge. I say tap, but it is more of a sharp pop.  I am =
attaching a clip of the sound if you want to hear it.

  This went on const=
antly throughout the entire time we were there, about 4 hours.

          It could: if you've ever noticed the tap sound when star=
ting or stopping a recording session, assuming it is not being caused by pu=
shing a switch in the mic, the tap or pop you hear can be caused by the ele=
ctronics as it begins to ceases recording.

          Also a static charge =
can cause the pop.

                    Yes.  Also faulty wiring, which is e=
ven more dangerous.
                    Also with flakey transformers or ot=

                    Per=

                      Hi All,

                      Is there som=
eone here that can answer and electrical question for me?

                =
      During the case that I recorded those possible EVP's-there was a loud=
 tapping noise that seemed to come from the 2nd bedroom. Upon checking my l=
ogs, every time one of  these clicks were heard, there would be an EMF spik=
e in the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livingroom downstairs=
. The home owners have also reported that they have a touch lamp that comes=
 on all the time by itself and the lights in the Kitchen will dim occasiona=
lly.

                      Now these taps are not consistent in timing, lo=
udness or rhythm. Could this be the work of faulty breakers?

             =
         Thanks!
                      April
