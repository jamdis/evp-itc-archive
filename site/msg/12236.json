This is quite a large group of genuine \nhelpful people however there are a few out there (you know who you \nare I wont name names) who think its ok to charge people money to do \na session for them in thier time of grief so please ignore anyone who \nwould even think about trying to solicit you or gain a profit off it. \n&gt; \n&gt; I personally frown upon that tactic.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are also many caring individuals in the community who may \nstep forward to try and be of assistance. At no charge. Just hoping \nanything could help your family. \n&gt; \n&gt; HUGGGZZZ\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 9/24/08, mamahaugs &lt;mamahaugs@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: mamahaugs &lt;mamahaugs@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] keep us in your thoughts\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Wednesday, September 24, 2008, 6:58 AM\n&gt; &gt; Hi I am newer to this sight I enjoy reading all your\n&gt; &gt; messages.
