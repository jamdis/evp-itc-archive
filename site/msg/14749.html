Gosh folks, I didn't mean to start a debate. I just wanted to share what I =
got from the prison. I think that the box technology is fantastic. Almost b=
eyond belief. I am not scientifically savvy as to how and why this technolo=
gy works, I just know that it does. I used to be a box skeptic, then someon=
e gave me one almost a year ago. I=A0conducted various experiments with it =
trying to determine if it produced random replys or intelligent, relivant c=
onversation. I have determined through my experiments that it produces the =
latter. I have since used it on many investigations, historical and residen=
