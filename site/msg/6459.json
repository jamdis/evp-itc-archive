I found the link I had mentioned. I&#39;m sure this will not be &#39;clickable&#39; because the link is too long for Yahoo posts like this one. You may have to cut and paste this into a browser. The title may come off sounding a bit negative, don&#39;t shoot the messanger :-).\nhttp://etheric-studies.aaevp.com/best_practices_development/index.phptitle=Locating_EVP_formation_and_detecting_false_positives\n\nDave\n\n--- lisby@... wrote:\n\nFrom: &quot;lisbyfarrum&quot; &lt;lisby@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Just A Little Spoiled\nDate: Tue, 29 Jan 2008 15:00:02 -0000\n\nWell, I&#39;m glad to hear it, but as of last week, the leaders were\nunreceptive to the idea that this phenomenon was real.\n\nAnn\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a radio sweep forum on AA-EVP for members.

And I agree with you about the overnight change.  \n&gt; Orgs like AA-EVP that aren&#39;t dealing with the boxes are missing the  \n&gt; boat.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jan 28, 2008, at 8:48 PM, Jules wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well guys, I have to tell you that since I started box sessions in\n&gt; &gt; November I have become so spoiled that conventional EVP just don&#39;t do\n&gt; &gt; it for me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My organization was asked to come and do an investigation at a very\n&gt; &gt; historial place (here in Illinois). The owner of this home asked if I\n&gt; &gt; would bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed with the\n&gt; &gt; immediately 2 way communication). So upon respectfully asking my tec\n&gt; &gt; if it was alright to do a session outside the my home we did several\n&gt; &gt; box sessions along with conventional EVP. We wanted to see if we could\n&gt; &gt; discover some unanswered history about the residence, and the  \n&gt; &gt; otherside\n&gt; &gt; was more than willing to comply.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were and are the\n&gt; &gt; most boring data to review. Something I use to love so much has\n&gt; &gt; actually turned into a project given I am waiting for a response\n&gt; &gt; immediately! Too funny how things can change overnight!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I will be uploading some files for these sessions if you are  \n&gt; &gt; interested.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Juli\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
