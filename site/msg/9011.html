Margaret, I can't argue with what you've said.  I'm just saying there are t=
hose who take advantage and should have no business in doing so.  One examp=
le I can give is Chris Moon.  He charges people to do box sessions.  I can'=
t remember the exact fee, but it's outrageous that he's doing this, not to =
mention, he does so with a Frank's box.  He is a self proclaimed medium and=
 I've heard from many sources that he is nothing but a fake.  

So I attrib=
ute my frustration with people of this type, but again I say, as long as th=
ere are people dumb enough to pay for this, then there will always be those=
 who take advantage.

Personally, I feel anyone who is gifted with mediumsh=
ip or other advanced intuitive abilities should use it as a gift to help ot=
hers, not for monetary gain.  I'm not being judgmental here, that's just ho=
w I feel.  I have a friend who is also a legitimate medium and I don't agre=
e that she should use her abilities for gain, but it doesn't mean I like he=
r any less.  My not liking it won't change the fact that it happens, it's j=
ust the way  things go.   

Do I think that Ron is taking advantage of peop=
le?  No I don't.  Ron says he uses the best parts available and that the co=
st of the Minibox is very close to what it costs to manufacture it.  How cl=
ose, I have no idea.  On the other hand, I don't own one as I think $399 or=
 $449 for the "crystal enhanced version," is a lot to pay for a device that=
, from what I've heard, produces the same results as a Radio Shack radio fo=
r $25-$40.

                Hi Jerem=
y.  If everyone knew about these support boards and that other resources ar=
e 
available to them, that would be one thing.  Obviously everyone here is =
aware of that.  But 
not everyone knows this place exists.  

And even if t=
hey do know about the boards here, how many would have the nerve to ask 
fo=
r help from strangers?  As Bruce recently shared, he gives people invitatio=
ns to contact 
him privately in case they are too shy just ask a question p=
ublicly.  Which means, by the 
way, to some degree they have overcome some =
of that shyness in order to post whatever it 
was to begin with, which insp=
ired him to make this offer.  What if they don't even have the 
gumption to=
 be anything more than be a look-i-loo?

I'm guessing many people are just =
surfing the net, checking out paranormal stuff, and run 
across the hacked =
boxes for sale.  

Again, I ask people who are taking the position you and =
Bruce are regarding profits ... do 
you have this same harsh sentiment towa=
rd Ron Ricketts, who makes and sells the 
MiniBoxes?  I realize he is passi=
onate about this research and helping others.  Does that 
give him amnesty =
for making a profit?  

Personally I think we need to not be so judgmental.=
  At what point does "profitable gain in 
the paranormal field" become "sic=
kening?"  I have a friend who is a medium.  I mean THE 
REAL DEAL.  He char=
ges for his services.   The fee is reasonable compared to many in his 
fiel=
d.  Does he do this because he's a terrible person looking to take advantag=
e of people?  
NO, he does so because he has been given a gift that changes=
 people's lives for the better.  
But he has to make a living... has to sup=
port himself in some way.  And because he has 
chosen to provide this servi=
ce full time (and is not a trust fund baby), he makes a profit.  
This allo=
ws him to help far more people than he could if working some other kind of =
job 
and providing his services at no cost on the side.  

I realize this i=
s not exactly the same thing as gouging people on the price for a 
commerci=
ally available product, but making such blanket statements about profitabil=
ity in 
the paranormal field being sickening is rather short-sighted, in my=
 opinion.  

I have a southern friend who likes to say, "It's a mighty thin=
 plank that ain't got two sides."  
I just don't think we have the right to=
 claim that simply because someone is offering a 
good and or service for p=
rofit to consumers in the paranormal market, that this 
automatically means=
 they are taking advantage of other's vulnerabilities.  

For Pete's sake, =
no one is twisting the people's arms to buy those units on eBay.  They are =

perfectly free to buy from whatever source they choose.  Since the units d=
o work as 
claimed, we can argue that people have overpaid, shopped unwisel=
y, or whatever.  I assure 
you this happens every single day throughout the=
 retail market place with all types of 
products and services.    

I will =
say I have a fairly heathy dose of distain for charlatans/scam artists (of =
any flavor in 
any field) but that is not what we are talking about here.  =
We are talking about people who 
are offering legitimate products to consum=
ers.  I'd rather see people doing this for profit, 
even when obscene, than=
 running scams that damage people's physical, mental, and/or 
financial wel=
l-being.

erif; font-size: 12pt;">Margaret, I can't argue with what you've said. =
; I'm just saying there are those who take advantage and should have no bus=
iness in doing so.  One example I can give is Chris Moon.  He cha=
rges people to do box sessions.  I can't remember the exact fee, but i=
t's outrageous that he's doing this, not to mention, he does so with a Fran=
k's box.  He is a self proclaimed medium and I've heard from many sour=
ces that he is nothing but a fake.  <br><br>So I attribute my frustrat=
ion with people of this type, but again I say, as long as there are people =
dumb enough to pay for this, then there will always be those who take advan=
tage.<br><br>Personally, I feel anyone who is gifted with mediumship or
 ot=
her advanced intuitive abilities should use it as a gift to help others, no=
t for monetary gain.  I'm not being judgmental here, that's just how I=
 feel.  I have a friend who is also a legitimate medium and I don't ag=
ree that she should use her abilities for gain, but it doesn't mean I like =
her any less.  My not liking it won't change the fact that it happens,=
 it's just the way  things go.   <br><br>Do I think that Ron is t=
aking advantage of people?  No I don't.  Ron says he uses the bes=
t parts available and that the cost of the Minibox is very close to what it=
 costs to manufacture it.  How close, I have no idea.  On the oth=
er hand, I don't own one as I think $399 or $449 for the "crystal enhanced =
version," is a lot to pay for a device that, from what I've heard, produces=
 the same results as a Radio Shack radio for $25-$40.  <br><br>Jeremy<=

    <div id=3D"ygrp-text">
            <p>Hi Jeremy.  If every=
one knew about these support boards and that other resources are <br>
avail=
able to them, that would be one thing.  Obviously everyone here is aware of=
 that.  But <br>
not everyone knows this place exists.  <br>
<br>
And even =
if they do know about the boards here, how many would have the nerve to ask=
 <br>
for help from strangers?  As Bruce recently shared, he gives people i=
nvitations to contact <br>
him privately in case they are too shy just ask =
a question publicly.  Which means, by the <br>
way, to some degree they hav=
e overcome some of that shyness in order to post whatever it <br>
was to be=
gin with, which inspired him to make this offer.  What if they don't even h=
ave the <br>
gumption to be anything more than be a look-i-loo?<br>
<br>
I'=
m guessing many people are just surfing the net, checking out paranormal st=
uff, and run <br>
across the hacked boxes for sale.  <br>
<br>
Again, I ask=
 people who are taking the position you and Bruce are regarding profits ...=
 do <br>
you have this same harsh sentiment toward Ron Ricketts, who makes =
and sells the <br>
MiniBoxes?  I realize he is passionate about this resear=
ch and helping others.  Does that <br>
give him amnesty for making a profit=
?  <br>
<br>
Personally I think we need to not be so judgmental.  At what p=
oint does "profitable gain in <br>
the paranormal field" become "sickening?=
"  I have a friend who is a medium.  I mean THE <br>
REAL DEAL.  He charges=
 for his services.   The fee is reasonable compared to many in his <br>
fie=
ld.  Does he do this because he's a terrible person looking to take advanta=
ge of people?  <br>
NO, he does so because he has been given a gift that ch=
anges people's lives for the better.  <br>
But he has to make a living... h=
as to support himself in some way.  And because he has <br>
chosen to provi=
de this service full time (and is not a trust fund baby), he makes a profit=
.  <br>
This allows him to help far more people than he could if working so=
me other kind of job <br>
and providing his services at no cost on the side=
.  <br>
<br>
I realize this is not exactly the same thing as gouging people=
 on the price for a <br>
commercially available product, but making such bl=
anket statements about profitability in <br>
the paranormal field being sic=
kening is rather short-sighted, in my opinion.  <br>
<br>
I have a southern=
 friend who likes to say, "It's a mighty thin plank that ain't got two side=
s."  <br>
I just don't think we have the right to claim that simply because=
 someone is offering a <br>
good and or service for profit to consumers in =
the paranormal market, that this <br>
automatically means they are taking a=
dvantage of other's vulnerabilities.  <br>
<br>
For Pete's sake, no one is =
twisting the people's arms to buy those units on eBay.  They are <br>
perfe=
ctly free to buy from whatever source they choose.  Since the units do work=
 as <br>
claimed, we can argue that people have overpaid, shopped unwisely,=
 or whatever.  I assure <br>
you this happens every single day throughout t=
he retail market place with all types of <br>
products and services.    <br=
>
<br>
I will say I have a fairly heathy dose of distain for charlatans/sca=
m artists (of any flavor in <br>
any field) but that is not what we are tal=
king about here.  We are talking about people who <br>
are offering legitim=
ate products to consumers.  I'd rather see people doing this for profit, <b=
r>
even when obscene, than running scams that damage people's physical, men=
tal, and/or <br>
financial well-being.  <br>
