I did some experiments using \n&gt; a &quot;box&quot;\n&gt; &gt; to scan a TV/VCR tuner, and got some interesting, but unverifiable\n&gt; &gt; images, such as the MIB guy on the group home page.

I am\n&gt; &gt; anxious to start ITC-EVP experimentation. I was looking over the\n&gt; &gt; photos section. Can someone explain to me what they represent and \n&gt; how\n&gt; &gt; and when the photos are taken. What is the procedure?Thanks much to\n&gt; &gt; all!Rita \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Connect and share in new ways with Windows Live.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.windowslive.com/connect.html?\n&gt; ocid=TXT_TAGLM_Wave2_newways_112007\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
