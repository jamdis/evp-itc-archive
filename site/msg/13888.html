8 is also a symbol for Mercury, which also symbolizes communication.

hment(s) from Frank Sumption included below] 



   This is from the old RS=
 digital that I did last night. Mostly they seemed to be talk about Chris M=
oon, and the box with the lever switches, which is #46. For those that may =
have heard otherwise, experimenting with tones was my idea, there was no "s=
pecifications" for the box from any other source, same as with all other bo=
xes.  I know many have a problem with Moon, and I can understand that, but =
there seems to be a level, or group of spirits that do work with him. I do =
not agree with the Edison thing, but... what do  ya do? 

   I had been pla=
ying with tones since box #5, and just this year tried to incorporate that =
into the design again as some of the voices were asking for eight signals. =
46 and 47 have the eight tones, although I'm not sure what frequency they a=
re supposed to be, but eight suggests musical scales. So far it seems to do=
 little to enhance the voices. 46 and 47 are more like breadboarded systems=
, they are not in cabinets, just mounted on a plywood base with a make shif=
t front panel. I put four tone generators in 51, just cuz I had some extra =
board space. 

   Of course "they" want 46, it's the best box of this year,=
 and I've been relucatant to give it up. Even in spirit communcations, you =
can tell which are the human spirits. Just cuz they are dead doesn't mean t=
hey have any higher modivations. I remain reluctant to give this stuff so s=
omeone else can claim it's an Edison invnetion, or to claim demons and shad=
ow people come through box, or it opens portals, and on and on. I'm pretty =
discouraged with all things paranormal. I'm not jumping up and rushing out =
just cuz some voice said something, been there done that, and it's always d=
isappointing.
