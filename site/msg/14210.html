True - except there are other codes for fatalities, accidents, and trauma.

Code 7 means things like home, on personal time, in court, etc.

                Tonight at work I was talking to=

sked them if it was a 7 at the site. They 
                told him negativ=
e, and he told me the little boy who was the 
                worst off was=
 still alive. I asked him why did you ask them if 
                it was a=
 7. He said code 7, I was asking them if they were dead. 
                S=

               =
 someones dead.

                Just thought I would pa=

have heard this before when used to 
                describe who is speaki=
ng rather than a name they say 
seven.
