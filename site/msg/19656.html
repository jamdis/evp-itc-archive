No, I don't think I am being too critical, but I may have e=
xpectations that are a little too high. =C2=A0I want to take my time with t=
his. =C2=A0For my own understanding, I need to have a large sample size so =
I know not only what to expect to see, but what to look for. =C2=A0I have s=
een ITC snapshots from programs like this that offer full faces. =C2=A0I wo=
uld be more inclined to believe in such an image as opposed to, lets say. t=
wo dark lines that may or may not be eyebrows. 


Even in your example of t=
he towel, you get half a face. =C2=A0If you have half a face (on the vertic=
al plane, not the horizontal) you can extrapolate out what the entire face =
would look like. =C2=A0This is something I would like to get myself and I w=
ould consider that evidence if it showed up in one of these programs. =C2=
=A0But, if you have something that looks like a forehead and that is all th=
ere is, then it could also look like a rock or some other such object.


I =
am certainly hoping for results worked into box sessions. =C2=A0Directing a=
 session with intent, like saying "I am going to examine the sound waves of=
 this communication in hopes of seeing your face. =C2=A0Is it possible you =
can show your face to me now through sound? " is what I am after. =C2=A0If =
a positive hit like this happens, then I will be jumping for joy. =C2=A0Ano=
ther good example would be a name, lets say Tom, that occurs. =C2=A0If you =
get a positive affirmation that the name you heard is present, then you try=
 the same technique only you address Tom by name and get a face, that would=
 be even better.


But, as it stands now, the faces as they appear are rand=
om at best. =C2=A0I would be more inclined to believe that when these faces=
 do occur , they are going to occur with a lesser frequency than multiple i=
mages in a few seconds of audio like Ursula's example. =C2=A0If this where =
the case, there would be dozens, and possibly hundreds, of faces during a t=
en minute session and I just don't think that is possible. =C2=A0This is wh=
y I need to look at several samples to find out if this is the case or not.=
 =C2=A0If these partialized faces occur in multiples all the time, I would =
be more apt to discount it. =C2=A0But, if they are a rarity affixed to only=
 a few clips out of dozens, I would be more inclined to believe in them. =
=C2=A0Sample size is everything. =C2=A0It is like listening to GBC. =C2=A0I=
f you have never done a session before, you would be inclined to believe ev=
ery stray radio signal is a communication. =C2=A0Only by continued practice=
 (expanding your sample size) can you start to
 rule out stray radio with a=
ny degree of accuracy. =C2=A0


On the other hand, I am very new to this an=
d I could certainly be wrong. =C2=A0I will continue to plug sound into the =
programs and hope for the best. =C2=A0


I really want this to work. =C2=A0=
As you have probably experienced, when they want you to hear something or k=
now something, they make it very obvious while communicating. =C2=A0I am ho=
ping they apply this same rigor to this new format to show us that they are=
 there. =C2=A0If they can, then the world of video and audio ITC will merge=
 in one source and then the skeptics be damned!

<DIV>No, I don't think I am being too cr=
itical, but I may have expectations that are a little too high.  I wan=
t to take my time with this.  For my own understanding, I need to have=
 a large sample size so I know not only what to expect to see, but what to =
look for.  I have seen ITC snapshots from programs like this that offe=
r full faces.  I would be more inclined to believe in such an image as=
 opposed to, lets say. two dark lines that may or may not be eyebrows. 
<DI=
V><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Even in your example of the towel, you get half a face. &=
nbsp;If you have half a face (on the vertical plane, not the horizontal) yo=
u can extrapolate out what the entire face would look like.  This is s=
omething I would like to get myself and I would consider that evidence if i=
t showed up in one of these programs.  But, if you have something that=
 looks like a forehead and that is all there is, then it could also look li=
ke a rock or some other such object.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>I am certai=
nly hoping for results worked into box sessions.  Directing a session =
with intent, like saying "I am going to examine the sound waves of this com=
munication in hopes of seeing your face.  Is it possible you can show =
your face to me now through sound? " is what I am after.  If a positiv=
e hit like this happens, then I will be jumping for joy.  Another good=
 example would be a name, lets say Tom, that occurs.  If you get a pos=
itive affirmation that the name you heard is present, then you try the same=
 technique only you address Tom by name and get a face, that would be even =
better.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>But, as it stands now, the faces as they=
 appear are random at best.  I would be more inclined to believe that =
when these faces do occur , they are going to occur with a lesser frequency=
 than multiple images in a few seconds of audio like Ursula's example. &nbs=
p;If this where the case, there would be dozens, and possibly hundreds, of =
faces during a ten minute session and I just don't think that is possible. =
 This is why I need to look at several samples to find out if this is =
the case or not.  If these partialized faces occur in multiples all th=
e time, I would be more apt to discount it.  But, if they are a rarity=
 affixed to only a few clips out of dozens, I would be more inclined to bel=
ieve in them.  Sample size is everything.  It is like listening t=
o GBC.  If you have never done a session before, you would be inclined=
 to believe every stray radio signal is a communication.  Only by cont=
inued practice
 (expanding your sample size) can you start to rule out stra=
y radio with any degree of accuracy.  </DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>On t=
he other hand, I am very new to this and I could certainly be wrong.  =
I will continue to plug sound into the programs and hope for the best. &nbs=
p;</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>I really want this to work.  As you have=
 probably experienced, when they want you to hear something or know somethi=
ng, they make it very obvious while communicating.  I am hoping they a=
pply this same rigor to this new format to show us that they are there. &nb=
sp;If they can, then the world of video and audio ITC will merge in one sou=
rce and then the skeptics be damned!</DIV>

<DIV> I think it's unrealistic to expect every file to have fa=
ces and images. These faces are often just portions, eyes and lips, some ha=
ve eye brows. Like all of this, not done for proof, it's for emotional impa=
ct.  I have this woman that shows up in towels, always just half the f=
ace. Perahps you are being too critical? As with all spirit messages, it's =
what it means to the experiencer that matters. Expecting full faces is like=
 expecting the kings english and proper grammer in all EVPs. </DIV>

<DIV>I saw a couple which could=

t knocked me over the head yet.  I am going to have to see a larger sa=

<DIV>So, I will certainly keep testing with my copy and hopefully=

<DIV>I've seen live webcast of ITC se=
