So Joel, I am standing here next to my trusty RS 125 and I have about 100 feet of cable running out the window, up to my roof, and wrapped around my water tank a bunch of times...now how do I stick this thing into the radio.  I assume I need to take out the screw to the antenna and then...what...shove in the copper cable....or...run into town to look for a place that sells a ______?  Someone had posted a part name but I cannot find the post...I think it was for the fitting to go into the antenna hole.  Or, my way would be to wrap the copper wire around the actual existing radio antenna and then duct tape it all together.
   
  I did check out the www.hard-core site you sent.  I am going to call my rigging a Loop-de-Loop Water-Ion EVP Radiation System (or LLWERS to make it easier to remember). 
  Watya think?  Ron L

Ron you writing this all down? You just have to keep experimenting 
with the antenna, and you'll be picking up broadcasts out of the US, 
I suspect! LOL
