 This is just to show the board layout. There is no set layout, or design,=
 it's just where ever the stuff fits. I tend to put the sweep in the upper =
left corner of the board as I'm workign on it, although in the pix it looks=
 like in the lower right corner. The tuner is oriented on as different side=
 than on #31. I start by locating the tuner, whether it's home made, or one=
 of these modules, then I place the power terminal. Then place the chip soc=
kets. Then I start with wiring the power to each chip, and proceed from the=
re. I use orange for minus 12 volts, red for plus 12, and plus 8 volts, and=
 green for all grounds. It's just to help in troubelshooting if needed. I u=
se a ground bus around the under side of the board edge.  I use #24 scrap t=
elephone wire just because it free.  I install phone and network lines.
