<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think many of use have a story like your encounter from the past, people do change and sometimes it&#x27;s better to forgive. Take a few minutes and read the link I posted, then judge if there is perhaps a new attitude.

Dave,
 
I left the aa-evp about two years ago.
After being a participating member and even working with a few
other select members on cold case EVP the butlers did not feel that anything but an a+
quality evp was acceptable. Tom had explained to me that my EVP files where edited so therefore
in his opinion useless and my services would be no longer needed.
 
When I say edited I mean the volume was amplified because we were doing silent EVP in a silent room.
He suggested we ask a series of questions before the evp session and then turn the recorder on and let it run.
 
I received numerous messages pertaining to the cases we worked on including names, places, dates and where the remains
of the victim could be found. The evp files where discarded and never brought to light because tom and Lisa did not feel they where worthy
because they had some of the static hiss removed and had been amplified.
 
I tried repeatedly to explain that unless the disembodied spirit where grounded in the location and close proximity to the recorder how was it
possible to catch class A+ evp&#x27;s.
 
Well to make a long story no longer,
We had a parting of the way&#x27;s and I left the organization. I firmly believe that the Butlers would never be open to the idea of box research.

Well, I&#x27;m glad to hear it, but as of last week, the leaders wereunreceptive to the idea that this phenomenon was real.Ann--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; There is a radio sweep forum on AA-EVP for members. They have alsocreated an Etheric studies wiki that mentions Frank&#x27;s Box and the MiniBox. I&#x27;ll see if I can find the link for this, it is accessable by thepublic.&gt; &gt; Dave&gt; &gt; --- lisby@... wrote:&gt; &gt; From: Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Just A Little Spoiled&gt; Date: Tue, 29 Jan 2008 04:45:55 -0500&gt; &gt; Very interested. And I agree with you about the overnight change. &gt; Orgs like AA-EVP that aren&#x27;t dealing with the boxes are missing the &gt; boat.&gt; &gt; Ann&gt; &gt; On Jan 28, 2008, at 8:48 PM, Jules wrote:&gt; &gt; &gt; Well guys, I have to tell you that since I started box sessions in&gt; &gt; November I have become so spoiled that conventional EVP just don&#x27;t do&gt; &gt; it for me.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My organization was asked to come and do an investigation at a very&gt; &gt; historial place (here in Illinois). The owner of this home asked if I&gt; &gt; would bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed with the&gt; &gt; immediately 2 way communication). So upon respectfully asking my tec&gt; &gt; if it was alright to do a session outside the my home we did several&gt; &gt; box sessions along with conventional EVP. We wanted to see if we could&gt; &gt; discover some unanswered history about the residence, and the &gt; &gt; otherside&gt; &gt; was more than willing to comply.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were and are the&gt; &gt; most boring data to review. Something I use to love so much has&gt; &gt; actually turned into a project given I am waiting for a response&gt; &gt; immediately! Too funny how things can change overnight!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I will be uploading some files for these sessions if you are &gt; &gt; interested.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Juli&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
