<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi everyone, I don&#x27;t post much here but like to read along. 

I am organizing a paranormal conference in Oshkosh WI and would like very much for someone to make a presentation on ITC or the Ghost Box. If anyone is in or near Wisconsin, would you be interested in doing this? The conference is on Nov. 12-14.  Go to http://www.wiscparacon.com for more info. Also you can email me at f v s h k a t i e @ g m a i l . c o m to talk more about it.</pre>
