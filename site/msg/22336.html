&gt; Just to let you know, Frank kind of looks at &quot;ghost hunters&quot; with
&gt; disdain. I don&#x27;t know how much he&#x27;d be willing to help you.

&gt; &gt; California,  CCTOPSGHOSTHUNTERS.com   I have completely supported and ran
&gt; &gt; this group with my own money helping to develope new techniques and helping
&gt; &gt; many families. We are having a problem right now and we need some help from
&gt; &gt; Mr. Sumption.   We need help and need one of his boxes to help us with some
&gt; &gt; evps and messages.   I will be willing to buy any older radio off ebay for
&gt; &gt; parts for him if he told me what to buy and have them shipped to him.  i
&gt; &gt; will pay for everything he needed to make us a box. Its very very important
&gt; &gt; to us and i will even donate some money to an animal charity (love animals
&gt; &gt; and my dogs) in his name or any charity his chooses if he would see it into
&gt; &gt; his heart to please help us.  Please forward this to him. Thank you so so
&gt; &gt; much.
