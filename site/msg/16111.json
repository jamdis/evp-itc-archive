Even so, the level of radiation =\r\nfound in the accessible areas of Chernobyl is mostly no higher then half of=\r\n what you get with a dental x-ray. The levels here are not high enough to e=\r\nffect any electronic equipment we normally use. The only equipment that may=\r\n be effected would be equipment that is poorly shielded.\n\n  Here is a link =\r\nto Timm Suess&#39;s Chernobyl journal. He is photographer that has been to and =\r\ntoured Chernobyl: http://timmsuess.com/chernobyl-journal/\n\n  I asked Timm a=\r\nbout the effect the radioactivity found at Chernobyl had on electronic equi=\r\npment. Her is his reply to me:\n\n    &quot;Hi April\n\n    Thanks for your feedback=\r\n! Glad you like my photographs!\n\n    Interesting question about the interfe=\r\nrence of radiation with my equipment. No, I didn&#39;t have any problems; the r=\r\nadiation levels are far too low to have any effect on electronics or optica=\r\nl elements. As contaminated the zone is, I received during my stay a radiat=\r\nion dose of only about 5 microsieverts, which is half of what you get at a =\r\ndental X-ray. I guess if I would have entered the sarcophagus, where the ra=\r\ndiation is the highest (much, much higher than anywhere else in the zone), =\r\nthere would have been additional noise on my pictures. But radiation dimini=\r\nshes exponentially the farther away you are from the source, so the effect =\r\nof what&#39;s inside the reactor flats out within a couple of dozen meters or s=\r\no. The overall background radiation is not high enough to have any immediat=\r\ne effect on people or equipment.\n\n    However, shortly after the accident i=\r\nn 1986, the cleanup crews tried to use remote-controlled robots to get rid =\r\nof the contaminated graphite pieces on the roof. Those robots broke down af=\r\nter only a few hours, due to the radiation, which was so high it would kill=\r\n you within only a short time.\n\n    I hope this answers your question,\n    =\r\nBest regards from Switzerland, Timm&quot;\n\n  In addition, here are some other so=\r\nurces of info on the subject:\n\n    Effects of Radiation on Electronic Equip=\r\nment\n    http://radlab.nl/radsafe/archives/9602/msg00492.html\n\n    Radiatio=\r\nn damage to electronic equipment\n    http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/a=\r\nte/q3172.html\n\n  After reading these reports, it seems they don&#39;t really kn=\r\now because it is like saying rocks are brown. Well yeah-some rocks are brow=\r\nn, but there are so many rocks in the universe, one can hardly make any eff=\r\nective statement at all.\n\n  But what I got from it, is that for an electron=\r\nic device to be effected, it has to be poorly shielded.\n\n  Even the most se=\r\nnsitive equipment us ghost hunters use would probably not be effected. Even=\r\n in the highest radiation levels at Chernobyl, it isn&#39;t high enough to get =\r\npast the shielding.\n\n\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n    From: Rj \n    T=\r\no: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n    Sent: Sunday, October 04, 2009 10:12 AM\n   =\r\n Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] A Question on Radiation\n\n\n      \n          It doesn=\r\n&#39;t really matter if it&#39;s a &quot;point event&quot; (by which I assume you mean a shor=\r\nt burst).
