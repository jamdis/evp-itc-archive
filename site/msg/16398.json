I&#39;m a certified medium =\r\nwith a Spiritualist church. This was a two year process which involved prov=\r\ning I can communicate with spirits to a congregation (not bragging - just t=\r\nrying to explain my background and why I know what I do). I&#39;m also one of t=\r\nhe biggest skeptics you&#39;ll ever meet (It was one of two reasons I became a =\r\nmedium. I wanted to see how they were &quot;faking&quot; it. Surprise! They weren&#39;t).=\r\n I&#39;d like to contribute what I&#39;ve learned about spirits. As Jill wrote, &quot;I(=\r\nt) really takes personal experience to believe this stuff exists&quot;.\n\n\nAs to =\r\nher main question of &quot;Why do spirits lie&quot;, I don&#39;t think we can always assu=\r\nme they&#39;re lying. If the information comes through a medium, one of the fir=\r\nst items to address is whether or not the medium received the message corre=\r\nctly and then whether or not he/she interepreted it correctly and phrased i=\r\nt in a way that allowed the recipient to understand the spirit&#39;s meaning. T=\r\nhere are a variety of ways spirits communicate with mediums; some are easie=\r\nr than others to understand and pass on. For the harder methods, it would b=\r\ne possible for a medium to inadvertently misinterept the message based on h=\r\nis/her past experiences. \n\n\nWhen we look at the question from the connectio=\r\nn to EVP&#39;s and ghost boxes, we have to examine a few items. Was the spirit =\r\nable to use the devices correctly to form the words he/she actually intende=\r\nd? This is a two step process. It can be difficult for them to not only pul=\r\nl the available energy into a useable form, but to also form the correct wo=\r\nrds (think it as a foreigner learning English and saying &quot;car&quot; when they me=\r\nan &quot;star&quot;. They sound similar, but have very different meanings). \n\n\nDid we=\r\n understand the words they said? It&#39;s fairly easy to get them wrong, especi=\r\nally in instances where you aren&#39;t the first person to listen to the record=\r\ning and someone else says, &quot;Here listen to this. I think they&#39;re saying (fi=\r\nll in the blank)&quot;. Our brains are going to tell us (fill in the blank) simp=\r\nly because that thought is now prevalent. If we&#39;re the only person listenin=\r\ng to the recordings, the same mistake can be made. The only conclusive way =\r\nis to use equipment that can amplify and break down the recordings to make =\r\nthem clear enough to be agreed upon by a number of people who don&#39;t know wh=\r\nat conclusions the other listeners have drawn. \n\n\nThe idea of a spirit dist=\r\norting the facts must also be considered. Not lying, per se, but rather get=\r\nting the facts within their reality confused. This is where you have the ri=\r\nght to have the facts validated by the spirit. Ask them to prove it to you.=\r\n They can tell you some corresponding items that back up their claims, dire=\r\nct you to old newspaper stories or to a person they used to affiliate with =\r\nor bring the validation into your focus (meaning the same thing comes into =\r\nyour life while you&#39;re driving/working/ at home/talking to someone/reading =\r\nand etc.) at least three times. A spirit who is being truthful will not min=\r\nd trying to make this happen. \n\n\nOnce these have been considered and elimin=\r\nated, then we should be willing to entertain the idea the spirit may be a l=\r\nower energy being (a bully/swindler/ con-man or woman/narcissist and etc) i=\r\nn their past life and this is the only way they know how to achieve what th=\r\ney want. And yes, those spirits do exist. &quot;As in life, so in death&quot;, meanin=\r\ng our personalities don&#39;t change when our bodies die.\n\n\nAl, maybe he wasn&#39;t=\r\n trying to prove anything. Is it possible the spirit voice didn&#39;t mean he W=\r\nAS (typed larger for emphasis) Steve Tate, but rather wanted to talk ABOUT =\r\nSteve Tate or get a message TO Steve Tate? Did he mean to say &quot;Still fate&quot;?=\r\n Could he have meant &quot;paratrooper&quot; ? See where I&#39;m going with this? \n\n\nAnd =\r\nfinally, in regards to the &quot;end of the world stuff&quot;, it has been taught to =\r\nme by mediums and teachers who were all very honest and excellent at what t=\r\nhey do, and it has been relayed to me by spirits I&#39;ve encountered in my med=\r\niumship service that we don&#39;t have a free glimpse of the future once our bo=\r\ndies die and we move into spirit form. I mean no offense and I&#39;m not impyin=\r\ng that wasn&#39;t what was heard. That said (or rather &#39;typed&#39;), I&#39;d be VERY he=\r\nsitant to believe this communication. There are beings that are privvy to t=\r\nhe potential (underscore &quot;potential&quot;) future in our lives, but it isn&#39;t the=\r\nir nature to join us for EVP sessions. \n\n\nI hope I haven&#39;t taken liberty wi=\r\nth this forum by posting such a long reply. I thank you for your time and a=\r\nttention. If you have other questions or would like me to clarify something=\r\n, please ask.

For the harder methods=\r\n, it would be possible for a medium to inadvertently misinterept the messag=\r\ne based on his/her past experiences. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;When we look at the question =\r\nfrom the connection to EVP&#39;s and ghost boxes, we have to examine a few item=\r\ns. Was the spirit able to use the devices correctly to form the words he/sh=\r\ne actually intended? This is a two step process. It can be difficult for th=\r\nem to not only pull the available energy into a useable form, but to also f=\r\norm the correct words (think it as a foreigner learning English and saying =\r\n&quot;car&quot; when they mean &quot;star&quot;. They sound similar, but have very different me=\r\nanings). &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Did we understand the words they said? It&#39;s fairly easy t=\r\no get them wrong, especially in instances where you aren&#39;t the first person=\r\n to listen to the recording and someone else says, &quot;Here listen to this. I =\r\nthink they&#39;re saying (fill in the blank)&quot;. Our brains are going to tell us =\r\n(fill in the blank) simply because that thought is now prevalent. If we&#39;re =\r\nthe only person listening to the recordings, the same mistake can be made. =\r\nThe only conclusive way is to use equipment that can amplify and break down=\r\n the recordings to make them clear enough to be agreed upon by a number of =\r\npeople who don&#39;t know what conclusions the other listeners have drawn. &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;The idea of a spirit distorting the facts must also be considered. Not=\r\n lying, per se, but rather getting the facts within their reality confused.=\r\n This is where you have the right to have the facts validated by the spirit=\r\n. Ask them to prove it to you. They can tell you some corresponding items t=\r\nhat back up their claims, direct you to old newspaper stories or to a perso=\r\nn they used to affiliate with or bring the validation into your focus (mean=\r\ning the same thing comes into your life while you&#39;re driving/working/ at ho=\r\nme/talking to someone/reading and etc.) at least three times. A spirit who =\r\nis being truthful will not mind trying to make this happen. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Once t=\r\nhese have been considered and eliminated, then we should be willing to ente=\r\nrtain the idea the spirit may be a lower energy being (a bully/swindler/ co=\r\nn-man or woman/narcissist and etc) in their past life and this is the only =\r\nway they know how to achieve what they want. And yes, those spirits do exis=\r\nt. &quot;As in life, so in death&quot;, meaning our personalities don&#39;t change when o=\r\nur bodies die.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Al, maybe he wasn&#39;t trying to prove anything. Is it =\r\npossible the spirit voice didn&#39;t mean he WAS (typed larger for emphasis) St=\r\neve Tate, but rather wanted to talk ABOUT Steve Tate or get a message TO St=\r\neve Tate? Did he mean to say &quot;Still fate&quot;? Could he have meant &quot;paratrooper=\r\n&quot; ? See where I&#39;m going with this? &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;And finally, in regards to the =\r\n&quot;end of the world stuff&quot;, it has been taught to me by mediums and teachers =\r\nwho were all very honest and excellent at what they do, and it has been rel=\r\nayed to me by spirits I&#39;ve encountered in my mediumship service that we don=\r\n&#39;t have a free glimpse of the future once our bodies die and we move into s=\r\npirit form. I mean no offense and I&#39;m not impying that wasn&#39;t what was hear=\r\nd. That said (or rather &#39;typed&#39;), I&#39;d be VERY hesitant to believe this comm=\r\nunication. There are beings that are privvy to the potential (underscore &quot;p=\r\notential&quot;) future in our lives, but it isn&#39;t their nature to join us for EV=\r\nP sessions. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;I hope I haven&#39;t taken liberty with this forum by post=\r\ning such a long reply. I thank you for your time and attention. If you have=\r\n other questions or would like me to clarify something, please ask. I&#39;d be =\r\nhonored to share what I know and track down what I don&#39;t. :) &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Miche=\r\nlle&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockqu=\r\note&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tab=\r\nle&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-7796066-1260409221=:59516--"}
