Frank you right as far as personal e-mail for personal disagreement. 
but =
I have noticed you on more than one occasion with a more than healthy dose =
of personal opinion on this board.
And forget that fear analogy this has no=
thing to do with fear, it has to do with common sense practices in this res=
earch.
 
 
 
Lets not start another negative run. PLEASE!
I won't respond t=
o anything else regarding this matter.

There=
 is no reason to think anyone is being a hypocrite here. If this research h=
as taught us anything it teaches us that changing what we believe and chang=
es in our perspective are constant. The things we pretend we know are const=
antly challenged by the things we learn from the contacts we make. The more=
 experience in ITC we have (positive or negative) the more it reinforces th=
e acceptance of no fear.Now with that being said, if Bruce and Steve want t=
o take this conversation to the negative and make it an argument then do it=
 in private email. It is not anyone else's business if you have a "bone to =

Steve, At the risk of starting a big critical stri=

researchtogether and you even went as far as to do a cleansing ritual invol=
ving a medium. And have told me on numerous occasions that you do a protect=
ion ritual before every session.All I can say is that if you where not bein=
g truthful, that is why you experienced the negative incidents that plagued=
 your home and your research.  Please, and I'm asking nicely do not take th=
e road of hypocrisy just to disagree with me.It would not be fare to the ne=
w individuals that may trust your opinion. I do not try or presume to tell =
anyone one what they do or do not have to do, and if Ipresent my opinion th=
at way I apologize to all. I only try to offer my experienced opinion as yo=
u do. Steve, lets not start these insinuating posts back and forth, lets re=

at read this post the protection ritual is just another diverse tool in our=
 researchtool box, there to use if you personally feel it's necessary. Stev=

I agree Frank, i don't do the protection thing. Ye=
