Then I was hoping to catch it on the replay tonight but the radio \nat work will not dial down 15 to where the station is =/\n\nI tried to &quot;will&quot; it to go down 15 on the dial from 565 to 540 but I \njust aint that mentally powerful I guess LOL. \n\nYeah I know I should just get a membership over there, there and alot \nof other places who charge fees for info that is public(ahem)LOL. Not \nhappening this year. Over a grand on the vet bills, personal loans to \nfriends, bills, and now its christmas and I was going to play scrooge \nbut they are already askin about what I did last year wonderin if I \nwas doin it for everyone again this year so... \n\nInstead I told my bosses to give my hours to those who need $$$ for \nholidays because they are cutting back everyones hours for a couple \nweeks. Besides I could use the rest LOL. Doubt they will but I will \ninsist they cut me rather than a fulltime mom with 3 kids who needs \nevery cent she earns and then some.\n\nSo hoping I have a few extra days off this year to listen to you guys \nradio chats. Theres quite a few of them now. Ive downloaded those \nthat would let me so I can listen to them and share them with a \nfriend at work.\n\nIf anyone has that podcast email me. \n\nMisty"}
