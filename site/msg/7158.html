<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all you Paranormal People,

 Just wanted to say thanks for the birthday wishes. I got them from 
both sides of the veil. I wish I had time to do more sessions with 
the boxes. I don&#x27;t know why people can&#x27;t hear my voices I get with 
the boxes. I guess maybe I&#x27;m the they only are meant for me to hear I 
don&#x27;t know. They are clear to me. It&#x27;s a mystery to me. Maybe I&#x27;ll 
get some that you all can hear one of these days. I clean them up 
like I do with tradional EVPs maybe I should do them differently. I 
seem to get alot of voices talking to each other and hearing many 
names being said do you people hear that also ?  I get a ton of 
Tradional EVPs it seems everywhere I go. My group S.P.I.R.I.T. 
Paranormal Investigation Team of central PA will be doing an 
investigation at the Jenny Wade House in Gettysburg,PA. March 7th I 
can&#x27;t wait for that one. I hope to take some boxes there and see what 
I get. Oh well you all take care for now and be good. Frank Sumption 
is the man if he didn&#x27;t invent his box where would we be now ? I 
don&#x27;t think we would be doing this do you? Keep up the fine job your 
doing Frank S. and don&#x27;t worry what others may think or say negative 
wise it&#x27;s the positive things your accomplishing that matters. All of 
you people are doing a fine job in here as a matter of fact. When we 
all get along it&#x27;s magic. So keep the magic flowing and keep on 
sweeping on (lol) just a pun. 

Regards,

Ralph the Ghost Hunter
(There&#x27;s always a nut in the group LOL)</pre>
