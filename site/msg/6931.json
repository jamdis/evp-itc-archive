He&#39;s pretty clever, so I couldn&#39;t imagine that he \ncouldn&#39;t figure out how to.  The sense I was getting from him was that \nsince he was shot through the throat during the Civil War, he was \nconcerned that he would sound scary if I ever heard him.  It actually \nmeans a lot to me that he finally let me hear him in his own voice.  I \nguess he now trusts me not to freak out.

Actually, it was your site that convinced me to break down and \ngive ITC work a try.\n\n\nNellie\n\n\r\n--------------000406030809020602070400\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;\nSteve Hultay wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt;&gt; Nellie,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; That one file &quot;What are you to me?&quot; A man answers clearly i\nbelieve &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; says &quot;Nothing&quot;.
