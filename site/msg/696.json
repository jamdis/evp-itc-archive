Sometimes you need some kind of background \nnosie for the spirits to make a voices out of, like running water, a fan, or \nwhite noise. I have my own method I use, but I don&#39;t have anything I can \noffer at the moment. Often it takes several attempts before you get results.\n\nFRank\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;*Lyn* .~{}0{}~.&quot; &lt;angels4lyn@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] I&#39;m a new member\n&gt;Date: Tue, 06 Feb 2007 18:38:04 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m a new member, I joined this group in hopes of learning about\n&gt;this EVP... hopefully much like what ghost hunters do on their show.\n&gt;I am impressed at their &#39;proof&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt;I live in a house...with a bit of &#39;unseen&#39; activity.\n&gt;we have only heard voices ourselves a few times...\n&gt;\n&gt;I have watched things &#39;move&#39; in my front room many times  .... and\n&gt;know something must be there... and was interested in this EVP...\n&gt;I have a small tape recorder... but have not picked up anything.\n&gt;\n&gt;our activity comes and goes... I cant say its haunted, because it\n&gt;does not seem as tho something is &#39;haunting&#39; this house...\n&gt;instead I think something lives here along with us.\n&gt;something that may have been here ages ago.\n&gt;\n&gt;I just want proof of what we see and hear in this house .\n&gt;  and thought learning more about EVP might help us in this quest.\n&gt;\n&gt;Lyn\n&gt;san antonio texas\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet in the mood for Valentine&#39;s Day.
