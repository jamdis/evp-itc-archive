I've looked for a patch cord for a couple of months

headphone jack on the recorder to the mic jack on your computer. Open Audacity (or 
whatever), hit the record button, then hit the play button on the recorder to play the 
session into the computer. 

When you're done, press the stop button on the recording software, the stop button on 
the recorder itself, and then save your session. From there, you can begin to work with it, 
without worry of losing any data. Just be sure when you close the file DON'T SAVE 
CHANGES on the original, so you always have the raw version to refer back to.

You can do this same thing with any recorder that has an earphone jack. Just go with the 
one you are drawn to. There are a bunch of them on eBay. If you are doing sweep, you 
don't even need a digital recorder, just plug in a mic into your computer and record on it. 
This saves you all the time and hassle of moving the file from the recorder into your 
computer. That's what I do. You really only need a digital recorder for traditional work or 
portability (unless you have a laptop, which is pretty easy to take with you.) :-)
