<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have a legal question that I cannot seem to find an answer to. I recently
went on an investigation to a public place with a  paranormal group. While
my experience is much less than theirs, I found them to be too disorganized.
Three people came from the group. One had no equipment and the second used
his cell phone. I never even saw a pencil. So, I started a small group,
specifically for amateur investigators staying in local public places so we
don&#x27;t get in over our heads. We aren&#x27;t trying to get any resident
investigations and are non competitive. On our site I put photos and evps I
had gotten while on the investigation and put at the bottom that some
evidence was obtained while on investigations with other groups. I didn&#x27;t
use any of their names. As with any of my photos, I blocked out any faces,
and it was all on my equipment. I signed nothing and agreed to nothing.
Yesterday he sent me an email saying he wants it taken down. It&#x27;s
technically and legally his ( technically and legally?). If I wanted to
start my own group all I had to do was ask. He has said that I invited a 16
year old to join the group (Definitely didn&#x27;t). And that he thought I would
join their group.
-I don&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s right on the legal issue. Ethically, I would have
accredited the group if he was more diplomatic and maybe even taken it down.

- wouldn&#x27;t making false accusations make him guilty of liable?
- I don&#x27;t need to ask him to do ****. I&#x27;ve met him twice.

Does anybody know of any place where I can find something written on the law
about those photos and media being mine.
