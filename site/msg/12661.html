<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, my hands were just too big to get underneath to sneak a peek at
the screenprinted labels. I had to cut all the antenna leads (easy
fix) and desolder the two wire bundles with the white and grey wires.
After that I was able to lift the board enough to see under there. It
was a bear, no doubt. Honestly I just couldnt get my fingers far
enough under the board with cutters to ensure I was cutting the right
wire. 

thanks

&gt; Andy, 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ll try that with the next one, it seems much easier.  The way i 
&gt; originally did it only took 10 minutes though, but breaking a solder 
&gt; connection does seem better.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx,

&gt; &gt; Full credit to Steve Hultay for discovering the hackability of this
&gt; &gt; radio, and as he had mentioned in the past, it really wasn&#x27;t the
&gt; &gt; easiest. After tearing it apart, cutting, desoldering, etc...to 
&gt; locate
&gt; &gt; the mute wire/pin/solder pad, I found out that it can be one of the
&gt; &gt; easiest hacks out there. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Rather than disassembling and such, simply cut the trace on each 
&gt; side
&gt; &gt; of the mute pin solder pad. Takes about 30 seconds with a hobby 
&gt; knife.
&gt; &gt; I felt really stupid after 4 hours taking everything apart and
&gt; &gt; desoldering wires, etc...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; instructions with photos can be found on my blog if interested.

&gt; &gt; The sound quality of this thing really rocks, and I love the 
&gt; external
&gt; &gt; antenna options...
