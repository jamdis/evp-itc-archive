On occasion at night I hear someone\ns=\r\nhouting my name &quot; Mike!&quot;  But that is it. I either hear the voice with my\nm=\r\nind or my ear. Have yet to figure that out yet. You note that you can see\ns=\r\npirits, but can you hear them?

I would think if spirits spoke to you, tha=\r\nt\nyou would hear them as you would hear me speaking to you.  I am new at th=\r\nis\nstufff, and have much to learn.
