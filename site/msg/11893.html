<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>In my own experience, it&#x27;s what they told me. But they lie. So I guess  
we&#x27;ll never really know. I think they told Frank something along the  
same lines. They didn&#x27;t strike me as ever having been human. But I can  
only speak of my own experience.
We can only assume. I figure they would have told me they had been  
human if they had as it really didn&#x27;t matter.

There&#x27;s so much more around us spiritually than dead humans - again  
this is what I&#x27;ve seen/heard and again, my own experience. Many other  
researchers experience the same, and with my NDE&#x27;s I was made well  
aware that souls/energies come in many &quot;forms&quot; (lack of a better word)  
- not just those who had inhabited a human form/body.
