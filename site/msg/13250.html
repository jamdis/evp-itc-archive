I never know who will hear what. No matter which method is used. Everyone hears differently, different speaker setups, different software. I just post a variety of whats clear to me using different methods. Sometimes the one thats not one I think of as clear is the one everyone agrees on as being clear. Go figure.

&gt; If you&#x27;d like some feedback, I could definitely make out
&gt; what sounded like water, and perhaps slowed down water. 
&gt; But other than that, it seemed a strain to me to attribute
&gt; any of those noises to anything vocal or intelligent.
&gt; 
&gt; Just my opinion,

&gt;             Heres a few voices from my latest session
&gt; recording water then slowing down -74% in audacity. For me
&gt; they are quite loud and the clarity was great. I recorded
&gt; these on a night of the full moon (which does seem to help).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Attaching a few of the clearer ones to this post and for
&gt; those who dont get the dailies you can listen on my esnips
&gt; site. For the other methods click on my profile there and
&gt; you will see folders listed.
