  I tend to agree with your train of thought on the "purple" issue.  I've also suggested to him that Purple is a vibrational frequency. However, Frank's communicants tell him they are from Purple, a planet in some other realm of life. He can explain further, if he chooses.
  

  I'd like to address this meme about no women having Frank's boxes.
  

  Frank has made 31 boxes in total. Of that 31 only a small majority were given away. Many were cannibalized for parts. Others were victims of premature circuit death. Some have never left Frank's house. Of the official Frank's boxes still alive and working out there, one is owned by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, and one is now owned by Juli. There are maybe six men whom I know have a functioning one. Exactly how and why each person came to own theirs is their own story, but having been around, I can say that there was no concerted effort on Frank's part to slight women. I think that it was mostly a case of the squeakiest wheels getting the grease. Perhaps one can conclude that the men squeaked louder than the women and can view this male characteristic in its broader sociological and psychological context.
  

  Remember that we are talking about boxes built by Frank only. And as you may have read, Frank isn't giving them away for free anymore, since the pool of those asking for one has expanded exponentially over the last year or so. However, no one is dependent on Frank for a box now. There are miniboxes and hacks and there are plenty of women, such as myself, who have gotten them and are using them. Our results are, in every way, as real and impressive as our male counterparts.
  

  What really concerns me about this meme is that A.) It implies either something ugly about Frank or that he is possessed of sad-but-true paranormal insight about how much rubbish women EVP researchers are; B.) Because of it, you are questioning whether women have less success with the research; and C.) That this incorrect idea will continue to spread.
  

  This meme started on this list and women themselves started it. I'm sorry to have to say that, but its true. There is absolutely *no* correlation between the the number of original Frank's boxes in female hands and the quality of our results as researchers. It is a nonissue that has kept being given a fresh breath of life until it now has taken on a life of its own. Right now, I am attempting to stop it not only from living, but also from taking wing.

          Hello all !!
I have been lurking on the board for awhile, feeling not much to 
contribute.
I am interested in this connection and communication (Thanks to 
Debbie !!)
I've observed a few things on the board. Somehow this word "purple" 
keeps popping up and I can't help but to think of the color purple in 
the spectrum. Does the color relate to some sort of sound wave 
also ? or correlates to something in the electronic field that your 
helpers from the other side are trying to propose ?

Also, I have noticed that the Frank boxes do not seem to be 
distributed to many women (is this because women do not have good 
results with the other side ?)
I know Debbie has done a lot of successful work, but, does this mean 
that women have a more difficult time with communication ?

I don't have a box and I don't know how to build one !! I went to 
radio shack and whatever was recommended is replaced with the new 470.

I don't know where to begin except that Frank recommended starting 
with EVPMAKER. I'd like to build something of my own and don't know 
where to start with a receiver/scanner of my own.
I'd be so happy if someone could share some technology with me !!!??
thanks, Holly
