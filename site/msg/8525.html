<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello, Kristin...

I guess when I think about &quot;portal,&quot; it really comes down to 
what &quot;their&quot; definition of the word is versus &quot;my&quot; definition.  

The word &quot;portal&quot; just means &quot;doorway.&quot;  Are these ITC 
devices &quot;doorways&quot; between both worlds for communication?  Well, yes, 
in the sense that they serve as a &quot;bridge&quot; between worlds for 
communication purposes.  However, I truly struggle to think that 
spirits/ghosts can use this device to physically manifest in one&#x27;s 
home.  Heck, if we&#x27;re hearing them, they are already around us, 
IMHO.  This is why when these devices goes to a highly active 
location, we record a bunch of stuff...they are already there. 

Now, I will say that I have been noticing that after doing spirit 
rescue with these devices, it seems more lost souls seem to be 
brought for help.  We recently assisted two ghosts at an apartment, 
and believed the location to be cleared.  A week later, the owner 
records a female EVP asking, &quot;Help me,&quot; and little attention getters 
started happening again (lightbulbs &quot;popping&quot;, TVs turning on by 
themselves, etc)  None of the sensitives/psychics or the spirit box 
detected another spirit in need of help prior. I keep thinking that 
benevolant spirits when they know we can help, will make desperate 
attempts to bring lost earthbound spirits for assistance. ;)

&gt; Hi LC - I just posted a file where I asked them if the radio was 
used as a
&gt; &#x27;portal&#x27; and I got a very definite answer from them.  EVERYTIME - 
BACK AND
&gt; FORTH - TO AND FROM - YES IT DOES.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Now of course this could be false info - which has happened to me 
before..
&gt; but it&#x27;s something to chew on

&gt; Hey, I&#x27;d look at this (if true) as something positive and not 
&gt; something to fear. A white cloud to me sounds like &quot;light&quot; and just 
&gt; may be a good spirit/entity or whoever, in the home. How do we know 
&gt; that this was a negative spirit/ghost trying to bring others 
through 
&gt; an electronic device and into a home for mischief??? ;)
&gt; 
&gt; I personally do not subscribe to the whole portal thing. If so, 
then 
&gt; my house would be filled with ghosts after all my watching of 
&gt; innumerable paranormal TV shows! I think my TV would make a much 
&gt; better portal than my radios... :)

&gt; &gt; for all researchers,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THIS IS NOT FOR THE REASON OF PUSHING A PANIC BUTTON OR A MATTER 
OF 
&gt; &gt; GIVING IN TO FEAR. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is simply an incident that I feel researchers should be aware 
of 
&gt; &gt; as a possibility. Given in my opinion the boxes do open a portal 
&gt; due 
&gt; &gt; to the connection necessary for real time two way communication, 
&gt; and 
&gt; &gt; the wide spread belief that entities can and do manipulate 
physical 
&gt; &gt; objects when in the presence of them.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have just been made aware of a situation that has happened to a 
&gt; &gt; fairly new researcher whom I believe to be honest and forthcoming.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; the incident involved the aftermath of a regular RS box session. 
&gt; The 
&gt; &gt; researcher had finished his session with the practice of asking 
&gt; that 
&gt; &gt; any entities that may have traveled through the box, return and 
&gt; asked 
&gt; &gt; for conformation, then proceeded to end the session and turn the 
&gt; box 
&gt; &gt; off. he was assured that he turned the box off by going back to 
the 
&gt; &gt; recording after the incident and validating verbally that he did 
in 
&gt; &gt; fact turn off the box.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; He left the room for a few moments , when he returned he 
allegedly 
&gt; &gt; witnessed a white cloud move across the room and noticed that his 
&gt; RS 
&gt; &gt; box was turned on and running.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is actually the first instance I have encountered where the 
&gt; &gt; possibility of an entity that may have
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; purposely stayed behind to turn the box back on and let other 
&gt; &gt; entities through. matter of fact
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; that concept has not occurred to me before. but now sounds very 
&gt; &gt; possible.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This may even happen at times we are never aware of and they 
&gt; actually 
&gt; &gt; turn the box on and when 
&gt; &gt; whatever comes through is through they turn it off again and we 
are 
&gt; &gt; none the wiser.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I will definitely address this in my sessions, what I suggest is 
&gt; &gt; until we come to a mutual agreement among researchers
&gt; &gt; on this occurrence, I think it best that when we end a session we 
&gt; &gt; remove at least one battery from the box to prevent it being 
turned
&gt; &gt; back on.
