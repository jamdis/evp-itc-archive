At least some \nothers can test these things.  I&#39;m not out to market them, just \nthought I could get a few other 12-470s out there. :-)\n\nYes, the part number for the cable that I use is Radio Shack 42-2496 \n(Y-Cable Adapter).\n\n- Mike\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristin Morris&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Mike - great idea to put these on EBAY!  If I hadn&#39;t already \nbegun\n&gt; purchasing items to duplicate your set up this would have saved me \ntons of\n&gt; time.  I am waiting on a digi recorder and need to get the y \ncable.  Do you\n&gt; have a part number for that cable? \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks so much for all that you do for us!\n&gt; \n&gt; k\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On \nBehalf Of\n&gt; M.A. Coletta (Mike)\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 09, 2008 6:10 PM\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] 12.470 Ghost Box System on ebay ($55, 3 day \nauction)\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Well, the wife says... &quot;Get some of these ghost things out of here!&quot;\n&gt; So, I have begun putting my 12.470 Ghost Box Systems on ebay.\n&gt; \n&gt; It cost me about $80 to put this system together, but since I would \n&gt; like to get some of these out there for people to test, I put the \n&gt; starting bid at only $55 with no reserve and made it a 3 day \nauction.\n&gt; Here is the link:\n&gt; http://cgi.ebay.\n&gt; &lt;http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=170184379226&gt;\n&gt; com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=170184379226\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt;"}
