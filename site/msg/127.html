I guess with 3 mediums around it really boosted the energy.  I appreciate t=
he compliment. I'm going to put the rest on a web page and post the link be=
cause it'd be hard to explain each one.  I'll send the loudest evp, I've ev=
er received, before I get that done.

We had just gotten to the grave yard =
and I immediately heard voices in the woods to the right of the cemetary.  =
I went right over there and I could feel them all coming out of the woods. =
 I could see mists of blue, gray, and green.  My friend L was walking up to=
 me and talking about how her emf went off immediately when she got out of =
the car. You will hear her voice in the begining at a distance then a male =
voice says "My brother turned it on" and if you listen closely to the end y=
ou will hear "I did".
