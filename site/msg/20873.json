Keep the  \n&gt; electricity, but, we should work on building more Solar panel&#39;s on homes,   wind \n&gt; turbines, and at least be granted big discounts by government to have these  \n&gt; things installed in our homes.  People would lose some jobs, but they could  do \n&gt; similar without all the stress, Pilots could take on crop dusting for a  \n&gt; while, lol  forest and land developers could become growers, planters for  new \n&gt; trees.  Stop tearing out mountains for awhile, let the trees take root,  so \n&gt; what if we must go the long way for awhile or things take more time, there  \n&gt; would be less land slides.  With less driving would be less need for oil,  \n&gt; less pumping, stop with the fishing for awhile too, over 90% of the oceans \n&gt; are  now being over harvested!  If we could stop eating so much of any one  \n&gt; thing, things could improve, thing is, this whole world would need to see \n&gt; things  this way in order to save itself.  We may not be getting as warm as we  \n&gt; think, even worse we are more then likely going into an ice age if we are \n&gt; not  careful, and the world is becoming off balance, or is shifting, and just \n&gt; melting  away without it&#39;s internal support system.  I think your right, \n&gt; Frank.  sf\n&gt; more vids:\n&gt;  \n&gt; _http://www.youtube.com/user/Snowfirel_ \n&gt; (http://www.youtube.com/user/Snowfirel) \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In a message dated 2/23/2011 12:26:11 P.M.

When you look at the weather, the earthquakes,  \n&gt; the actions of humanity--getting dumber and dumber by the day, the active  \n&gt; debunking going on, the lack of news coverage for comets--it begins to look  \n&gt; like something is going on. I don&#39;t buy the Jesus stuff either, but that  \n&gt; doesn&#39;t negate the facts.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far other planets in the solar system, I  think &quot;science&quot; has it all \n&gt; wrong, I think most are habitable in some form. I  got voices saying they came \n&gt; from the sixth planet, presumably in this system,  and once again I have \n&gt; ask, how would anyone else &quot;know better&quot;? I don&#39;t  believe constant and daily \n&gt; Earthquakes are the norm, or they wouldn&#39;t be  mentioned in the bible as a \n&gt; sign of the times. I think this planet is severely  fractured, and very little \n&gt; holding it together. \n&gt; What happens when you  don&#39;t keep moving parts lubricated--as in pulling \n&gt; out all the natural oil of  the planet? I think we are living on a future \n&gt; asteroid belt as it ceases up  and flies apart. Yet again, how would anyone \n&gt; &quot;know better&quot;? With only a slight  amount of research, anyone can punch holes in \n&gt; every &quot;scientific&quot; theory all  day long. Some dweeb in a university has a \n&gt; thought and it becomes gospel. Some  duffus does a &quot;thought experiment&quot; and \n&gt; it&#39;s irrefutable--how the f--- does  that work!? You think it, therefore it \n&gt; is by virture of titles and degree? If  you don&#39;t have titles and degrees, \n&gt; anything you think of is nonsensical.  \n&gt; \n&gt; yeah, rambling of a lunatickingnutcase.\n&gt; \n&gt; F-S\n&gt;"}
