I got alot more \n&gt;quality from the other way. And it continued on for quite a long period in \n&gt;parts. This way is too fragmented for my ears to make out everything, just \n&gt;bits and peices.\n&gt;   You are right it cuts down on alot of the noise but I think they \n&gt;manipulate the noise and static so it plays a role for my recordings using \n&gt;radio methods. Use whatever sounds best for your ears tho if you will be \n&gt;using it.\n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;Sick sense of humor? Visit Yahoo!
