Why are people getting so wrapped up about comments and even EVP stuff,  Remember you need to take EVP's with a grain of salt for they often lie to get our attention and cause havoc.  The only EVP's that might be somewhat truthful is ones that pertain to actual hunts and are more residual than anything. I'm not here to start anything or provoke anyone much less Frank or Misty but we need to get on with things and get back to research and the ability to find out what they are saying/meaning!

Why did you take such offense to a "harmless" comment if you have no idea what it means. Actually David Koenigs been in this group longer than you have =)

You have all been given the chance to change your tune. And provoking people into petty bickering is not one of the ways to do that. Find something better to discuss and better ways to spend your time. As for warnings consider this the last one.

I personally have no idea what this Magic Cafe thing is he is now accusing people of.  Maybe he's a newbie or something and doesn't understand forum decorum, so maybe another warning would be sufficient? I'd hate to see a newbie get banned because he got his emotions up.

Your attempts to promote your "other group" will be viewed as spam and deleted as such. They may go unnoticed by the group but they dont go unnoticed by me. Funny how its always just that one person/group that you promote while every post you make is not about your research or anyone elses but rather a  play on words meant to provoke someone. You should run a quick background check on your friend the owner of that "other group" you may find you know less than you thought you did. You know who you are. And so do I.

Please know there are many people who agree with you and Frank and agree whole heartedly you should delete the faint of heart...LOL. Can you imagine how they would react to a simple BOO from a voice from beyond? LOL...what fools.
