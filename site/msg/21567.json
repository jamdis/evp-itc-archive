I&#39;ll have to remember your story next time I get negative about this stuff. \n\n Maybe I shouldn&#39;t ask, but ya get anything for 2012? I get all the doomsville junk from the boxes, but I&#39;m not convinced. \n\nF-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Jean Brisson &lt;sonny_mtl_can@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I alway had the EVP thing happen to me on a nomal radio. I tried to explain that \n&gt; I had EVPs on the radio since the early 70&#39;s. Back then people would think EVP \n&gt; was evil and many would attack me even though I was under age. I also explained \n&gt; EVP to many people because I had a vision of how too do Ghostbox by flipping the \n&gt; radio dial. I also explained: Songs can be used like Tarot cards! Anything can \n&gt; speak to a person like the wind for example..\n&gt; \n&gt; Besides having visions I also used to sing songs on the radio years before they \n&gt; came out. The news recorded me many times singing songs and warning of things \n&gt; before they happened. That&#39;s how I got to do movie/rock star readings and warned \n&gt; of things like 9/11 to politicians and put things in the media like &quot;The plane! \n&gt; The plane!&quot; on Fantacy Island. http://youtu.be/_xG7Qwv23sg that would warn of \n&gt; the 9/11 terror attacks or actually warning of the conspiricy with-in and that \n&gt; someone was doing something.\n&gt; The 9/11 emergency phone number is also a warning of  9/11 terror attacks and \n&gt; the feeling someone was going to do something.\n&gt; What I am saying is I was there (in the 70&#39;s)with the politicians in Canada \n&gt; warning of 9/11 to Americain politicians saying we would make the emergency \n&gt; phone number the same accross north America and what the number meant. \n&gt; \n&gt; We also spoke of the TV shows that warned of 9/11. Fantacy Island, SCTV and many \n&gt; other tv shows or songs that would have a 9/11 feeling. SCTV is a great example \n&gt; of this where all of Canada was saying &quot;Take-off eh. Like you know eh, you \n&gt; hosers you know.&quot; It even became a hit song. http://youtu.be/1BFPt001PYU Rush \n&gt; sang with the SCTV comediens Bob and Doug and it became a large part of a \n&gt; Canadian&#39;s identity, &quot;Like you know,eh?&quot;(a psychic expression like we all know)\n&gt; I did this type of thing for many TV shows, movies, songs and politicians of \n&gt; many countries. I put my image in some of it and it shows too.\n&gt; The whole time people have been trying to dismiss me, get me to loose me \n&gt; jobs,loose  girlfriend and  friends. And People tried to kill me. My \n&gt; ex-girlfriend said my baby it not mine and everyone believes her, so I lost my \n&gt; kid!\n&gt; Now I am a psychic for adviser network.\n&gt; Sonny Psychic\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com; RTSC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Thu, June 2, 2011 2:54:41 AM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Riddle me this?\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt;  I don&#39;t know how many hundreds of box voices I have posted over the years, and \n&gt; few if any are heard by anyone, yet if I use other methods, like EVPmaker, or as \n&gt; recently, just pushing the buttons on my truck radio while recoding,  others \n&gt; hear what I hear. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; F-S\n&gt;"}
