I&#39;m Kristin and I have been reading for years\nabout ITC (Mueller/Meeks) and love the subject since childhood (as I&#39;m\nsure we all have.)  I guess I fall to the more spiritual side of it so\nfar.  I am not technical in the least which bugs me to death because I\nwant to learn that side now.  That is why I am grateful that I found a\ntechnically-based group who have experience with this.  So thank you\nfor having me. \n\nAfter reading the messages on the board I noticed that many of the\nevps are pretty creepy - as in foul language or threats, etc.  I would\nlike to avoid this because I have absolutely no desire to bring that\naspect of the work into my life.  I know to protect myself and ask for\nthe highest, etc.  Since I&#39;m here (as in earth plane) I hope I can\nreach people who have reached higher levels than myself LOL!\n\nAny recommendations you have would be graciously accepted.  I would\nlike to begin building a recording device, either using radio parts or\neven my computer.  I found the blueprints you all provided, but they\nmight as well be Russian!\n\nI only have a palm corder using analog tapes - which I haven&#39;t had\nmuch luck with.  I would like to begin transferring to my computer to\nI can utilize the utilities available for it.  Unfortunately I \nhaven&#39;t even been able to do that :-(.  Hopefully I will not be too\nmuch of a pain.  I am sincerely interested to begin this new aspect of\nmy journey and having mentors is something I would be grateful for. \n\nTHANK YOU for providing your plans and information to the public.  I\nknow that it will help further the work.  \n\nYour newbie friend,\nKristin"}
