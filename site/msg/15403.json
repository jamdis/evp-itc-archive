The white noise transistor is pretty critical. If it&#39;s out put is too \n&gt; low you won&#39;t be able to get a signal through the first low pass filter, the \n&gt; one with the 82K resistors. I&#39;ve been trying to work the bugs out of the \n&gt; systems, and that&#39;s one thing that has driven me nuts the last few weeks. I \n&gt; had one board that was working and another, exactly the same that would not \n&gt; work. It turned out to be the transistor, as soon as I put in a Radio Shack \n&gt; 2N3904, the thing started to work. So, it seems you need cheap generic \n&gt; transistors that are noisy for the RVG to work properly. I bought a pack of \n&gt; &quot;NPN swithcing transistors&quot; The 3904&#39;s seem to work the best, but the 2222&#39;s \n&gt; will work if you select one that has a high white noise output. The \n&gt; transistors that I normally use were form mouser.com, and the output was \n&gt; only about .005v peak peak to peak. With the 2N3904&#39;s, the output is about \n&gt; .05 volts. You almost have to have a scope to build these circuits. The \n&gt; scope I use is just a cheappy, I paid $10 for it at a garage sale.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; The MSN Entertainment Guide to Golden Globes is here.
