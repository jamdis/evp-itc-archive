Mick,
   
  no problem!
  with denoiser ( make sure you dont get de-clicker) it is simple- 3 steps...
  load file- click clean- click play on the flashy bits and  it will play the original- then the clean version. you can clean moe or less etc as you go....I am new to the program too but its so  easy,  a monkey could do it..
  although ive no idea why monkeys would be editing evps........lol

          Thanks Charm. I have been using Gold Wave. ACtually I am learning it as I go. I have heard the raw evps' that some people have caught. Then I hear them after they cleaned them up. Allot of background noise has been removed. I thought if anyone could tell me how to remove the noise of the fan, I may get something.

I will check your link out and appreciate the help you offered.

Thanks,

Mick

      The other night I had a neighbor over. I've know him for two years. I 
have been experimenting with evp for awhile but never really got into it

footsteps in his apartment but that there is never anyone there. I live 
above him and have some activity myself. When he stopped the other night 
I asked if while he was here could I put a recorder in his place and he 
said yes. I showed him how to turn it on and he went downstairs. I asked 
that he have everything turned off and he said he did. However, he 
forgot to turn his fan off. I now have over an hours worth of recording 
of a fan running. I just started using Gold Wave. Does anyone - without 
getting to technical - know how to remove the fan?

Any help would be appreciated.

Mick
