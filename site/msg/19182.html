<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The Trifield 100XE is a good all-around EMF meter. A lot of people use
them on ghost hunts. I&#x27;ve borrowed one from a friend once in a while.
You should do fine with it.

The Natural EMF meter is supposed to be more sensitive to fields in a
lower frequency range that are emitted by living things (or ghosts).
It is supposed to reduce sensitivity to the frequency used by house
wiring, I believe, so this does not affect it so much.

I think both are sensitive to the human range of fields.

Experiment with it and have fun!

&gt; Wow all this electronics stuff is so confusing for me, we just went out to
&gt; the used books store, and I picked out a basic book on electronics  and
&gt; electricity so I could start learning about this stuff, I feel so in the
&gt; dark in this fascinating field.  We bought a cheapo emf meter for ghost
&gt; hunting but then went on to invest in an expensive one after the cheap meter
&gt; told us our house is emf polluted, so now we have a Trifield Model 100XE is
&gt; that ok for ghost hunting or no?  Is it &quot;natural&quot; or just for electronics?
&gt; I did notice that when standing with it then when I put my arm next to it
&gt; the &quot;electric&quot; reading goes DOWN.  Does that mean it&#x27;s sensitive to the
&gt; human range?

&gt;&gt; This device is misused by almost everybody!  This is because the manual
&gt;&gt; sucks and the TV people use it wrong consistently.  To figure it out, I
&gt;&gt; contacted the manufacturer a couple years back and this is what they told
&gt;&gt; me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Always us the Trifield in Magnetic mode.  If the box is stable and there
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; no lightning, the box should not sound an alarm unless something
&gt;&gt; paranormal
&gt;&gt; is happening (or you move your digital recorder to close to it, magnetized
&gt;&gt; speakers).  If you use electric or combination, you can, and will, pick up
&gt;&gt; the body electric with every motion and may receive many false positives.
&gt;&gt;  The meter should also never be used while walking because this too gives
&gt;&gt; unreliable readings.  There is nothing worse than seeing some TV schmuck
&gt;&gt; holding it in their hands and claiming something paranormal is going on
&gt;&gt; because an alarm is sounding, never mind that the camera is right next to
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; emitting magnetism through the mic / internal speaker.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, the name trifield is a misnomer.  It only has one plane of reading,
&gt;&gt; not three!  The yellow one (AC) has three fields.  The natural trifield
&gt;&gt; only
&gt;&gt; measures the plane that extends from the top and bottom edges lengthwise
&gt;&gt; from the devices.  So if you have the device sitting upright, you will
&gt;&gt; only
&gt;&gt; measure whatever is above the device.  If you have it laying flat, you
&gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt; be able to measure the full plane of length extending beyond the bottom
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; top edges.  Therefore, it is best to use this device slightly elevated and
&gt;&gt; laying flat.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Using it in this fashion has yielded some amazing results thus far.  While
&gt;&gt; it is rare for this meter to fire when used properly, when a &quot;spirit&quot;
&gt;&gt; understands how to trigger the alarm you can get conversations that can
&gt;&gt; last
&gt;&gt; upwards of an hour.  I have experiences this only 6 times in all the years
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; have investigated.  Most of the time, this device yields a single alarm,
&gt;&gt; or
&gt;&gt; maybe two, with no real time interaction with questions.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I have a Trifield Natural EMF meter. It does not respond to 60 Hz
&gt;&gt; &gt; fields.
&gt;&gt; &gt; The problem I have with it is that it is too darned sensitive. It
&gt;&gt; &gt; registers
&gt;&gt; &gt; the magnetic field of the earth in magnetic and combination mode and
&gt;&gt; &gt; whenever I turn or move too quickly, the meter flicks. If I run it in
&gt;&gt; &gt; electric field mode it does not do this but I&#x27;m always afraid of missing
&gt;&gt; &gt; something, so I generally run it in combination mode.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Like Zack said, nobody knows for sure.  The only thing that we do know
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that there is a correlation between spikes in EMF&#x27;s and paranormal
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; events.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  I have used various meters during GB sessions and there is a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; correlation at
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; times, but this has to be discounted solely because a radio uses part
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; EMF spectrum.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It is theorized that EMF measurements are to be taken solely in DC
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; current
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; because it is natural electricity.  So any EMF meter you have that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; measures
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; AC is worthless on an investigation because it picks up man made
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; electricity.  As for the range, well that is also speculative at best.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; most current theories hold that under 30 Hz DC is where you will find
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; most paranormal activity.  This is because the Delta, Theta, Alpha, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Beta
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; brainwaves of a human are all below 30 Hz.  This is where the Body
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Electric
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fires and consciousness is formed.  If we are dealing with a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; continuation of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; consciousness, results are more apt to be found in this range.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  Interestingly enough, the earth vibrates in this same range with 5
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; standing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; waves at or below 33Hz (Shuman Resonance), so it appears that the new
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; agers
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are right when they say we vibrate with the Earth.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But, as always, no one knows for sure.  And no one knows if these
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; frequencies have anything to do with what we receive in GBC.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; This has probably already been discussed a hundred times over by
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; people
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; building ghost boxes, but... what&#x27;s the average emf range of ghosts...
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; would creating sounds in that emf range make it easier for the ghosts
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; communicate? And would it be possible to make those sounds heard
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; somehow?
