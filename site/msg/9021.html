<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey thank you Margaret.  I think you are right.  At least now I know 
what to look for, thanks to you.  How embarassing...oh well, have to 
ask if I&#x27;m gonna learn and get it all together correctly. 
thanks again for your help.

&gt; Hi Laura.  I use Audacity to record box/radio sweep sessions, but I 
find that using it for 
&gt; &#x27;traditional&#x27; EVP purposes hasn&#x27;t worked for me.  When I do 
traditional EVP sessions, I use 
&gt; any of my digital recorders (which is where the EVP seem to be 
formed best, not when 
&gt; using the computer) then play the file from my recorder into my 
computer, so I can better 
&gt; review the content of the session as well as edit, save, share, 
etc.  So yes, you still need a 
&gt; patch cable.  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I think the confusion may have been when you told them at Radio 
Shack that you wanted 
&gt; to connect your mic of the recorder to the mic of your computer??  
What you want to do is 
&gt; connect the EAR/HEADPHONE to the computer.  So, instead of 
listening through the 
&gt; speaker of the recorder, or plugging in headphones and listening 
with your ears, you are 
&gt; going to play the file and let your computer hear it through the 
cable.  Hope that makes 
&gt; sense.
&gt; 
&gt; Just press the record button on Audacity, then press the play 
button on your recorder, and 
&gt; it will start recording in the computer.  Then save your session.  
After that you can edit, 
&gt; isolate areas, export WAV files, etc.  If you want to be able to 
export MP3 format, you have 
&gt; to download/install the LAME add-on for Audacity.
