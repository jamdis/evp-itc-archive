I admire your courage and \n                          =\r\n      motivation to try different methods, see what \n                      =\r\n          works, and try to improve everyone&#39;s \n                           =\r\n     understanding of EVP-ITC.\n\nIf you recall, \n                           =\r\n     on 7/10/2010 I placed an object on top of my \n                        =\r\n        computer monitor, right in front of me, and left \n                 =\r\n               it there until today, 7/14/2010, noon Denver \n              =\r\n                  time. The experiment was for participants to \n           =\r\n                     determine what it was. Vague or partial answers \n     =\r\n                           wouldn&#39;t be counted (for example, just colors, \n=\r\n                                shapes, sizes, what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;=\r\nre \n                                looking for what it is.

All that we can really agree on \n                            =\r\n    from this experiment is that no participant, \n                         =\r\n       with whatever theories or methods or technology \n                   =\r\n             they used, was able to correctly determine the \n              =\r\n                  object. We can&#39;t say those theories or methods \n         =\r\n                       or technologies never work. Just as we can&#39;t say \n  =\r\n                              they do.

The ex=\r\nperiment was for participants to \n                                determine=\r\n what it was. Vague or partial answers \n                                wou=\r\nldn&#39;t be counted (for example, just colors, \n                              =\r\n  shapes, sizes, what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re \n                          =\r\n      looking for what it is.

Then at the end of the test, I \n=\r\n                                would release the password so you could rev=\r\neal \n                                the contents of the file.

All that we can really agree on \n                                fr=\r\nom this experiment is that no participant, \n                               =\r\n with whatever theories or methods or technology \n                         =\r\n       they used, was able to correctly determine the \n                    =\r\n            object. We can&#39;t say those theories or methods \n               =\r\n                 or technologies never work. Just as we can&#39;t say \n        =\r\n                        they do.
