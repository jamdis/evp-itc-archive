These are difficult, but I understand them, hope you can too,  The one is 
very long, when I slowed it and section it, I hear, "Amy she just got  in" 
"and she cried" "a pretty girl" " crossing over she cried" " Jesus want her  
to cross" it was an interesting session.  I didn't put them all in, but one  
fella said, she went to "back of the line" then someone was saying, "send 
her to  the back, she is a jew."  But, this time they got her into the light  
quickly, and she is in the Light of Christ now.  In one I heard a "hear",  
and "she's crossing" then I heard what seemed a group of angels, saying,  
"Dear Jesus, their evil"  enjoy!  sf
