<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Was that the same person who stole box #63 after i tested it and sent it back to you.  I hate to see these things go to waste.  It really gets to me when you send these boxes to people after spending several hours making them, only to sit on someones shelf getting dusty.

There are a lot of people who want these, so how can you tell who is a good candidate to get one?

&gt; One of the skepdorks wanted to put one of my boxes ina faraday cage for
&gt; testing. My response was Well Dah, of course it won&#x27;t work if you block out
&gt; the radio signals. I told him to bite me.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as EVP, I thought someone tried that and you can get &quot;normal&quot; EVP.

&gt; &gt; I just had a thought go thru my head ( Oh shit ).What would happen if you
&gt; &gt; put a voice recorder in a
&gt; &gt; Faraday Cage, and have a session with a ghost box.... The Faraday Cage
&gt; &gt; isn&#x27;t supposed to pick up radio
&gt; &gt; interference right ? Would it pick up the other voices or not ? I know the
&gt; &gt; entities are talking thru the radio
&gt; &gt; but has anyone ever tried it ? Stupid question huh ?????
