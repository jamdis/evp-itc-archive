I have to admit, I&#39;m amazed too!  I about \nfell off my chair, for the second time, when I listened back and realized everything that \nwas said.  Arthur has a great sense of humor.  ;0)  I&#39;ll keep you posted on any progress.  \n\nThanks again.\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Margret,\n&gt; \n&gt; nice dialog, I heard everything the same as you did (after reading the\n&gt; transcripts). I&#39;m still amazed by your results.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; am 31.03.2008 um 09:49 Uhr schriebst Du (u.a.):\n&gt; am 31.03.2008 um 09:49 Uhr schrieben Sie (u.a.):\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not quite sure how to post when there is a long transcript.  This is the 40- second \n&gt; &gt; condensed version of a single 90-second session.  I&#39;m still working on understanding \n&gt; &gt; real-time.  I put all the response answers in the file description, but here&#39;s the dialog \nfor \n&gt; &gt; the entire session, which might be of interest to those who are working with the \nEVPM/SJ \n&gt; &gt; Allophones combination.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Arthur, are you talking with others through EVP Maker?\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Obviously. Are you vulnerable?&quot; (the word &#39;obviously is under the main tone)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Who else are you talking to?\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Talk to all of you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; All of us? You&#39;ll talk to any of us that ask for you?\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hope you like the answer. Forever I care.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I heard you say something forever. Can you talk to more than one person at the same \n&gt; &gt; time?\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I can argue I capable. The answer, yes.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; You are able? Yes, yes?\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; OK. I&#39;m gonna have other people ask for you. Is that OK?\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Tell them they owe you a dollar for you helping them out.&quot; ROFLOL \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; OK, I think we&#39;re gonna be done for the evening. Thanks so much.
