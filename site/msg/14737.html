         I don't believe in trapped/lost souls,=
 I think that's Hollywood. The trouble with doing investigations, I think, =
is you get the evidence you expect to get, so it will tend to support the c=
oncept of stuck souls. When I record it supports my concept of sprits trave=
l, and hauntings are for show. Which is correct?--both at one time or anoth=
er. 

         I did a recording at lunch time, at home, and in it a voice =
says "ghost--right behind you". I was recording open air with the test boar=
