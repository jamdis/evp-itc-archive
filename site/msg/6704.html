Hi Frank, 

When you mention being distrustful of what comes through the bo=
xes, are you saying you're skeptical of the "technicians" being who they sa=
y they are?  Not trying to open another can of worms here, just wanting to =
continue learning from your experience and research.  I get what you're say=
ing about becoming obsessive with the sessions.  I've probably asked you th=
is a half dozen times over the last couple of years, but who or what do YOU=
 think you're/we're  communicating with?

Robin

  Have=
 ya tried EVPmaker? It is based on that random principle, and 
  predates t=
he boxes.

  I've heard this stuff before, about random being the best, and=
 I 
  have to disaggree. I also think it unwise to spend every waking 
  mo=
ment doing sessions. I think it creates that expectation, and 
  perhaps de=
speration to make contact, and I would tend not to trust 
  what comes thro=
ugh. 

  I don't trust some of this stuff because I have yet get any 
  mea=
ningful assistence with the boxes from the so called technicians. 
  All I =
ever got was a telepathic "suggestion" to use the echo boxes. 
  Everything=
 else was a assemblage of stuff I had worked on in hte past 
  to solve the=
 problem of "what else could I use". 

  I hate to see yet another go down =
the road of "this is the onlyest 
  way". 

  Frank-S
