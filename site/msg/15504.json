You guide may be Princess Kira, I would bet she lived one \n time, you could do a search for her, or you might ask my guide Lydia to \nhelp you  identify her for you.  Lydia recently came through for me over the  \nradio(box), and she even responded to Sharon over her box, Sharon was really \n surprised I guess, I could hear Lydia say, after Sharon asked for her, my \nLydia  said &quot;if your good&quot; in other words, Sharon must get naughty \nsometimes, so Lydia  wanted her to be good, then she would come through.  The last \ntime I heard  Lydia&#39;s voice was back in 1974 I am so happy to hear from her \nagain.   Purple is also the color of my main guide&#39;s robes, she lived long, \nlong ago, she  came from what is now Turkey, she was a rich well to do \nbusiness lady in her  day, and made and sold purple garment&#39;s  to the rich, she \nalways wears  purple robes herself, and is known as the purple lady, she was/is \na healer, and  she and her entire household became Christian, she used to \nallow Peter and Paul  and other&#39;s to hold secret meetings at her home when \nthey were in her  area.  She got the purple dye from shell fishes off the \nMediterranean  sea coasts, had vats of purple dye, and produced the purple color \nin  clothing.  She recently came through for me, she comes from the highest \n Heaven, I knew her voice right away, so I know this is real.  Here are a  \ncouple of her recordings of Lydia, she is my &quot;main control,&quot; guide and has \nbeen  with me all my life, and came up with a few of my ancestors as well.   \nBonnie\nIn the first one Sharon is asking at my request for Lydia to come forward,  \nshe says her name loud and clear, then I ask her to give me her identifying \n color, she says, &quot;purple.&quot;  I don&#39;t know what type of box Sharon was \nusing,  but rest assured it was not a radio, must have been a Franks or a Joe&#39;s  \nmodel.  She does come through on my little radio sometimes, but she is very  \nbusy, and had to come a long way into this heavy atmosphere, she is always  \nworking over there, nice lady, and I am blessed to have her as my main \nguide.In  this last one with Sharon, Lydia has someone say for her, &quot;be good and \nwe will&quot;  for her to come through, and speak to Sharon as Sharon asked her \nto come through  for me &lt;g&gt; and she did.  One of these days, I will buy a \nradio from  you when i get some extra cash, I think that if you use silver for \nthe wires you  may get better contact, but i could be wrong, what do i \nknow?

They were asking for you,  this was a few \n&gt; days \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ago, over my radio the RS  20-125 they sound very clear to me, didn&#39;t \n&gt; say \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  what they wanted maybe I can go through the recording, and see what \n&gt;  else \n&gt; &gt; they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; are saying. They like to watch  baseball sometimes on my big screen, \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt;  &gt; &gt; whole group of them here last weekend, for fun I asked them where  \nthey \n&gt; &gt; were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the house, they said &quot;all  around&quot; and &quot;4 are sitting on the \nfloor,&quot; \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; said,  well I must walk right through you people then, they said \n&quot;yes&quot; \n&gt; I  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; asked them if they felt any sensation, they said they do  feel when \nwe \n&gt; &gt; walk \n&gt; &gt; &gt; through them. I always ask  them if they want football or baseball, \n&gt; they \n&gt; &gt; say  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;baseball&quot; I had one spirit fella here routing for Seattle,  it was \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tigers _Mariners game, since I&#39;m not much into  sports, I wasn&#39;t \nreally \n&gt; &gt; sure if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it was a  rerun or not, but they seemed to be happy, when I went into \n&gt; my  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; room to work, I could hear them in the front room chatting  amongst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves. Sometimes it&#39;s neat to have company out  here, and I \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; even have to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; feed them.  Would you know anything about who the fella is in the \n&gt; second \n&gt;  &gt; &gt; one?

They like to watch \n  baseball sometimes on my big scre=\r\nen, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; had &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; whole group of them =\r\nhere last weekend, for fun I asked them where \n  they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; were &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in the house, they said &quot;all \n  around&quot; and &quot;4 are sitting=\r\n on the floor,&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; said, \n  well I must walk rig=\r\nht through you people then, they said &quot;yes&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; asked them if they felt any sensation, they said they do \n  feel when we =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; walk &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; through them. I always ask \n  them if=\r\n they want football or baseball, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; say \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &quot;baseball&quot; I had one spirit fella here routing for Seattle, \n  =\r\nit was the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Tigers _Mariners game, since I&#39;m not much int=\r\no \n  sports, I wasn&#39;t really &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sure if &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it wa=\r\ns a \n  rerun or not, but they seemed to be happy, when I went into &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n my \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; room to work, I could hear them in the front room=\r\n chatting \n  amongst &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves. Sometimes it&#39;s neat to =\r\nhave company out \n  here, and I don&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; even have to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; feed them. \n  Would you know anything about who the fella is in th=\r\ne &lt;BR&gt;&gt; second &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; one?
