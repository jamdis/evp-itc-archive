The letter from Pontius Pilate to Tiberius Caesar
This is a=
  reprinting of a letter from Pontius Pilate to Tiberius Caesar 
describing=
 the  physical appearance of Jesus. Copies are in the Congressional 
Librar=
y in  Washington, D.C. 
TO TIBERIUS CAESAR:
A young man appeared in Galilee=
 preaching with  humble unction, a new law 
in the Name of the God that had=
 sent Him. At first I  was apprehensive that 
His design was to stir up the=
 people against the Romans,  but my fears were 
soon dispelled. Jesus of Na=
zareth spoke rather as a friend of  the Romans 
than of the Jews. One day I=
 observed in the midst of a group of  people a young 
man who was leaning a=
gainst a tree, calmly addressing the  multitude. I was 
told it was Jesus. =
This I could easily have suspected so great  was the 
difference between Hi=
m and those who were listening to Him. His golden  colored 
hair and beard =
gave to his appearance a celestial aspect. He appeared to  
be about 30 yea=
rs of age. Never have I seen a sweeter or more serene  
countenance. What a=
 contrast between Him and His bearers with their black beards  
and tawny c=
omplexions! Unwilling to interrupt Him by my presence, I continued 
my  wal=
k but signified to my secretary to join the group and listen. Later, 
my  s=
ecretary reported that never had he seen in the works of all the 
philosoph=
ers  anything that compared to the teachings of Jesus. He told me that 
Jes=
us was  neither seditious nor rebellious, so we extended to Him our 
protec=
tion. He was  at liberty to act, to speak, to assemble and to address the 
=
people. This  unlimited freedom provoked the Jews =E2=80=94 not the poor bu=
t the rich 
and  powerful.
Later, I wrote to Jesus requesting an interview =
with Him at the  
Praetorium. He came. When the Nazarene made His appearanc=
e I was having my  morning 
walk and as I faced Him my feet seemed fastened=
 with an iron hand to the  
marble pavement and I trembled in every limb as=
 a guilty culprit, though he was  
calm. For some time I stood admiring thi=
s extraordinary Man. There was 
nothing  in Him that was repelling, nor in =
His character, yet I felt awed in His 
 presence. I told Him that there was=
 a magnetic simplicity about Him and 
His  personality that elevated Him fa=
r above the philosophers and teachers of 
His  day.
Now, Noble Sovereign, t=
hese are the facts concerning Jesus of Nazareth  and 
I have taken the time=
 to write you in detail concerning these matters. I 
say  that such a man w=
ho could convert water into wine, change death into 
life,  disease into he=
alth; calm the stormy seas, is not guilty of any criminal 
offense  and as =
others have said, we must agree =E2=80=94 truly this is the Son of 
God.
Yo=
ur  most obedient servant,
Pontius Pilate
