I often get voices through the box\nthat are just something I will see or hear in the future. I&#39;ve been rading\nthe original Bible code, and came across the date &quot;May 7th&quot; in a paragraph.\nIt was just something I would see, and seems to have no other meaning.\n\n BTW, reading the Bible Code the other night, and seeing how the inventor\nand researchers are extremely religious, and all their findings seem to me\nto match their expectations, sooo- thinking it&#39;s all BS and suddenly it was\nlike something hit the breaker panel and BAM! the lights goes out or about a\nquarter second!  Yikes!  If I didn&#39;t think all churches were totaly corrupt\nI&#39;m be on my knees in a pew somewhere.\n\n Also, what I did not know was that there was a comet prediction in the\nbible code for 2006, and I did have voices predicting &quot;it hits the earth&quot; on\nJune 15th--2006. There is more at work on this planet than man, but I&#39;m not\nprepared to buy all the religious junk.\n\n F-S\n\nOn Fri, May 7, 2010 at 2:57 PM, Chris Salois &lt;chrissalois@yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  I didn&#39;t see if this was mentioned before you&#39;re initial post about the\n&gt; 7th Frank.
