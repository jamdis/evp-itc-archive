&gt; Frank,
&gt;  
&gt; Very clear files.
&gt;  
&gt; In my opinion you picked up a conversation between two entities that
&gt; did not realise they where being heard. The last segment &quot;we should 
not be doing this&quot;
&gt; I think reffers to them talking about particular subjects where 
they may be heard by us
&gt; like maybe one of their communication stations.
&gt;  
&gt; something to think about!

&gt;  This is weird, that mono tone voice coming through. This is what I 
get out of the segments I put up last night.  I wanted to see what 
others heard, as while recording all I heard was the usual shortwave 
stations, and noise. A few English stations, some Spanish, and 
something that sounded maybe Korean.   One of my co-workers thinks it 
he CIA messing with me, they just want to see what tunrs up on the 
net.   Awhhh crap, there&#x27;s only one way to go to be scientific, I&#x27;ll 
have to make another and see if it gets the same stuff for someone 
else.   My apologies to those waiting for previous projects and e-
mail replies, I tend to get side tracked with this stuff.   Frank-S
