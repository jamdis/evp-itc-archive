&gt;
&gt;    It sounds like a tricky situation, and I&#x27;m not sure what to suggest. I
&gt; suppose one route is to, as you suggest, just walk away from all this.  I
&gt; guess you have to look at the big picture and decide if it&#x27;s worth the
&gt; frustration, the stress, and the angst, especially what it does to your
&gt; health.  Nothing is worth throwing your health away over.
&gt;
&gt; Even dropping all this, just for a while, might also tell you if any health
&gt; problems you are experiencing might be being aggravated by all the drama.
&gt; And it might have the side effect of letting all the negativity and egos out
&gt; there burn themselves out, so if you do look back into things a while down
&gt; the road, it could be a prettier picture then.
&gt;
&gt; Other than a full retreat, I don&#x27;t think anything else would make a
&gt; difference other than a full attack: creating, for  instance, good objective
&gt; standards for evaluation and test of the technology and results, which the
&gt; shows and &#x27;experts&#x27; seem to find anathema.  Then, if their claims were to be
&gt; confronted by such standards, they&#x27;d find themselves unable to stand up to
&gt; them, and eventually, hopefully, be embarrassed back into obscurity.

&gt;    Yeah, it&#x27;s for that reason that it&#x27;s very tempting to walk away from
&gt; all things paranormal. After dealing with some of these wanna be experts,
&gt; self proclaimed gurus and authors, I&#x27;m affraid to even check my e-mail most
&gt; days. If ya disagree with some of these people it quickly degrades into
&gt; threats of lawsuits.  I&#x27;m at a point if being very reluctant to provides
&gt; boxes to anyone, especially the experts and profesional type
&gt; &quot;researchers&quot;--the one&#x27;s doing all these stupid shows and readings using my
&gt; stuff, or similar systems.
&gt;
&gt;  When these dorks makes claims for fear sake such as demons, or shadow
&gt; people come through the box, or are attracked by the boxes,  I tend to get a
&gt; bit upset, and yet these people can&#x27;t hear a word I&#x27;m saying,
&gt; their huge egos block everything, as if I make this stuff that works but
&gt; can&#x27;t possibley know anything about he so called paranormal.

&gt;&gt;     Frank, I think you are right in that the reason for the negativity
&gt;&gt; and sensationalism in these shows is that it sells better.  Most people
&gt;&gt; watch these shows for the escape and entertainment value, like the rest of
&gt;&gt; tv.   And these shows learn over time what loses audience (same old claims,
&gt;&gt; boring results, etc), and what draws them back (wild claims, overall freak
&gt;&gt; value, and &quot;we must protect the children!&quot;).  This is all completely
&gt;&gt; orthodox for tv entertainment, but does lend itself to any kind of true
&gt;&gt; research, or any kind of actual edification.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So I think we can expect these shows will continue to ramp these sorts of
&gt;&gt; elements up in order to compete, and we can expect them to dwell less on
&gt;&gt; mundane and activity-free situations, and present more claims of evil
&gt;&gt; entities, mysterious injuries, and unexplainable foul odors, accompanied by
&gt;&gt; more frightened investigators, trembling sensitives, and humorously gullible
&gt;&gt; associates and customers, and all wrapped in fancier technology, scarier
&gt;&gt; settings, and state-o-the- art editing.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   Thanks Rick! You seem to have put alot of thought and time into that.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  What really bothers me is the self proclaimed experts out there that take
&gt;&gt; all evidence and experience and try to make it negative, and evil. Maybe
&gt;&gt; many get tired, or even affraid of seeking paranormal experience for that
&gt;&gt; reason.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I don&#x27;t do ghost hunts or invesitgations, but the hauntings I&#x27;ve heard of
&gt;&gt; seem to be nothing more than something trying to get someone&#x27;s attention.
&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s these experts that turn it into something that must be negative.
&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s Hollywood, such as the &quot;Haunting In CT&quot;, these same experts will
&gt;&gt; proclaim is based on fact, when the facts are probably nothing more than
&gt;&gt; your creaking floors, just to make the whole paranoramal field dark and
&gt;&gt; demon filled. In my case, fear does not sell, I won&#x27; watch those movies.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I think there is good EVP evidence, and I&#x27;ve heard many from various
&gt;&gt; researchers.  Trouble is, it&#x27;s like talking on a phone or radio, how do you
&gt;&gt; know who it is other by what they say?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Just wondering, seemed like interest in EVP/ITC was dropping off. Too
&gt;&gt;&gt; bad the interest in EVP doesn&#x27;t pick up while that ghost hunting mentality
&gt;&gt;&gt; drops off. I keep saying, you&#x27;ll get better, more consistent, and more
&gt;&gt;&gt; meaningful messages if you record at home. The ghosts, spirits and entities
&gt;&gt;&gt; can and do travel. You also have to listen to the recordings more than once.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Frank
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; That is an interesting observation. I think the core of the issue is that
&gt;&gt;&gt; there seems to be a `sweet spot&#x27; in paranormal beliefs where there is just
&gt;&gt;&gt; enough science, just enough technical backing, just enough paranormal
&gt;&gt;&gt; claims, and just enough indefinite evidence that keeps people interested in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the ghost hunting mentality
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Evidence which becomes too indefinite turns off most people. As they
&gt;&gt;&gt; become more aware of sensitives who simply make claims (&quot;I feel there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; GHOST here!&quot;), but provide no evidence other than statements, people
&gt;&gt;&gt; eventually get bored. Similarly, people eventually grow tired of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; anthropomorphism of every little occurrence in a house: a creak implies a
&gt;&gt;&gt; footstep, which implies a person, which, if not seen, implies a ghost. But a
&gt;&gt;&gt; creak does not equal a footstep.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; And while this kind of indefinite evidence can lose an audience, so can
&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence that is claimed to be &quot;obviously&quot; evident by technology. Here, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; investigator is no longer making vague claims, but waving science around,
&gt;&gt;&gt; like FLIR cameras, or EMF meters, and then making proclamations of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; results. But again, people eventually see these are just lights and sounds
&gt;&gt;&gt; from electronics, and investigators making more claims. It&#x27;s like the
&gt;&gt;&gt; psychics again, but with visual aids.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the reason EVP studies are not securing more interest, as you
&gt;&gt;&gt; noted, are a little of both effects. First is the anthropomorphism problem:
&gt;&gt;&gt; I notice many EVP experimenters proclaim what their results sound like, or
&gt;&gt;&gt; name the sound file by what they&#x27;ve heard. But like the creaks, &quot;sounds
&gt;&gt;&gt; like&quot; does not equal &quot;is&quot;. This is then compounded by the technology
&gt;&gt;&gt; backing: regardless of how valid the EVP researcher&#x27;s results are, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; technology can seem intimidating, but the researchers often proclaim the
&gt;&gt;&gt; obviousness of their results. People again become turned off by it because
&gt;&gt;&gt; it is not obvious to them, and in the end it is just another piece of
&gt;&gt;&gt; technology presenting sounds, with no obvious connection to the paranormal,
&gt;&gt;&gt; except by the claims and interpretations of the presenters.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe, taking these issues into account, there is a way for EVP
&gt;&gt;&gt; studies to garner more interest. For now, the analysis coming from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; researchers usually seems like a claim, and it is these claims, imho, that
&gt;&gt;&gt; is being classified by the public with the rest of the paranormal claims,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and so, it also becomes less of an interest. A new approach could be one
&gt;&gt;&gt; without the claims and interpretations of the investigators, one where the
&gt;&gt;&gt; sounds are simply played and not labeled. The interpretation of the data
&gt;&gt;&gt; could be left to the listeners. Web sites which present EVPs could be
&gt;&gt;&gt; developed where people could not see others interpretations until they
&gt;&gt;&gt; entered their own. I think this would be such a novel approach, that it
&gt;&gt;&gt; would give the public a better feeling of true involvement in the research,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and feel less like they are simply being exposed to the claims of others.
&gt;&gt;&gt; And I think that feeling of involvement is what is needed to reignited the
&gt;&gt;&gt; public interest here.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
