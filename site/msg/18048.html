I said, Steve didn't ask for 
the $150, I just wanted to  help him out--and=
 I also wanted to ensure that he 
sent me #13. The box  is worth that and m=

     test session #2 with my Steve's box #12 yesterday. It was a phenomenal=
 
          session. I started out with the intention of doing a 5 minute s=
ession 
          and it turned into a 25 minute "Crossing" session for a w=
oman named 
          Mary.<BR>> > > > > > > <BR>> =

          Take notice that as soon as I t=
urn the box on the first thing to come 
          out of the speaker is the=
 communication "Ready" this actually tells us 
          that our friends a=
