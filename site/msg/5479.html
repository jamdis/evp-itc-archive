Steve,
 
At the risk of starting a big critical string of posts
you forget=
 that you and I experienced the negative side of this research
together and=
 you even went as far as to do a cleansing ritual involving a medium.
 
And=
 have told me on numerous occasions that you do a protection ritual before =
every session.
All I can say is that if you where not being truthful, that =
is why you experienced the negative 
incidents that plagued your home and y=
our research. 
 
Please, and I'm asking nicely do not take the road of hypo=
crisy just to disagree with me.
It would not be fare to the new individuals=
 that may trust your opinion.
 
I do not try or presume to tell anyone one =
what they do or do not have to do, and if I
present my opinion that way I a=
pologize to all. I only try to offer my experienced opinion as you do.
 
St=
eve, lets not start these insinuating posts back and forth, lets remain civ=
il and friendly for the 
sake of the research.
 
And to any and all that re=
ad this post the protection ritual is just another diverse tool in our rese=
arch
tool box, there to use if you personally feel it's necessary.
 
Steve =
and I have taken different paths as far as research ideas are concerned and=
 felt it would be
more beneficial to us both and to the research on a whole=
 if we pursued individual avenues of research as apposed 
to a research col=
laboration.
If some of the ripples from this have reached this forum I for =
one apologise and will do my best to keep my posts to a civil
and professio=
nal level.
