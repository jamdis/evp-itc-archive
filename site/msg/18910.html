<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Try a box on the Queen Mary-ya get nodda-unles you&#x27;re by a port hole.
Sounds like the microwave makes a poor faraday cage--unless ---- left the
door open.  Just like most of the wanna be box experts out there Colletta
won&#x27;t even achknowedge any e-mails from me, and he lives here in Co.
Springs.

 I don&#x27;t know how many freaking times I have to explain that the box is a
swept radio for the purpose of providng bits of speech, music, and noise
that the entities use to make voices out of--No radio stations==no voices!
It&#x27;s that simple, but try to get that through these dipstick self prclaimed
experts.  Not one of them has the slightest technical knowledge, yet will
tell even me how the box really works.

 I think he forgot the turn on the micro wave.

&gt; I just had a thought go thru my head ( Oh shit ).What would happen if you
&gt; put a voice recorder in a
&gt; Faraday Cage, and have a session with a ghost box.... The Faraday Cage
&gt; isn&#x27;t supposed to pick up radio
&gt; interference right ? Would it pick up the other voices or not ? I know the
&gt; entities are talking thru the radio
&gt; but has anyone ever tried it ? Stupid question huh ?????
