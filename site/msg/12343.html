<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I had heard of the book Seth Speaks awhile back then completely forgot
about it. Today on the phone a friend mentioned it to me. Maybe this
is that Seth coming through? who knows?

Thanks to everyone on their insites and suggestions in regards to this.

&gt; Could it be Seth, the spirit guide from the popular &quot;Seth Speaks&quot; 
series by 
&gt; Jane Roberts (a best-selling book which I think came out in  the
early 1980s), 
&gt; or could it be people are pk&#x27;ing this name?  These  new instruments are 
&gt; fascinating and I have been experimenting with both the Puck  and
the Ovilus.  BTW 
&gt; I&#x27;ve never gotten the name &quot;Seth&quot;, but have received  the name &quot;George&quot; 
&gt; repeatedly on the battlefields in Gettysburg.
&gt;
