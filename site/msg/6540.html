<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Robin, you can do it. It took me ages and about $900, but I finally  
got it all together and its running well. I am a technical as an  
onion. I can&#x27;t operate the DVD remote without tears. But I hung in  
there--and you must, too. This is a massively rewarding experience  
and I can&#x27;t wait to see what you get and who you get it from. :)

&gt; Thanks LC.  I&#x27;m going to listen to your recordings tonight when I  
&gt; get home.  I&#x27;m intrigued by the box research and anxious to get  
&gt; started, but frustrated that I&#x27;m not mechanically inclined.  I  
&gt; think you may be onto something with regard to people having  
&gt; individual roles to play, and you must feel so inspired by the  
&gt; messages you&#x27;ve received.

&gt; Robin,
&gt;
&gt; I uploaded some of my recordings that indicate a bigger picture.
&gt;
&gt; Some of the messages say there are &quot;many spirits here,&quot; spirit rescue
&gt; is &quot;very important,&quot; etc. You can go through them under LC&#x27;s folder.
&gt;
&gt; Last Friday, I recorded with respect to 2008, &quot;psychic event&quot;
&gt; and &quot;universal shift.&quot; That would indicate that there is a bigger
&gt; thing going down, in my opinion. However, I also acknowledge that
&gt; people here may have different callings/messages/uses other than what
&gt; I am hearing. I am going to just follow where the path before me
&gt; leads and try to find my role in it.
&gt;
&gt; Personally, I think this needs to be in many people&#x27;s hands. That&#x27;s
&gt; an interest of mine, too. Not sure yet how it will happen, but the
&gt; radio hacks are a nice start.

&gt; &gt; I haven&#x27;t started box recording yet. My impression of the EVP I&#x27;ve
&gt; captured (which has been almost entirely obtained on the property I
&gt; moved to six years ago) is that someone is attached to this place.
&gt; The first message was &quot;Here come some people,&quot; as I was hiking up the
&gt; hill one day with my goats, then a kill-you threat in the house,
&gt; then &quot;get out of here&quot; in the barn. I assumed it must be one of the
&gt; original owners, and I still feel that it&#x27;s mainly one spirit
&gt; communicating that this is their home, not mine. I&#x27;ve gotten one
&gt; uplifting message from what I believe to be the same entity, and this
&gt; is also the last recording I&#x27;ve gotten. I asked what death is like,
&gt; compared to life: happy, beautiful, fulfilling--and specifically if
&gt; death is less depressing. The response was &quot;It&#x27;s everything.&quot;
&gt; S/he/it basically stopped talking after that, and I stopped trying.
&gt; I know this sounds weird, but I miss whoever or whatever it was. I
&gt; wonder if some of us might be better at dealing with the low-life
&gt; stuck or grounded entities rather than the highly evolved technicians
&gt; coming through the more sophisticated equipment. I wonder where this
&gt; is all going ultimately, other than to prove communication across the
&gt; veil is possible. I&#x27;m not an engineer or technologist on this
&gt; physical plane, and I question what I have to offer this research
&gt; since I&#x27;m so electronically challenged. Meanwhile, the nurse side of
&gt; me wants to heal and &quot;fix&quot; anyone needing help, even if they happen
&gt; to be in the next world! Do the guides and technicians ever
&gt; acknowledge or make reference to the earthbound spirits, and if so,
&gt; in what context? Are we ever able to help unstick the stuck ones?
&gt; Are we supposed to ignore them?

&gt; &gt; EVP:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not that this is always the case, but EVP seems to primarily
&gt; capture
&gt; &gt; lost people - ghosts being recorded, versus the box having the
&gt; &gt; ability to capture primarily what seems to be higher
&gt; communication
&gt; &gt; from spirits, (and less of the lower communication - ghosts
&gt; jumping
&gt; &gt; in).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That to me is a huge difference... ;)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well guys, I have to tell you that since I started box
&gt; sessions
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; November I have become so spoiled that conventional EVP
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it for me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My organization was asked to come and do an investigation
&gt; at a
&gt; &gt; very
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; historial place (here in Illinois). The owner of this home
&gt; &gt; asked if I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed with
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immediately 2 way communication). So upon respectfully
&gt; asking
&gt; &gt; my tec
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if it was alright to do a session outside the my home we
&gt; did
&gt; &gt; several
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box sessions along with conventional EVP. We wanted to see
&gt; if
&gt; &gt; we could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discover some unanswered history about the residence, and
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; otherside
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was more than willing to comply.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were and
&gt; are
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most boring data to review. Something I use to love so much
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually turned into a project given I am waiting for a
&gt; response
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immediately! Too funny how things can change overnight!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will be uploading some files for these sessions if you
&gt; are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested.
