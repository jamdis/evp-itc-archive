It&#39;s the filter they helped to make for h2o. A few others can hear her voice tho I havent shared it with many. As always I just post and either ya hear it or ya dont. I think male tones are more easily heard in general for most people I share with on the h2o sessions. As for the other methods, again it depends on what we can hear, what equipment we are using, what speakers are used to play them etcetera. For my ears?..yes most definitely! Most of them are for our ears in tone and frequency we can process. \n   \n  Better luck next time! Oh and I liked what ya said in important message... it only echoes what I have been saying about working together is much more productive than working against each other. \n   \n  Harmony is hard to find in this community, everyone has thier own opinions and is upset if others dont share it or if they cant hear what they can or if someone disagrees it often leads to &quot;blows&quot;. Theres no need for all that, we can all work together and we can all progress ourselves to higher levels. Sometimes it is alot harder to bite the tongue than run the mouth. And there are no experts in this field, even on the other side they scoff at the term. They are still in a process of learning, growing, becoming....same as all of us on this level of existence. Some have more knowledge than others but that doesnt mean we know it all or can be labled expert. \n   \n  Work together, learn from one another. Work against each other, not much learning going on in that scenario.\n   \n  Great advice!\n  Misty\nbruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n          Misty,\n \nI listened to all the rachel clips , sorry I did not hear any of them.\n \nmaybe they are meant for your ears only.

Thier voices always sounded like a tv playing in the other room but there would be no television on and no man and woman visible.\n   \n  When I moved some of the strangeness followed tho I never heard her voice again until I returned to that old house. Once I left again I didnt hear it again until I happened to start capturing thier speech in evp research. Once I realized I was able to do this and pump up the volume, replay etcetera her voice returned. Only this time I often hear her clearly thanks to technology being what it is.\n   \n  For the longest time I had no clue who she was just that now and then I would hear &quot;that womans&quot; voice pop up in my evp. Also when I started doing this research many spirits spoke of a woman named Rachel. Visiting Rachel&#39;s house, talking about her like she was an angel or a guide or even thier grandmother. One day i decided to ask a simple question. What was the name of the woman who was speaking, and the reply I got quite stunned me. It was &quot;her&quot; voice saying the name Rachel. In some weird way it made some sort of crazy sense. All this time this spirit has been around me and I dont have the foggiest idea who she is just that for some reason she has an interest in hanging around me for over 30 years now. I never saw her as a negative just slightly annoying and maybe a bit spooky as a kid hehehe\n   \n  On one hand it was quite disturbing growing up with that...on the other its quite comforting to me now to have placed some details on that &quot;figment of my imagination&quot; I was forced to live with. Shined a bit of light on the subject for me quite literally. \n   \n  Anyways a short while back it occurred to me that I should start collecting her files together in one collection so I started to do that. When I run across them in my archives I copy them over or when I record a new one I will copy it over. I plan to do the same for Otto...he has quite a number of files tho he rarely speaks the others are always quick to fill in details of what hes doing. \n   \n  Anyway check it out when you get a chance. I think if you can hear the evp at all that in quite a few you may hear the similarity in her voice, her way of speaking, and her tone. I dont expect you to hear all of it but I think most will hear quite a few of them.\n   \n  Enjoy\n  http://www.esnips.com/web/RachelFiles\n   \n  http://www.esnips.com/user/MistyDawn if link above gives problems\n   \n  Misty\n    \n---------------------------------\n  Never miss a thing.
