Those speakers should work for what you want to do.  But you could  also get 
the proper wiring and run directly into the recorder at the same  time.  The 
choice is up to you.

I went over to BigLots and got a set of Audio Zone 2.0 amplified speakers  
for about 6 bucks. They are 2W each with a 3" full range driver, pre-amplified  
and magnetically shielded. Frequency response is 120Hz-20KHz. Are these just  
total crap, or are they comparable to what you're talking about? Man, I just  
wish I could run the mic and the 469 into the recorder with the  y-adapter.

The 469 uses a very low powered amplifier circuit on the headphone  jack.  
Stand computer speakers will not really work for it and you will  get a very low 
audio out of it if anything.  What you need is a small set  of amplified 
speakers.  Radio Shack sells a few seats that fold up for  around $20.00.  I got 
mine when they were on sale for $10.00.  Or  any good amplified speakers will 
do the job for you.  But remember the  clocking on am.  The clicking will be 
amplified too so try and ignore it  if possible.

I hooked up these speakers and now I'm not getting a thing. I  guess
I'm using poor quality speakers. any suggestions on which  speakers
work the best with the 469?
