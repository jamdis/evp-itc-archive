&gt;&gt; You&#x27;re not going to find any, I fear. This seems to be an entity  
&gt;&gt; collective who enjoy teasing EVP researchers. They caused a lot of  
&gt;&gt; annoyance to other researchers in the past, but nothing serious.  
&gt;&gt; Some seemed to be afraid of them, but I never really heard of them  
&gt;&gt; doing anymore than being annoying and prankish and sometimes,  
&gt;&gt; well, actually pretty damned funny on occasion.
