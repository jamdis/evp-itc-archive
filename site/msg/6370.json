I moved it to my folder titled Jeremy&#39;s Files. \n&gt; Somehow I messed it up.  If someone could give me direction so I \nwon&#39;t\n&gt; do this again, it would be greatly appreciated.

In the box below that type or copy and paste the description \nof the file you just loaded, below the description box there is a \nsmall check box, click it if you want the file to be announced to the \ngroup that it has been added, leave it blank if you do not want to \nannounce it.\n\nSometimes the server will screw it up do to no fault of yours. So if \nyou find the link is no good just do a quick post that the file is in \nyour folder.\n\nhope this helps\n\nbruce"}
