I  haven&#39;t had time to comment on \neach individual file, but have listened, and  heard them all.  One good way to \nkeep some lower spirits from infiltrating  your mind, is to simply say, The \nLord&#39;s Prayer, and they will go away  packing.  I hear them so clearly now \non my RS 150, it&#39;s unreal, I do turn  them off more often now, because it \ngets like Grand Central Station in here  sometimes.  Luckily, I am getting more \nof the higher spirit people now,  less of the little nasty&#39;s, since they \nall got to try to get into the light  Realms now, otherwise they will find \nthemselves in total darkness soon &quot;when the  door gets shut for 1000 years.&quot;   \nFrom what David the Spirit tech  says, &quot;we all did get a reprieve though \nfrom world destruction,&quot; &quot;God wants to  give us another chance to see if we, as \na people will repent our ways, become  more spiritual, and come to Him as a \nhuman race.&quot;  Don&#39;t know how God  intends to convert this world to loving \nHim, but sometimes He just can turn bad  tings into good ones.  Thank God \nthat TX is now getting some rain, they  have had a terrible drought for long \ntime.  Things may get bad again for  some with what Muslim are trying to take \naway parts of Israel to form Palestine,  why not use some of the upper \nArabia, it&#39;s vast place of sand, but with  technology being what it is now, they \ncould send water into the desert  places.  Just a thought,\nsf\r\n--part1_989b.90567d9.3ba35427_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUS-ASCII&quot;&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.17102&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY id=\r\n=3Drole_body style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot; =\r\n\nbottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Dr=\r\nole_document \nface=3DArial color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT col=\r\nor=3D#004080&gt;Everyone&#39;s files are sounding great!&nbsp; I \nhaven&#39;t had time=\r\n to comment on each individual file, but have listened, and \nheard them all=\r\n.&nbsp; One good way to keep some lower spirits from infiltrating \nyour min=\r\nd, is to simply say, The Lord&#39;s Prayer, and they will go away \npacking.&nbs=\r\np; I hear them so clearly now on my RS 150, it&#39;s unreal, I do turn \nthem of=\r\nf more often now, because it gets like Grand Central Station in here \nsomet=\r\nimes.&nbsp; Luckily, I am getting more of the higher spirit people now, \nle=\r\nss of the little nasty&#39;s, since they all got to try to get into the light \n=\r\nRealms now, otherwise they will find themselves in total darkness soon &quot;whe=\r\nn the \ndoor gets shut for 1000 years.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; From what David the Spir=\r\nit tech \nsays, &quot;we all did get a reprieve though from world destruction,&quot; &quot;=\r\nGod wants to \ngive us another chance to see if we, as a people will repent =\r\nour ways, become \nmore spiritual, and come to Him as a human race.&quot;&nbsp; D=\r\non&#39;t know how God \nintends to convert this world to loving Him, but sometim=\r\nes He just can turn bad \ntings into good ones.&nbsp; Thank God that TX is n=\r\now getting some rain, they \nhave had a terrible drought for long time.&nbsp=\r\n; Things may get bad again for \nsome with what Muslim are trying to take aw=\r\nay parts of Israel to form Palestine, \nwhy not use some of the upper Arabia=\r\n, it&#39;s vast place of sand, but with \ntechnology being what it is now, they =\r\ncould send water into the desert \nplaces.&nbsp; Just a thought,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STR=\r\nONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#004080&gt;sf&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FON=\r\nT&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\r\n--part1_989b.90567d9.3ba35427_boundary--"}
