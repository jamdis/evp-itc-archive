Is that the case\nhere?\n\nAfter a while, most people start to get discouraged. I have been in places\nwhere others recorded EVP sessions and got some EVP, and my recorder a mere\ninches away didn&#39;t get anything.

Your resistance to giving the police information\n&gt; you said you thought you had on a child abductor, even after several\n&gt; prompts, makes me hope you did call it in, and didn&#39;t just say that to stop\n&gt; me from prompting you.
