I&#39;ve =\r\ngotten one uplifting message from what I believe to be the same entity, and=\r\n this is also the last recording I&#39;ve gotten.  I asked what death is like, =\r\ncompared to life: happy, beautiful, fulfilling--and specifically if death i=\r\ns less depressing.

I wonder if some of us might be b=\r\netter at dealing with the low-life stuck or grounded entities rather than t=\r\nhe highly evolved technicians coming through the more sophisticated equipme=\r\nnt.  I wonder where this is all going ultimately, other than to prove commu=\r\nnication across the veil is possible.  I&#39;m not an engineer or technologist =\r\non this physical plane, and I question what I have to offer this research s=\r\nince I&#39;m so electronically challenged.  Meanwhile, the nurse side of me wan=\r\nts to heal and &quot;fix&quot; anyone needing help, even if they happen to be in the =\r\nnext world!  Do the guides and technicians ever acknowledge or make referen=\r\nce to the earthbound spirits, and if so, in what context?  Are we ever able=\r\n to help unstick the stuck ones?
