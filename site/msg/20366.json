Maybe that is not the right thing to do. I don&#39;t know a single person than can handle the possibility, all this does is spread fear, and give the skeptics more ammo. The new age gurus all spread their &quot;opinion&quot; on the matter as absolute gospel-irrefutable truth, as if they know anything about 2012, or anything paranormal. \n\n We have all seen this stuff before, chicken little running around and--and---and nothin! Recall Y2K! When nothing happens, the last thing in the world I want to see is all the skeptics with their chests puffed out like they just won a major coupe. When nothing happens, think I&#39;m done with all things paranormal.   \n\n F-S\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Adriana Jones&quot; &lt;adrianamjones@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s the one thing that keeps me wondering about this 2012 thing... the fact that it&#39;s a multicultural prophecy.
