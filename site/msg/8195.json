Use the Speakjet data sheet to configure \nthat\n&gt; &gt; chip. I just float the SJ&#39;s reset pin--not connecting it to \nanything,\n&gt; &gt; the idea being that entities can use that to control the chip \nbecause\n&gt; &gt; you can wave your hand over the reset pin and the chip will reset,\n&gt; &gt; announcing &quot;Ready&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
