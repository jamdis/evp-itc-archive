hiya LC
   
  Many times we just attach the file via an email post to the group rather than insert it or upload it to the file area. Yahoo groups have limited file space so if we upload every little thing then theres no room left for more important stuff to be archived. Eventually I would be forced to delete alot of peoples things to make way for others. For now theres still room so yall can still upload there if you wish to archive something.
   
  The reason you dont see it is probably just that you need to set your group settings to "Individual Emails" in order to get the file attachments. Some people prefer to not use that setting because they dont want all of the extra email in thier inbox. But if you want to get absolutely everything people in this group send out.. then its an obvious choice.
   
  If you need any help with that just holler.

Vista (ugghhh!) and am new to it. Help!!
