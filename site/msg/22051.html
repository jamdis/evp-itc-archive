<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I heard you say on your radio show the other night &quot;Hand me a cigarette&quot;

If you have pneumonia, i would definitely stop smoking until it clears up.

Just looking out for you.

&gt; I&#x27;m so very sorry to hear about your pneumonia and breast lump! Hope both go 
&gt; away very quickly, and that the breast lump turns out to be nothing! Athena

&gt; &gt; Â  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For having 900 members, this board is a ghost town. When i first joined this 
&gt; &gt; group in 2007, it was the only group dedicated to this and it was a rockin&#x27; 
&gt; &gt; forum. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We used to get between 1500 to 2000 posts a month, now it gets like 15 to 20 
&gt; &gt; posts a month. Not sure what happened here. If each member here posted twice a 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; month, it would be like 1800 posts.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m sure that somebody has to have something to say.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe I should post here - it is hard to get any feedback for my files on two 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;other forums. Athena

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Very crisp sound, Steve. On the AM, I heard a woman&#x27;s voice saying &quot;We 
&gt; &gt;want 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;to talk to you...&quot; at 0:23.
