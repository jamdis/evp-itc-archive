Hehehehe
   
  Yes I agree avoid conflict if you can. It just disrupts your work and makes things get all wacky. I think perhaps you should be working with those who need no convincing and have already had proof to believe this phenomenon is real. You get more constructive criticism that way.
   
  I'd like to see one of your boxes at one of the paranormal conferences like Macy does with his illuminator photos. Now THAT would be ineteresting and worth forking out the $$ to attend just to watch you in action. Plus I'd have someone to talk to if I went LOL cuz even tho id drag hubby along he'd be in his bubble trying not to absorb to much weirdness LOL.
