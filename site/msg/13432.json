While I have no\n            personal experie=\r\nnce with him, in the past he has looked and acted more\n            genuine =\r\nthan not, the rolling of the eyes put aside for the moment.\n            &gt;  =\r\n\n            &gt; I do take exception to the characterization of the talking b=\r\nox as an\n            Edison device. I have documented the history of Edison=\r\n, ITC and\n            EVP  elsewhere. This is however the smallest concern =\r\nI have with this\n            show.\n            &gt;  \n            &gt; Prior to w=\r\nathcing I had just had a conversation with a respected\n            colleagu=\r\ne on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena he and\n            othe=\r\nrs are constantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to\n            =\r\nthat on Door to the Dead. None of those measurements were made by this\n    =\r\n        team. The use of thermal in this situation is not indicated as well=\r\n.\n            &gt;  \n            &gt; The real concern is that no attempt was mad=\r\ne to help this family in\n            a broader context. The skeptic did and=\r\n said nothing skeptical as far\n            as I could tell. Key questions w=\r\nere not asked (at least on-camera)\n            that would reveal the psycho=\r\n-dynamics of this family. We know fairly\n            well at this time that=\r\n PK phenomena is often centered on a focal\n            person who can exhib=\r\nit specific characteristics. That the team seems\n            unaware of thi=\r\ns is quite disturbing to a person like myself.\n            &gt;  \n            =\r\n&gt; A real research opportunity was lost in this case, as was an\n            =\r\nopportunity to educate the public on the right way to approach such\n       =\r\n     situations. Continually sending the messages that phenomena is based\n =\r\n           on &#39;demons&#39; and &#39;spirits&#39; exclusively does nothing to further th=\r\ne\n            position of serious investigators, which is perhaps most trou=\r\nbling of all.\n            &gt;\n\n       \n\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_013C_01C98FB5.9DFDFA90\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;

I was wrong. Door \n            to the Dead has e=\r\nxceeded&lt;BR&gt;my worst expectations.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n            &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Gener=\r\nally, I respect John Oliver&#39;s work as a medium. \n            While I have n=\r\no&lt;BR&gt;personal experience with him, in the past he has \n            looked a=\r\nnd acted more&lt;BR&gt;genuine than not, the rolling of the eyes \n            put=\r\n aside for the moment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I do take exception \n        =\r\n    to the characterization of the talking box as an&lt;BR&gt;Edison device. I \n =\r\n           have documented the history of Edison, ITC \n            and&lt;BR&gt;E=\r\nVP&nbsp;&nbsp;elsewhere. This is however the smallest \n            concern =\r\nI have with this&lt;BR&gt;show.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Prior to \n            wath=\r\ncing I had just had a conversation with a respected&lt;BR&gt;colleague \n         =\r\n   on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena he and&lt;BR&gt;others \n    =\r\n        are constantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to&lt;BR&gt;that=\r\n \n            on Door to the Dead. None of those measurements were made by =\r\n\n            this&lt;BR&gt;team. The use of thermal in this situation is not indi=\r\ncated \n            as well.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The real concern is that=\r\n no attempt \n            was made to help this family in&lt;BR&gt;a broader conte=\r\nxt. The skeptic \n            did and said nothing skeptical as far&lt;BR&gt;as I =\r\ncould tell. Key \n            questions were not asked (at least on-camera)&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;that would reveal \n            the psycho-dynamics of this family. We kn=\r\now fairly&lt;BR&gt;well at this \n            time that PK phenomena is often cent=\r\nered on a focal&lt;BR&gt;person who \n            can exhibit specific characteris=\r\ntics. That the team seems&lt;BR&gt;unaware \n            of this is quite disturbi=\r\nng to a person like myself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n            &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A real rese=\r\narch opportunity was lost in this case, as \n            was an&lt;BR&gt;opportuni=\r\nty to educate the public on the right way to \n            approach such&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nsituations. Continually sending the messages that \n            phenomena is=\r\n based&lt;BR&gt;on &#39;demons&#39; and &#39;spirits&#39; exclusively does \n            nothing t=\r\no further the&lt;BR&gt;position of serious investigators, which \n            is p=\r\nerhaps most troubling of \n          all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCK=\r\nQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_013C_01C98FB5.9DFDFA90--"}
