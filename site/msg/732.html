Tried to get a close up of the little capacitors, so the image is blurry. 
This is one fo the two proto type boards I&#x27;ve been working on the last 
couple months after converting it to the tantalum capacitors, the little 
yellow blocks. I&#x27;ve put that &quot;mod&quot; on four boards now, and they all work 
consistently. These caps are &quot;scavenged&quot; from old hard drives, and other 
computer boards. I&#x27;ve used up all the values the boards need from my &quot;junk 
box&quot;. As usual, I had exactly enough of the values I needed. On the last 
proto tyope board I converted, I had to use 68 uf dipped tantalum caps, 
which works ok, since all that matters is that the capacitors are large 
enough for the frequecies being amplified, and in this case the frequencies 
are very low, only a couple hz. That&#x27;s why if these capacitors are too 
small, the amplifier stage won&#x27;t pass the low frequecies, almost acting like 
a filter. I think it was capacitor leakage that allowed the circuit to work, 
----sometimes. Curiously, they would tend to work in my presence, but not 
when someone else used the boxes. I use the op amps in &quot;high impedence 
mode&quot;, which is why these capacitors are used, and I think this 
configuration gives the best performance for the white noise amp.
