<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Michelle.  For an external speaker, I use Radio Shack&#x27;s 21-549.  It works great.  The 
click-click-clicking is unique to the new version of the 12-469&#x27;s.  The other models don&#x27;t 
make this sound.  

I like Frank&#x27;s take on the 66 being meaningful as it is part of your screen name / email 
addy.

&gt; Hello All, 
&gt; Long time lurker here, got a question.
&gt; I got the radio shack rs 469, did the hack and was having a tough time
&gt; finding a speaker like the UFO geek uses for his box. I found a
&gt; battery powered unit and now am experiencing the clicking sounds. Can
&gt; anyone tell me where to find the small single speaker that was shown
&gt; in the UFO Geeks hack? I think the batteries are causing the clicking.
&gt; Oh also. I attempted to use the radio in a very active cemetary and
&gt; the radio immediately locked on the am station 66. There was no sounds
&gt; coming from it and each time I set it to search it would go back and
&gt; lock. Did I have a hit from the other side and was too green to see that?
&gt; Thanks for any and all input, would love to get this equipment going
&gt; in the right direction as I keep getting signs of visitations and I
&gt; feel as if I is my grandma trying to communicate with me.
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Michelle
