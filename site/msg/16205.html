<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, I&#x27;ve got the tapes.  It&#x27;d take me several days to figure out how to post the files here, since they&#x27;re plain old cassette tapes, so I&#x27;m not going to post them here anytime soon.  But during multiple sessions, my mother and I both hear Gordy several times in a row.  The odds seem against that happening from plain radio alone.

&gt; 
&gt; That&#x27;s my point....maybe it was nothing. Maybe it didn&#x27;t say &quot;Gordy&quot; at all. I don&#x27;t know-I wasn&#x27;t there..but just saying.

&gt; 
&gt; It isn&#x27;t equally possible. Besides the fact that it hasn&#x27;t even been proven to happen at all, if it does happen, IMO it would be easier for a ghost to do it as they are not encased in a body. They are pure energy, therefore by their very nature they manipulate electromagnetic fields. We are incased in this flesh, so it is much harder for us to manipulate the EMF like a ghost can.

&gt; [I do know that I hear things on the tape that are repeated over and over and over again, in some cases twelve times in a row, which tends to rule out pareidolia.]
&gt; 
&gt; If this is the case, then you may well be right. I&#x27;m not arguing the possibility that you may be right, just saying that from an outsider point of view, it is hard to prove.

&gt;   Do not anyone to have you loose faith, they are very real, and very much alive!  In the Bible, it says, to &quot;test the spirits, to see if they be of God&quot;  so right there Scripture talks about spirits,  I could go into it with hundreds of references, you can see for yourself we are all here because of &quot;the prime mover&quot; God, who is spirit..  Test them if you have doubt, I know they are who they say they are, I would bet my life on it too.sf

&gt;   I don&#x27;t know for sure it was my dad&#x27;s friend. But I find it hard to believe that entities on the other side who are not dead people would go to so much trouble to impersonate my dead friends and relatives -- why bother? If they truly seek attention, why not come up with something more attention-getting than my dad&#x27;s friend? Why not impersonate my brother, who is really the one I&#x27;m trying to reach? And anyways, there are hundreds and hundreds of stories of people believing they have seen or heard or spoken to the ghost of their dead family members (my mother being one of them). They can&#x27;t all be wishful thinking.
&gt; 
&gt;   I find it much easier to believe that I&#x27;m somehow unconsciously making this happen (via the process Phenom Investigator describes) using the box. But since it&#x27;s equally possible for me or a discarnate dead person to influence the box (via me and PK) (because, after all, we are no different from the dead people except we still have our bodies), I will probably never know if it&#x27;s me or them making it happen. 
&gt; 
&gt;   I do know that I hear things on the tape that are repeated over and over and over again, in some cases twelve times in a row, which tends to rule out pareidolia. I also have very clear sentences which anyone -- ANYONE -- without prompting could understand and hear (I&#x27;ve tested this with friends and family, letting them listen and asking what they hear). And, like I&#x27;ve said, the names I&#x27;ve gotten have mostly been of obscure dead friends and relatives, not the ones I&#x27;m trying so desperately to contact.
&gt; 
&gt;   So I&#x27;m leaning toward the dead people theory for now.

&gt;   &gt; Maybe you&#x27;re not, but most EVP&#x27;s you hear are just matrixng, which is why mostly no one hears what the person recorded it thinks that they hear.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; But your proof here is subjective. How do you know for sure that it is your dad&#x27;s friend?
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; I&#x27;m not trying to be argumentative-you may be right.

&gt;   &gt; Well, I would disagree with the idea I&#x27;m hearing what I want to hear. The first time I got my dad&#x27;s friend Gordy, I didn&#x27;t even hear his name; I thought he was saying &quot;Forty, forty, forty.&quot; It was only in a later session that he identified himself again using his full proper name. Then I realized that he is now dead (last I saw him he was very much alive), and that he&#x27;d been saying Gordy all along (confirmed by playing back the old tape). I certainly didn&#x27;t expect to hear him come through, and yet he did, so I can&#x27;t see how I could&#x27;ve expected to hear his name.

&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree in that much of EVP is just pareidolia, or the listener hearing what he wants to hear. But I disagree in that PK is responsible for most true EVPs.

&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; If we presume that much of what is heard is in fact the result of personal PK and not a discarnate voice, we may have an answer to the question of why some sourcse communicate and others do not.
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; I would suggest that while the operator may produce the voice phenomena, that operator may indeed be influenced by external agents. This could include discarnate agents. 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; When you carefully consider what is being heard, the themes often seem to reflect what may be subconscious concerns of the operator or the listener. If external sources additionally inform this process of perception, it is quite possible they influence both what is recorded and how is later perceived. This would also nicely explain why some people hear the same things on a recording while others hear quite different things and more importantly while one person hears different things from the same recording at different times.
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; It would also remove the requirement that discarnates manifest the phenomena. If discarnates are indeed non-physical, it is unclear how they would modify the physical world. On the other hand, we have good evidence demonstrating the ability of living individuals to alter their environments in profound ways, apparently with their minds. So it seems to make more sense that this might indeed by the underlying mechanism to EVPs rather than discarnate manipulations.

I guess I&#x27;m just wondering out loud what makes us connect with some entities, no matter how obscure or nonexistent the connection, and not others? What makes some &quot;tune in&quot; to talk to us, or hang around on a plane closest to us...or what? At least in a haunting, you&#x27;d be getting the entity that happened to reside at that location.
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Never mind me, guys. I just have this driving need to understand how all this works, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible.
