      =C2=A0Well, "the box" in nothing m=

sweep across the radios tuning range, or band generates bits of speech musi=

=C2=A0

=C2=A0
=C2=A0Most of the boxes for sale out there are the hack radi=
o boxes. Many of the modern digital radios have a function that mutes, or q=
uiets the radio while tuning between stations. I'm not sure why, but unmutt=
ing the radio allows the audio to be heard while the radio searches for the=
 next station--and--the radio is disallowed form locking onto a station,=C2=
=A0so it keeps sweeping all the way to the end of the band--AM or FM, then =
starts over. This creates the raw audio and "they" speak. The sweep can eve=
n be done by hand, tuning a radio slowing by hand. I sue cheap radios I get=
 at thrift stores for this, gluing a dowel to the tuning knob to make it ea=
sier. Then record form the speaker--open air. 

=C2=A0
=C2=A0So as long as =
the radio sweeps at not to fast and not too slow, it'll works. Some are bet=
ter than others. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0It takes some practice, and maybe even a cer=
tain allowing to hear the ghost voices. 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0I prefer to take a tu=
ner out of a radio, such as a clock radio and supply an external sweep volt=
age. The sweep circuits are just basic op amps, and you can buy a function =
generator kit to supply a triangle wave for linear sweep. See keyportparano=
rmal.com for more info on using this kit, and building boxes. 

=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0One problem with this stuff is that it can be extremely subjective, othe=
rs may not hear what you hear, or hear it the same. I think mostly the mess=
ages are meant for the one that receives it. We go round and round with the=
 skeptics and debunkers.

Ok, we're new =
here hello!

We just had a couple questions. HOW do you tell if you're bein=
g ripped off if you are searching online to buy a box? If you can point us =
in the right direction of where to purchase a "frank's box" would be deeply=
 appreciated.

We saw that you can try and make your own but with my husban=
d's work schedule and mine with 4 kids, sports etc.. the only time we get t=
o work with EVP's and such is when we schedule an investigation and secure =
a babysitter! LOL Not to mention my husband isn't that technologically incl=
ined. That is my job... and I would be afraid that I'd have done something =
incorrectly and what we were experiencing really wasn't "true".

Sorry to s=
ound like such a newbie I'm sure!

Thank you! Teddy
