Willy, Really interested in listening to the new files.  I'll let you know after.
  Just to throw in regarding EVP maker and everything else but the boxes.  I used EVP maker and the water method AND foreign language broadcast method and radio static and box fan, etc etc etc before I got my shack hack and my Joe's box, and I must admit that I have put everything else aside even though I got good results with ALL of those other methods.  There's just something very exciting about the boxes, I think, that makes us forsake all others.  When I started using a hack, which Jeff Rezman made for me before I got the Joe's Box, I felt it was a nervous sort of experimentation--that is to say, the loud, short, fast sound clips had me on edge, as I was used to quiet static and water, but I think now I'm addicted to the sound and the frenzy of it!  Does anyone else feel this way?

          Ursula and Misty � thank you very much for your feedback. I 
really appreciate you taking the time to listen, and for the 
comments, especially noting the dual layers of speech. Interesting. 
Frank S. - Thanks for the recent files from EVPmaker - nice! 
There hasn't been much discussion regarding EVPmaker lately, so I 
wasn't' sure if it was a viable tool to use. I haven't read many 
older posts, but hope to get caught up during the holidays. Have you 
or others considered modifying speech synthesis software to generate 
random sounds? I wonder how something like that would work�
On the 16th I did three 3minute recordings and got 9 clips from 
them. In this session, I was asking questions regarding a knocking 
sound I heard while going to sleep or waking up about 12 years ago. 
My life situation wasn't the best at that time. It was always three 
knocks, and once a doorbell, but not the doorbell for where I was 
then living. Started the Knocking session by telling "Rick" that I 
got messages from previous session, got "Well, he's got patience!" 
for response. Then was told, "Aye, it smells in here." Next asked 
them what sound did I hear back then, and got "it was knocking (maybe 
nothing?)" The best one so far is; "Our earthbound forefathers are 
video programs." A second voice keeps repeating "Ent" syllable 
during this one. I have put these files in a new folder called 
Knocking, which is under Laptop MP3s. More comments there. 
I'm making progress on getting the software needed to do 
linear scanning with the Radio Shark 2 USB am/fm radio and hope to 
have it up and running within the next week or two. 
Thanks again to all
Willy
