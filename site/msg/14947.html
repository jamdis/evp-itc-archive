 IMDb, June 4, 2009

                        David Carradine died during a =
sex game that went wrong, according to sources in Bangkok, Thailand, where =
he was found dead on Thursday.

                        Carradine's body wa=
s discovered in a hotel suite and local reports suggested he committed suic=
ide. 

                        He was discovered by a maid, naked and hange=
d, but the suggestions his death had a sexual twist were strongly disputed =
by the star's close friend, attorney Vicki Roberts, and his manager Chuck B=
inder, who insisted he died of natural causes. 

                        Bu=

during a sex act.

                        The spokesperson tells TMZ.com, =
"We can confirm 100 percent that he never would have committed suicide. It =
was an accidental death. Everybody is in shock."

                        The cop tells reporters, "A rope was attached t=

                        Rocker Michael=
 Hutchence was rumoured to have died attempting the same sex act in a Sydne=

                        Carradine was in Thailand to sho=
