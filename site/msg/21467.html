<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks. I think I heard something about millions of people, but didn&#x27;t understand it. Maybe it&#x27;s Snow&#x27;s rapture?

&gt; Frank,
&gt; 
&gt; In your first clip, I also hear &quot;Not&quot; before bad work.
&gt; I heard 90% of your second clip the way you heard it.
&gt; The last clip I heard as you did.
&gt; 
&gt; But what intrigues me most is the &quot;I wanna fuck him&quot; clip.  I recorded the
&gt; same type of message yesterday with a Sangean hack and I got something about
&gt; &quot;Princess,&quot; which is something I almost never record.
&gt; 
&gt; :09 &quot;Tim&quot;
&gt; :16 &quot;I can&#x27;t find her the Princess&quot;
&gt; :23 &quot;Hey ya know I fucked ya.&quot;
&gt; :26 &quot;Andy&quot;
&gt; :34 &quot;You&#x27;re psycho shut-up&quot;
&gt; :42 &quot;We talk over radio&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; There is also talk at the beginning about 10 million people disappearing and
&gt; at about :20, there is a brief piece of language which is not human, at
&gt; least not any human language I have ever heard before.
