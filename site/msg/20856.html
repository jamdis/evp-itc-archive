More stuff about Jupiter,  "would display metallic properties, losing  hold=
 
over their electrons._[1]_ 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_hydrog=
en#cite_note-0)   Since then, metallic hydrogen has been described as "the =
holy 
grail of  high-pressure physics"._[2]_ 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki=
/Metallic_hydrogen#cite_note-1) "he  cloud layer is only about 50 km deep, =
and 
consists of at least two decks of  clouds: a thick lower deck and a th=
in clearer 
region. There may also be a thin  layer of _water_ 
(http://en.=
wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(properties))  clouds  underlying the ammonia laye=
r, as 
evidenced by flashes of _lightning_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li=
ghtning)  
detected in the  atmosphere of Jupiter. (Water is a _polar molec=
ule_ 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_molecule)  that can  carry a char=
ge, so it is capable 
of creating the charge separation needed to  produce =
lightning.)_[29]_ 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter#cite_note-elkins-t=
anton-28)   These 
electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as p=
owerful as  lightning on 
the Earth._[42]_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ju=
piter#cite_note-41)   The 
water clouds can form thunderstorms driven by th=
e heat rising from the  
interior._[43]_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupi=
ter#cite_note-42) "
Well, if that is all true, there is some work that has =
to be done to make  
Jupiter a place to sustain life, it has water, but the=
 electrons and protons 
are  just floating around, and things would need to=
 be fuzzed together. 
Electrons  within the plasma sheet generate a strong =
_radio_

_MHz_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her=

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter#cite_note-58) "    Too m=
uch to post here, but when you all get a 
chance read up on Jupiter, things=
  are not fuzzed, but the elements are all 
there, it has 63 moons, some of=
 which  may also have water. sf
