Yeah Frank, I get some great results with the closeups sometimes. You will still get the fuzzy pixel ones but occasionally a face jumps out of nowhere and freaks ya out. That is why I try and stick to stuff that doesnt have any people in it now and I record about 1-2 inches away from the screen so theres glare and stuff like that going on. So I am 100% positive that what comes thru was never there. Video tape on vhs then rerecording that is how I got some of my best results. 
   
  I got some great ones just using the feedback loop as well but they are few and far between because the light source is flashing and not constant they have little to work with.
   
  The youth turned one is my "first" crystal clear image, and of someone I know. That was how they showed me that thier suggestion worked better than the feedback loop way I was using before. They suggested using the tv I just didnt know how they meant exactly because I was still getting fuzzy images....I thought maybe they meant use it for the feedback loop with a camcorder. So while I did my session I asked them to show themselves clearly if I was doing it the way they wanted or I was going to stop until I got the camcorder...and then I got that. Then the others started showing up.

              I agree, those are amazing. I need to get busy again, and maybe try your set up. That �youth turned� image is pretty close to one I got that I thought was just a TV image.
