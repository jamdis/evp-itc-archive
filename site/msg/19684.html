Just my two cents and input based=C2=A0on what I get from my ancestral guid=
es and guardians...
=C2=A0
The spiritual dimension and those who reside the=
re=C2=A0do not=C2=A0perceive "time" as we do in=C2=A0the typical=C2=A0linea=
r fashion. Remember the saying, "In the twinkling of an eye?"
=C2=A0
10,000=
 years here may only seem like a few precious moments over=C2=A0there, and =
vice versa. 
=C2=A0
They also remind me of the quantum field, string theory=
, our=C2=A0holographic Universe (etc)=C2=A0and that ALL time is "ticking" (=
past, present=C2=A0& future) at the very same moment. It's all happening=C2=
=A0RIGHT=C2=A0NOW in various levels, layers, alternative realities and spir=
itual/energetic dimensions.
=C2=A0
The end of the Earth has already happene=
d (for them and us!) in many ways. Depending on who you're speaking=C2=A0to=
, some even describe what it was like when=C2=A0the planet Earth was destro=
yed, speaking as though it has/had already occured.=C2=A0There would also b=
e dimensions in which this event has already occured thousands of years ago=
, 5 minutes ago, 3 days from now and 10,000 years into the future and every=
 other possible scenario. 
=C2=A0
So which one is the RIGHT one then? 
=C2=
=A0
Well, I think they all are. 
=C2=A0
Because "they" live in a world of "=
source energy", light, consciousness and perfect=C2=A0information fields...=
one that's=C2=A0so completely and totally different to our own experience h=
ere/now=C2=A0and are=C2=A0not limited by linear time and local/non-local sp=
ace=C2=A0or relativity like we are, it's likely very difficult for most of =
the beings we would speak to through the box to give us specific informatio=
n regarding such an event or the exact time (or even "which Earth" they are=
 referencing, dimensionally speaking!). 
=C2=A0
In other words, they don't =
experience any of this stuff (and especially=C2=A0"time") like we do. =C2=
=A0
=C2=A0
To end,=C2=A0for several years=C2=A0now I've been=C2=A0a devoted=
 care-giver to the ancient quartz=C2=A0crystal skulls=C2=A0of Mayan legend=
=C2=A0and much of the mythologies and folklore surrounding these objects is=
 focused around 2012 and the impending=C2=A0Great Shift. I've also=C2=A0stu=
died South American culture (past and present), anthropology,=C2=A0folklore=
=C2=A0and tribal customs along with=C2=A0their indigenous wisdom systems in=
=C2=A0varying=C2=A0depth with the Kogi Indians, Quechua Curanderos and resi=
dents of the Amazon. 
=C2=A0
For many years I followed the work of Terence =
McKenna=C2=A0rather closely and Terence is someone I consider a man-genius =
far ahead of his time (may he rest in peace). He developed a time-mapping s=
ystem based on the I-Ching, the Mayan Calendar, Great Pyramids, DMT-beings,=
 fractals, plant consciousness=C2=A0and other mathematic systems=C2=A0that =
showed a sharp spike followed by a near-perfect "dip" before it went off th=
e charts and moved into "nothingness" completely around December 21st, 2012=
...and even Terence didn't think this is when the world would end, necessar=
ily. 
=C2=A0
(His "official" position is that he simply didn't know what to=
 make of it or expect. One theory is that his algorithms reflected such a c=
hange during a time=C2=A0that humanity may have finally broken the time/spa=
ce barrier and uncovered the keys to time travel and 4th dimensional plane-=
shifting, to name just one possible solution.). =C2=A0
=C2=A0
I've also bee=
n fortunate enough to live in Swaziland, South Africa with the Swazi, Zulu,=
 Xhosa=C2=A0and San Bushmen tribes who (like most other cultures throughout=
 time and history)=C2=A0also have their own teachings and mystery tradition=
s surrounding
this and other events. 
=C2=A0
Given that the San are the mos=
t ancient tribal peoples and humanities oldest ancestors still living in th=
e world today and whose incredible healing knowledge, spiritual wisdoms and=
 mystical practices far exceed any I've ever heard of or personally witness=
ed anywhere else in the world and they don't seem to feel that life on this=
=C2=A0planet=C2=A0is going to end anytime soon, so I'm not going to panic j=
ust yet. 
=C2=A0
These amazing people have their ears pressed up very close=
ly to the heartbeat and rhythms of Mother Earth and told me firsthand that =
before the end comes certain events will take place on a scale the whole wo=
rld will be instantly made aware of...events that could still take several =
hundred or even thousands of years to unfold.
=C2=A0
All I know for my own =
self, personally, is that I have no clue what's going to happen...but it wi=
ll be okay, no matter what takes place. There are worst things than dying, =
believe me...and part of what makes our work with the Ghost Box and ITC in =
general so helpful and inspiring is that we can find a level of peace and c=
omfort through our sessions and recordings we might actually need one day, =
whether soon or in some distant time - we're all going to end up there even=
tually, no doubt about it! 
=C2=A0
FINAL NOTE: I don't have all the answers=
...I don't even have all the questions, and I know it. My guess is as good =
as any and I could be completely and totally WRONG about all of this (I'm o=
pen to that and=C2=A0I'm perfectly fine with it). Believe you me, if the wo=
rld ends when a lot of=C2=A0folks think it might I'll be just as surprised =
as anyone. Until then I'll keep doing what I do now; realizing that I don't=
 know a damn thing, taking life as it comes to me day by precious=C2=A0day,=
 treating it with respect and honoring=C2=A0my experience here=C2=A0as the =
gift it is, loving others, being good to the people around me=C2=A0and enjo=
ying my family and time spent here while I can. 
=C2=A0
And I won't be afra=
id...not even for one second or when I'm looking up and seeing that big f**=
*ing rock heading right towards us, hahaha. For all I know (or anyone here =
for that matter), I could be blindsided by a Mac truck later this evening! =

=C2=A0
Many of the people worried over 2012 won't even be here when 2012 a=
rrives...now how's THAT for a mind-f**k!?!?

Frank,

Remember last year when we both got the August predictions=
? That didn't pan out, so i wouldn't take what they say too seriously. They=
 have never said anything that came true yet, i don't think they can.

I'm =
pretty sure that they can't tell the future, so when they say stuff i think=
 they are just messing with us to see what we do with the information. They=
 might even be laughing at us !
