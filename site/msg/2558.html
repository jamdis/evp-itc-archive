<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Good morning everyone! I&#x27;m Kristin and I have been reading for years
about ITC (Mueller/Meeks) and love the subject since childhood (as I&#x27;m
sure we all have.)  I guess I fall to the more spiritual side of it so
far.  I am not technical in the least which bugs me to death because I
want to learn that side now.  That is why I am grateful that I found a
technically-based group who have experience with this.  So thank you
for having me. 

After reading the messages on the board I noticed that many of the
evps are pretty creepy - as in foul language or threats, etc.  I would
like to avoid this because I have absolutely no desire to bring that
aspect of the work into my life.  I know to protect myself and ask for
the highest, etc.  Since I&#x27;m here (as in earth plane) I hope I can
reach people who have reached higher levels than myself LOL!

Any recommendations you have would be graciously accepted.  I would
like to begin building a recording device, either using radio parts or
even my computer.  I found the blueprints you all provided, but they
might as well be Russian!

I only have a palm corder using analog tapes - which I haven&#x27;t had
much luck with.  I would like to begin transferring to my computer to
I can utilize the utilities available for it.  Unfortunately I 
haven&#x27;t even been able to do that :-(.  Hopefully I will not be too
much of a pain.  I am sincerely interested to begin this new aspect of
my journey and having mentors is something I would be grateful for. 

THANK YOU for providing your plans and information to the public.  I
know that it will help further the work.  

Your newbie friend,
Kristin</pre>
