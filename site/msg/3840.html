&gt; &gt;  Hi All, What&#x27;s to keep Chris from getting a Patent of his own on  
&gt; &gt; HIS &quot;Telephone to The Dead&quot;? Does Frank have his &quot;Franks Box&quot;  
&gt; &gt; Patented by the U.S. Patent Offices (the cost is low for this,  
&gt; &gt; BTW)???? I think it has merit thus far, for Frank to consider a  
&gt; &gt; Lawsuit! So what if it was a gift, Frank stated it was to be used  
&gt; &gt; in 1 place (statonary) &amp; for testing purposes ONLY. What Chris has  
&gt; &gt; done with it, is Run with it making several businesses with it and  
&gt; &gt; making a profit from it . . . . this is NOT what Frank intended HIS  
&gt; &gt; Box(es) to be used as! =Judy=
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; There is nothing to stop Frank from trying to patent it, if he so  
&gt; chooses. But it&#x27;s his choice.
&gt; 
&gt; Neither I, nor you, know the details that passed between Chris and  
&gt; Frank. Only they could testify to it. It would be a case of he/he  
&gt; said. And what good would it serve anyone? We&#x27;re back to the bull  
&gt; crap of the Edison v. Tesla Gangs.
&gt; 
&gt; This line of conversation needs to ends, HMO.
&gt; 
&gt; Ann
&gt;
 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  So, Ann, You think it&#x27;s OK for Chris to say all the BS he&#x27;s claiming against Us &amp; Frank? That it&#x27;s OK to start up businesses, using (or abusing) Frank&#x27;s Box, to make money from it, to rename Frank&#x27;s box to &quot;The Telephone to the Dead&quot;, etc.  . . . without authorizations from Frank himself?  As a Legal Secretary/assistant &amp; &quot;Independent&quot; Paranormal Investigator, etc. I disagree with you, but THAT&#x27;s OK!   =Judy=  P.S.When you get your box, you can start your bussiness and make money, too, like Chris!! Perhaps that&#x27;s what&#x27;s needed . . . competition!</pre>
