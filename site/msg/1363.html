This is the proto type AM-FM tuner. I&#x27;m adding  mic amps and speaker drivers 
to the blank portion of the board, which will be pretty crowded. I&#x27;m hoping 
to have a board layout done within a week, and get at least this much in 
(limited) production, since the sweep generators are relatively simple. The 
chip is the LA1816, and is a pain to work with since it&#x27;s a shrink dip 24 
package, the pins don&#x27;t fit any boards, or sockets, so it almost has to be 
on a printed board. I used #30 wire-wrap wire to connect to the chip, after 
cutting slots in the perf board to allow the pins to protrude through. My 
first attempt with this chip, I made a socket for it, but couldn&#x27;t get the 
chip to work. Other than the weird pin spacing the chip is pretty easy to 
work with, but you have to watch the grounds, the RF ground is DC isolated 
from the chasis, or DC  return. Then because I&#x27;m using an RF amp for AM 
instead of a bar antenna, I had to add the choke between the antenna input, 
and RF ground. The data sheet showed a 39mh choke, which would have been 
impossibley large, so I used a 2 mh, and it works ok. There always seems to 
be these little &quot;mistakes&quot; on the data sheets. With the LA1135, there is a 
resistor on the data sheet that is ten times to large, which keeps the chip 
from working at all if you use the value on the data sheet. That was the AM 
only chip I used for a recent proto type.

Guess that&#x27;s enough techno drivel!
