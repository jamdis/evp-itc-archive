I didn't realize people thought of me that way frank, sometimes i 
believe my name is used in conjunction to a statement i'm not aware 
of. I don't know much about electronics and that's why if you read 
my post from yesterday i referred Kay to ask you about how the box 
works. I never claimed to know anymore than the next person, i don't 
believe i have an ego either. I'm still learning and always trying 
new things to stay refreshed in what i'm doing here. I know you no 
longer like me for whatever reasons you have, but i don't go bashing 
you on public forums. Some call that cheap shots, i only speak about 
you with respect and will continue to do so. As a matter of fact, 
yesterday i called myself a dopey box researcher. Does that sound 
like i'm above the rest?
