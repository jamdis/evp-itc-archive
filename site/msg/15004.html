I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demod=
ulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne =
principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequ=
ency then if you add or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or =
alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz a=
nd you have an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 4=
5KHz then you will have a intermediate difference=A0frequency at 9KHz, well=
 within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but =
all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turning them =
on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few inc=
hes of the recorder.
=A0
We are able to reproduce this affect in not only r=
adio with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in s=
ome passive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by=
 Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
