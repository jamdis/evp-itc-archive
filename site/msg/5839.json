It probably makes me feel a bit better if nothing is on the recording since I don&#39;t seem to pick anything up anyway.  The &quot;Ask Bruce is a bit of surprise only because I already did ask bruce.  He had suggested I try a direct recording.  \n   \n  This actually brings up a question about what Steve hears.  Is it possible that you are getting a message given to you at the time you are listening to my recording which actually does not have the message?  I must say I am still overwhelmed from getting messages on the other evp maker recording (that others hear).   My pea brain and body are still processing that information.  \n   \n  Laui asked:  I am in Campeche, Campeche, Mexico.  City of, State of.  I can skip a rock across the Gulf to hit Texas or Louisiana.  Ron L  \n\nurkel23@... wrote:\n            I managed to pull out 1 file for you that i thought may be something.

This may be a good opportunity to get help with my technical challange here in Mexico.  I have posted what I recorded from AM signals along the beach here on the Gulf with the recorder patched directly into the RS 12 469.  Most channels are Spanish language although one or two channels skip across the Gulf fromTexas.  So you shouldn&#39;t hear many English words from the radio if any.\n   \n  I am submitting this because, with the help of this group, I recently learned that I have been missing all the messages on my recordings.  That is...I couldn&#39;t hear anything where others with experience hear plenty.\n   \n  My previous post was with EVP maker.  If somethng could be heard on the RS recording patched directly into my recorder that would be another amazing event for me.  I of course hear nothing from the other side.
