Stefan,
 
Myself as well as Steve have been asking questions along the lin=
es of communication advancement since day one.
The problem is we have never=
 received any concrete answers, advice or instruction.
 
In the beginning w=
e did work with technicians and guides on a daily basis Steve and I had the=
 same two techs assigned to us both, Mike and Lisa.
We had developed a grea=
t communication as well as personal relationship with them. As much as coul=
d be developed given the circumstances.
 
About two months ago we all start=
ed to lose contact with our techs and guides, and as far as my communicatio=
n goes and a few other researchers I have discussed this with
The techs are=
 no longer running this communication and contact with them is sporadic and=
 rare. I will hear from Lisa some times but never Mike any more.
 
When que=
stioned the communicating spirits where of course vague in their answers bu=
t more or less explained the techs had moved on.
Possibly we had outgrown t=
heir supervision or they moved on to assist in other areas of communication=
 or simply to continue their spiritual journey's.
We may never know for sur=
e. But that is the tech situation.
 
As far as psychic mediums go, I do bel=
ieve they have some sort of gift, but their communication is based solely o=
n intuition and interpretation rather than actual real time hard line commu=
nication
I think it is more thought and feeling than communication.
 
My op=
inion and that's all it is. Is that our answers and future lye in developin=
g our technology and strength of knowledge and real time communication with=
 other entities that are willing.
 
Bruce
