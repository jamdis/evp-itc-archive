<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi LC,

The two setups I did were:

1) Three 12-469&#x27;s through a mixer, mixed with white noise (performed 
with Audacity), my voice via a microphone, and all that audio 
captured using a free program called &quot;Scanner Recorder&quot;. You can 
download it here: http://www.davee.com/scanrec/
I have not really taken that unit anywhere to test it properly.  I 
only did the original testing you hear on the video.

2) One 12-470 placed in a &quot;chamber&quot;, with a noise generator (used 
a &quot;My Lil&#x27; Reminder&quot; 20 second digital recorder/player) with recorded 
white/pink noise I captured while in Florida.  Also inside is 
a &quot;Listen Up&quot; amplified microphone and an Olympus digital recorder.
The only wiring is a Y-connector which connects the output from the 
amplified mic to the input of the recorder, and also to ear-buds for 
listening to what is being recorded. You can also plug a small 
speaker into this if desired.
The raw audio from the linear sweep of either the AM or FM band is 
projected from the 12-470 speaker, into the closed &quot;chamber&quot;, along 
with the audio from the speaker of the noise generator (&quot;My Lil&#x27; 
Reminder&quot;) unit.  Those two sources, plus any ambient noise inside 
the &quot;chamber&quot; is picked up by the amplified mic and fed into the 
recorder and ear-buds. The recorder produces the .wav file.
You can use a 12-469 instead of the 12-470. You just need to connect 
a small speker to the output of the 12-469.

As with my three 12-469 system, I have so far only done the initial 
test run on th 12-470 system.  I hope to bring both units to a place 
where I can do some better experimentation.  I have 2 weeks off near 
Christmas time, so that is probably when I&#x27;ll be doing that.

I hope I have answered your questions, LC.

- Mike

&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; Today I modified my Radio Shack 12-469, but have some questions.  
It 
&gt; was easy to do, and I instantly plugged it into my Olympus voice 
&gt; recorder and recorded off of it easily.  Now I want to pipe some 
&gt; white noise in (and ambient), as well. 
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Is the set-up in your video what has worked best for you (with 
the 
&gt; computer and all)?
&gt; 2) Will you tell us what free computer programs you used (I think 
one 
&gt; is Audacity)?
&gt; 3) What microphone and white noise generator did you use for your 
&gt; travel pack unit pictured on UFOGeek.com (posted on December 8th)?  
&gt; And can you give me a layout for the wiring of it - you know, how 
it 
&gt; all hooks together?  I&#x27;ll figure it out sooner or later, but I&#x27;d 
&gt; rather it be sooner!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, LC
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I am currently putting together another video, just like my 
others 
&gt; &gt; showing a very practical way to use the Radio Shack Hack devices.
&gt; &gt; You probably saw my 12-469 practical use videos, now I&#x27;m going to 
&gt; be 
&gt; &gt; sharing a 12-470 practical use video.  This one is of a totally 
&gt; &gt; portable system that uses a noise generator, the hacked 12-470, a 
&gt; &gt; digital (or analog) recorder, and a microphone which gathers the 
&gt; raw 
&gt; &gt; audio sweep, white noise (or in my case a special white/pink 
noise 
&gt; file 
&gt; &gt; I created), and any ambient noise within a chamber.. and places 
&gt; that 
&gt; &gt; session int a .wav file.  It also includes an ear piece so you 
can 
&gt; &gt; hear, real time, what the digital recorder is recording (the 
mixer 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; the session sound within the chamber).
&gt; &gt; Stay tuned for that video later today....
&gt; &gt;
