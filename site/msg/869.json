I&#39;m \n&gt;not releasing the test results until Laura finishes the analyzation of her \n&gt;session. It was late and she was tired. However I did some pre-test \n&gt;sessions to clear the channels that I can share some of the sounds. \n&gt;Attaching a few to this post.\n&gt;\n&gt;   I will try and post it all on a webpage later along with the results of \n&gt;our sessions. She couldnt make the 8 session so I began as they asked and \n&gt;did a channel clearing session, no questions asked, just recording. However \n&gt;they were already starting the session so by the time she came and we both \n&gt;sat down and asked the same questions out loud as we recorded most of them \n&gt;were focused on the test at hand.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;LON3_S7AR &lt;lon3_s7ar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;             hey everyone\n&gt;   im looking for some feedback on yalls session :)\n&gt;   would love to hear the evp&#39;s you got last night.\n&gt;   Also, would like to see if you are still planning on &quot;meeting&quot; online on \n&gt;sunday to record?\n&gt;   I think this is an amazing deal. It could bridge so many people together \n&gt;on both side of the spectrum. I think that it would be cool to see how many \n&gt;people are interested in doing this on a regular basis?\n&gt;   I know of another person interested in sundays recording session too.\n&gt;\n&gt;   amy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Amy Sutter\n&gt;\n&gt;www.myspace.com/LON3_S7AR\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Check me out!\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;   It&#39;s here!
