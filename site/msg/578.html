            I know they like to use music. In particular they can make use of certain instruments to propel thier voice across. So last night I played a short clip of Joe Satriani's "always with you always with me" it contains music only, no vocals. I discovered that in the first few seconds of the clip the voices were able to sustain a loud, comprehensive line of communication until Satriani kicked it into high gear and the guitar notes were too loud and drowned everything out. Some could be heard on regular playback, most could be heard clearer at a slowed down rate of -74% & -30%. I then did a session with no music. Both sessions lasted under 1 minute and both sessions had a yeild of about 18 clips/sentences. The difference being that more of the music clips were louder and clearer to understand for me and hopefully for you too. 
   
  Heres a few of the evp clips for you to download and evaluate. Many are very loud so I recommend you lower the sound DOWN... ALOT til you play it once to see what volume level it has. I use stereo speakers so I am used to blasting my head off LOL so careful you dont blow a speaker or your eardrums. Even I usually turn them down because the level of vibration and noise may be too much for my dogs ears. The process I used was the same, p1 filter only, amped at +15 which works differently depending on what comes across and what I used for background sound. When using music the noise level is definitely alot higher and you will need to lower your sound for those LOL
   
  Only sharing some of the ones I think others can hear. The music session had alot more than the nonmusic session. I will send a short clip of satriani (the first part where the voices were the best) so that if anyone wants to give it a try they can.
