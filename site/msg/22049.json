Do you think there are other large forums we don&#39;t know about, besides yours and Bruce&#39;s?  I haven&#39;t been to Tracy&#39;s in a while.  FaceBook is very active now, but I haven&#39;t posted any files there or on YouTube.

When i first joined this group in 2007, it was the only group dedicated to this and it was a rockin&#39; forum.  \n&gt; \n&gt; We used to get between 1500 to 2000 posts a month, now it gets like 15 to 20 posts a month.  Not sure what happened here.  If each member here posted twice a month, it would be like 1800 posts.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sure that somebody has to have something to say.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;athena97531&quot; &lt;athenamarmalade@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Maybe I should post here - it is hard to get any feedback for my files on two other forums.
