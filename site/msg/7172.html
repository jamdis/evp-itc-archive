<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s been my experience that they will use what ever we use. The 
linear scanning of the radio s seems otbe easier fo rth entities to 
track and modify. I even swtiched to using only linear sweep in my 
boxes cuz i think it makes for  easier to understand messages. I have 
one of the hacked Radio Shack radios, and it works, it just scans 
alittle slower than I&#x27;m used to. 

 Honestly, I don&#x27;t know all the much about the paranormal per se`, 
I&#x27;m guided almost entirely by intuition. I&#x27;ve never done an 
investigation, and not sure I believe in hauntings, or accidental 
ghost encounters.

field )
&gt;   I would like to know what your honest opinion of the Ghost Box 
Hacker
&gt; is? or ( Mike&#x27;s box)
&gt;   Can the radio at Radio Shack really do that?
&gt;   Because it us definately a cheap device.
&gt;   You have opened up the door to new possibilities for 
understanding the
&gt; paranormal,
&gt;   and as a person who is searching, I hope that you know how much 
we all
&gt; really
&gt;    respect and admire you.
&gt;    Thankyou for all you have done, and are doing for the future of 
this
&gt; field of study.

&gt; 
&gt; I started in EVP wiht white, then various other noise methods, and 
&gt; eventuallly found EVPmaker on the web. Evepmaker worked reallly 
well 
&gt; fro me, but i kept getting messages realyed from spirits that 
&gt; couldn&#x27;t use the computer, by the ones that could. I was ewondering 
&gt; what else I could use, and after aobut a week, the whole copncept 
of 
&gt; the box kinda popped int my head fully formed. I think it was my 
own 
&gt; subconcious mind that assembeld information from past experience, 
and 
&gt; presented it as a solutuion to the problem. I had worked wijht 
these 
&gt; radio modules from car stereos a few years previous, and knew they 
&gt; cold be voltage tuned, so I come up wiht an analog version of 
&gt; EVPmaker, pretty much.

&gt; &gt; Frank,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; To start off with no I do not want a box. =) 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; However, I do have a question for you when you have time. I was 
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; curious as to where you got the inspiration for the box. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Was it just an idea that popped into your head or did you have 
help
&gt; &gt; from the other side? Not to take any credit away from you at all 
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; your accomplishments with the box. It was just something I was 
&gt; curious
&gt; &gt; about.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I believe I am looking for personal answers from the other side 
but
&gt; &gt; also I feel it may help me with some more general directions I may
&gt; &gt; want to go in after putting my own personal demons to rest. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks for your time in advance.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt; TT
