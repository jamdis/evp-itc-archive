Some based on beliefs \nsome based on research some based on instinct, some just thought it \nup while watching a tv show that led them to join here. Others have \ndecided it doesnt matter who what when where why or how it is being \ndone, just the fact it is happening is enough to keep their interest. \nNot everyone that joins here is a believer. But everyone that joins \nhere is curious and hopefully want to learn more.\n\nI have actually heard this question/idea stated before and \nrementioned recently on a talk show dealing with ufo/government \ntechnology. It was only mentioned as possibility and mentions of \nconducted experiments that were used on people.\n\nLook around you. The world as we see it is indeed a matrix, a peice \nof a peice of a peice of a much larger puzzle.

I live \nin Cary, North Carolina and record when I have the time. There is no \nset schedule, and when I turn my radio on and someone says hello \nMichael, or even shouts out &quot;Mike Edwards&quot;, or a spirit tells me I am \nholding a carving in my hand, who would even know I turned the radio \non? Only my wife knows I record, and we have kept this research from \nour children as well as our neighbors. So you are suggesting that \nMargaret, lets say who lives where I do not know, is playing a joke \non me with a high tech two way radio?\n&gt;  \n&gt; itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Nathan. I always look to relevance as a key in determining \nwhether or not something is appropriate to the session. If this were \na hoax, I would then have to seek an explanation for how private \ninformation is known by the &#39;hoax perp&#39;, particularly information \nthat would require visual awareness. Some of us have examples of \nappropriate responses being given when asking things like, &quot;Can you \nname something nearby me?&quot; or &quot;Please tell me what I&#39;m holding in my \nleft hand.&quot; A sophisticated multi-transmission two way radio would \nnot explain answers which require &#39;visual&#39; information of some kind \n(though I&#39;ll be the first to admit my understanding of electronics is \nlimited but I&#39;m fairly confident on this aspect.) Of course, there is \nalways the chance that the person running the hoax is also, or in \npartnership with, an extremely talented remote viewer or psychic who \nis able to glean that visual information from the ether or the mind \nof the experimenter. And what of those examples where people have \nconfirmed the sound of the voice being &quot;just like&quot; that of their \nloved one in spirit? Surely the hoaxer isn&#39;t also able to mimic \npeople&#39;s loved ones.If you are using EVP Maker with anything other \nthan the allophones file, which contains no words to begin with, you \nare also running the possibility of &#39;false positives&#39; albeit they \nwouldn&#39;t be from a hoax. Again, I look to relevance to be key, and \nrelevant info that would not come easily to a stranger is even \nbetter. For example, I turned on my MiniBox for the very first time \nand said, &quot;Hello?&quot; and immediately received the response, &quot;Hello \nMargaret.&quot; If this were a hoax, how could that person know in less \nthan 10 seconds, who I was by name. I had not given this information \nout. Not to mention that you have people experimenting 24/7 and \nreceiving similar responses. How in the world could an organization \nhave the manpower, technology, or even the desire, to attempt such a \nhoax? I mean that as a genuine inquiry, because there might be an \nexplanation I have not thought of. I have one example where, via \nradio sweep, my communicator was able to correctly identify the \nstatus and location of a missing person (who it turns out was alive \nand well, so we ended up with confirmation that the info given had \nindeed been correct - which is much less complicated that trying to \ntrack and understand the clues when associated with the dead, or \nmissing but not found.) Again, if a hoax, would that have simply been \na lucky guess on the part of the hoaxer?Bottom line for me is ... \nhave I wondered if it could be a hoax? Or simply a fortuitous tuning \nof the dial? Yes, on both accounts. But there is enough compelling \nevidence to rule out both of them as an explanation for the far too \nmany relevant examples received by so many of us.Good food for \nthought, but after digesting it, I&#39;d have to say, &quot;No, a \nsophisticated hoax does not sufficiently explain the phenomena on a \nlarge scale.&quot;Margaret--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Nathan Sharman \n&lt;v1230mail@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Has it ever occurred to you, that some one or&gt; \norganisation, could be using a radio to say the things&gt; you heard?&gt; &gt; \nThis whole radio and spirit voices, could be a MASSIVE&gt; HOAX, \nperpetuated by some one with a sophisticated&gt; multi-transmission two \nway radio.&gt; &gt; Think about it.&gt; &gt; THAT IS WHY I USE EVPmaker only to \ncommuincate with&gt; the other dimension.&gt; &gt; \n__________________________________________________&gt; Do You Yahoo!?&gt; \nTired of spam?
