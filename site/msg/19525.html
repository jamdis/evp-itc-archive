well clearly I'm alittle bias...but if you ask around anyone will tell it i=

eally the only full spec camera without paying a arm and a leg. I was recom=
mened the cam by Andy from the other group and he works i some sort of engi=
neer. But I can only suggest.So I hope your happy with your choice. The spe=

s no big deal what matter is weather it is trully a full specter cam. I was=
 going with that brand myself until I researched the product..I never Jump =

nother like source with this."Moditronics' so-called "Full Spectrum" (which=

better result with a full spectrum...and if you can get one why settle for =
less. But thats just the sorta person i am.

Thanks!
