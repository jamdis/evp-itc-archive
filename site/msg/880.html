Nice find Frank, I&#x27;m sure that kit would do the the job coupled to a motor which in turn is coupled to the tuning dial of a radio. Maybe there is enough random information to do a simple sweep, the radio signals are constantly modulated with changing information. The part that has got me thinking is how some of the voices drag across several different stations and sound like the same voice. At first thought it appears to have something to do with amplitude variation and time. I can sometimes get the &#x27;dragging voice&#x27; effect using EVP maker, it is not nearly as clean as the radio method. I have to look through my stuff in the basement, I think I may have a Delco auto-tuning car radio from about 1970 that was mechanical.
I&#x27;m attaching a reverse playback message from today.

This is from Gateway Electronics, they used to have a store here, but closed 
it. I almost bought one of these! This would be great for tuning a radio, 
and I bet it would be farly easy to randonly control, but that may not be 
necessary, maybe like Dave said, just steady tuning acorss the band, back 
and forth?
