<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Frank, I found this external sweeper circuit in a book, and I believe it to have a problem. It is a linear sweep circuit, and I keep frying resistors on the initial voltage divider. I don&#x27;t think that the 10 ohm value is correct as listed. I know little to nothing about electronics, but I am trying to learn. On the breadboard I keep cooking off 1/2 watt resistors, and by the voltage calculators I found online, using those values seems to be putting close to 2 watts though the resistors. I can only think that the 10 ohm divider values are wrong, but I don&#x27;t know what they should be.

I think I will just try your circuit, although it is a bit intimidating to a newbie, lol. I have no problem assembling pcb stuff according to directions, but the actual building and experimenting with, well I am still trying to learn. 

Thanks so much for your contributions with the schematics. I am looking forward to making an externally sweep tuned 469 or 820.

thanks 
Andy

&gt;  Well, if I could draw this stuff accurately it might help. There was some mistakes in the random section of the sweep circuit. So I replaced the sweep schematic in my folder.
