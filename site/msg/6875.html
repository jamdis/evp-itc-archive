<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks, glad it&#x27;s just not me noticing that stuff. I wouldn&#x27;t mind, 
it probably helps get some attention to this stuff, but it also helps 
carry on the old Hollywood versions of spirit.

&gt; I just got to add to FS&#x27; point with respect to Paranormal State.  
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone notice Ron Milione (TAPS gadget electronics expert) appeared 
&gt; on Paranormal State as now a &quot;demon expert,&quot; identifying an EVP on 
&gt; the show as a &quot;demon&quot; by the sound of its voice on the recording?
&gt; 
&gt; Then I saw Ron on the History Channel&#x27;s UFO Hunters as a UFO 
&gt; researcher/expert.  I&#x27;m trying to keep count, but that makes him a 
&gt; electronics guru, UFO expert and demonologist!  Nice guy, but I 
think 
&gt; he just has a great agent that can get him these &quot;roles.&quot;  
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I saw a lady have her home investigated by the Penn State 
bunch 
&gt; on Paranormal State and supposedly in need of their help, then I 
turn 
&gt; the channel and see her as a paranormal investigator on Ghost 
Hunters 
&gt; International!  She must have a great agent, too.  ;)

&gt; &gt;  At the risk of being negative yet again, all I can say is --You 
&gt; have got to be friggin&#x27; kidding!? No wonder all the &#x27;serious 
&gt; researchers&#x27; call it entertainment, cuz shows like that put this 
work 
&gt; back with Barnum and Baily! I think they take urban myths, like the 
&gt; haunted piano, and do a show on it, with all actors. Their 
&gt; demonolgist supposedly worked on the Amityville case, ya mean the 
&gt; Hollywood version, cuz the real case was nothin!?  Just watch the 
&gt; people involved, and you can tell they are actors, with speech 
&gt; training, not a single um, ah, or stutter ever uttered! It&#x27;s all 
just 
&gt; too well rehearshed and scripted for me to watch any more of it.
