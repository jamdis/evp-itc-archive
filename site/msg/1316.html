I used his message to the people of New Zealand. Ive gotten alot of clear voices using various raw audio with that program I just never tried to associate the audio file with the relevance of the words that came thru.

          Misty--OMG. This is amazing. What live recordings did you feed into EVPMaker?   

  I wonder if working with their own voice in EVPmaker makes it easier for them to construct an EVP? These are some of the clearest EVP through EVPmaker that I have ever heard. I am really astounded.

  I also included the evp vs life speech side by side comparison with the evp I got from ST method. Since thats how this started and for those who just joined group and have no idea what I am talkin about.
