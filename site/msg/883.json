It&#39;s lined with aluminum foil, and has \na quartz sphere in the apex. I used to use it as the echo box, and still \nhave a speaker mounted in it. The pyramid was part of a larger meditation \npyamid, over six feet tall, but I only use the top, made of 3/4 inch copper \npipe. Hmmm, wonder if I need a pyramidal enlosure for the system?\n\nFrank\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] a stepper motor controller kit.\n&gt;Date: Tue, 20 Mar 2007 16:16:36 -0700\n&gt;\n&gt;Nice find Frank, I&#39;m sure that kit would do the the job coupled to a motor \n&gt;which in turn is coupled to the tuning dial of a radio. Maybe there is \n&gt;enough random information to do a simple sweep, the radio signals are \n&gt;constantly modulated with changing information. The part that has got me \n&gt;thinking is how some of the voices drag across several different stations \n&gt;and sound like the same voice. At first thought it appears to have \n&gt;something to do with amplitude variation and time. I can sometimes get the \n&gt;&#39;dragging voice&#39; effect using EVP maker, it is not nearly as clean as the \n&gt;radio method. I have to look through my stuff in the basement, I think I \n&gt;may have a Delco auto-tuning car radio from about 1970 that was mechanical.\n&gt;I&#39;m attaching a reverse playback message from today.\n&gt;&quot;Pyramids helpful.....That&#39;s a secret&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Dave\n&gt;\n&gt;--- franks-boxes@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;From: &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] a stepper motor controller kit.\n&gt;Date: Tue, 20 Mar 2007 13:44:31 -0600\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This is from Gateway Electronics, they used to have a store here, but \n&gt;closed\n&gt;it. I almost bought one of these! This would be great for tuning a radio,\n&gt;and I bet it would be farly easy to randonly control, but that may not be\n&gt;necessary, maybe like Dave said, just steady tuning acorss the band, back\n&gt;and forth?\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Interest Rates near 39yr lows! $430,000 Mortgage for $1,399/mo - Calculate\n&gt;new payment\n&gt;http://www.lowermybills.com/lre/index.jsp?sourceid=lmb-9632-18466&moid=7581\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;&lt;&lt; 032007reversepyramidshelpfulthatsecret.mp3 &gt;&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\ni&#39;m making a difference.���Make every IM count for the cause of your choice. \nJoin Now. \nhttp://clk.atdmt.com/MSN/go/msnnkwme0080000001msn/direct/01/?href=http://im.live.com/messenger/im/home/?source=hmtagline"}
