I \nsometimes have to turn my volume down because the loud crackle static \nis often more voice layers that can only be heard at lower volume.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I tried using oboe music...supposedly the oboe is one of the \ninstruments which closely replicates the human voice in sound. Not \ngreat results wise, for me. They like the guitar better. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   They also like it if I sing/hum. Little known fact about me, I \nsometimes have musical compositions and entire songs pop into my head \nin an instant and it will bug me until i sing it, hum it, or write \nthe words down....once I do then I can go on with life as usual LOL \nthe problem is I am about as musical as I am technical. I dont play \nan instrument and I have never studied music so theres no way I can \nwrite down half of what I hear but I jot the words, hum the tune, \nwhatever and get it out of my system.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I have one here someplace I recorded with me singing/humming and \nevp/someone else doing backup and singing along with me. What that&#39;s \nall about I still couldn&#39;t tell you. Strange but true and kinda \nfreakish. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Either way just try some music out guys, play it low, anything \nwithout words is preferable.\n&gt;   Record and see what pops up.

In particular they can make use of \n&gt; certain instruments to propel thier voice across. So last night I \n&gt; played a short clip of Joe Satriani&#39;s &quot;always with you always with \n&gt; me&quot; it contains music only, no vocals. I discovered that in the \nfirst \n&gt; few seconds of the clip the voices were able to sustain a loud, \n&gt; comprehensive line of communication until Satriani kicked it into \n&gt; high gear and the guitar notes were too loud and drowned everything \n&gt; out. Some could be heard on regular playback, most could be heard \n&gt; clearer at a slowed down rate of -74% & -30%. I then did a session \n&gt; with no music. Both sessions lasted under 1 minute and both \nsessions \n&gt; had a yeild of about 18 clips/sentences. The difference being that \n&gt; more of the music clips were louder and clearer to understand for \nme \n&gt; and hopefully for you too. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Heres a few of the evp clips for you to download and evaluate. \n&gt; Many are very loud so I recommend you lower the sound DOWN... ALOT \n&gt; til you play it once to see what volume level it has. I use stereo \n&gt; speakers so I am used to blasting my head off LOL so careful you \ndont \n&gt; blow a speaker or your eardrums. Even I usually turn them down \n&gt; because the level of vibration and noise may be too much for my \ndogs \n&gt; ears. The process I used was the same, p1 filter only, amped at +15 \n&gt; which works differently depending on what comes across and what I \n&gt; used for background sound. When using music the noise level is \n&gt; definitely alot higher and you will need to lower your sound for \n&gt; those LOL\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Only sharing some of the ones I think others can hear. The music \n&gt; session had alot more than the nonmusic session. I will send a \nshort \n&gt; clip of satriani (the first part where the voices were the best) so \n&gt; that if anyone wants to give it a try they can.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Misty\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Check out the all-new Yahoo!
