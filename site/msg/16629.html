<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That doesn&#x27;t surprise me at all.  I wish someone could figure out why using the box enhances one&#x27;s abilities as a medium, but apparently this is so -- I know it was true for me.  As much experience as you have, Frank, it would seem to follow you&#x27;d have built up some considerable ability.

&gt;  Went to the medium development class last night and OMG! Suprised myselff,
&gt; had no idea I could get visions on demand like that. I am uncertain if it
&gt; was due to being in a group with those expectations though. I&#x27;ve never
&gt; attempted to read for anyone before, always seems kinda presumptuous to me.
&gt; They do a circle for exchanging messages the third Friday of the month.
