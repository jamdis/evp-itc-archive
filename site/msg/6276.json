Now that you mention the 20-125, I remember\nreading about Steve hacking it.  \n\nI&#39;ve got the 12-469 & 70 burned in my brain.  Every time I&#39;m near a\nRadio Shack, I stop in to see if they have an older 470.  I will\ncertainly try out the 20-125.  \n\nI had actually been seriously thinking about getting a Mini Box, but\nthat&#39;s a hefty price tag.  Especially since I have no experience with\nbox research at this point.  \n\nJeremy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, juli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeremy:        IF you are unable to find an old 470 and you dont\ncare for the clicking on the 69, why don&#39;t you try the 20-125?  This\nhas the internal speaker and you can hack that as well.  I believe\nSteve has directions on his site, keyportparanormal.com.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Good luck!\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Juli\n&gt; \n&gt; ecuyler &lt;ecuyler@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           I just read on the Paranormal Systems website that they\nare developing\n&gt; a new box called the MaxiBox. It has a lot of features I&#39;ve heard\n&gt; Bruce mention that would be beneficial to the boxes. \n&gt; \n&gt; Hell, I&#39;ve been trying my best to locate an older 12-470 to modify so\n&gt; I could start doing the research. I know there is the 12-469, but\n&gt; I&#39;ve been hesitant because of all the talk about the annoying click. \n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                          \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private &\nconfidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is\naddressed to.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;   No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or\nforwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.\n&gt;"}
