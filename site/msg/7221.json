In the case of the MegaBox, it&#39;s a more useful\nversion than just a straight 470 hack since that mixer is integrated.\nThese incremental improvements are also inspiring for those like me\nwho like to sketch drawings of the Ultimate Box. -Bill\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, dave vacknitz &lt;cycron@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Yah its just a radio hack in a box, like they said,\n&gt; nothin special. Just our first time using it. But we\n&gt; are working on a few new a thoughts about how to\n&gt; improve it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Dave \n&gt; www.apartofwa.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- psi_research &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; LC is not kidding, that&#39;s exactly what it is, it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; got a intact 469\n&gt; &gt; inside. Check out the link he supplied, they did the\n&gt; &gt; same thing with\n&gt; &gt; an older model 470 and added a tiny line mixer and\n&gt; &gt; called it a\n&gt; &gt; MegaBox. Well I guess why reinvent the wheel? With\n&gt; &gt; that said I believe\n&gt; &gt; there are some fresh new approaches to scrambled\n&gt; &gt; audio that will debut\n&gt; &gt; soon. -Bill\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://deadscience.com/index.php?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; option=com_gallery2&Itemid=30&g2_itemId=165\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s a 12-469 inside of a box which has an\n&gt; &gt; external mounted amplified \n&gt; &gt; &gt; speaker with volume control. ;)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.apartofwa.com/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;      \n____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and \n&gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
