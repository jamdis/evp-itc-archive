I&#39;ve belonged to the group for 3-4\n&gt; days. Your reputation and experience/experiments were  the main reason and I\n&gt; learned afterwards of the others with experience.  I can only apologize if\n&gt; my question was the straw.  Thank you for explaining the history, Frank.\n&gt;  Sorry it&#39;s been so wearing on you.

Due to one of these\n&gt; &gt; incessent argurments, I had to back away from this some years ago as I\n&gt; &gt; almost got fired becuase yet someone else that thought they knew so much\n&gt; &gt; more forwarded all my e-mails to my boss.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then someone else seemed to be insinuating that I may have tampered with\n&gt; &gt; the imgaes. Very insulting. This stuff goes on an on, regardless of the\n&gt; &gt; quality of voices, or the images. I have reached my saturation point. There\n&gt; &gt; seems to be nothing more to be gained by presenting anything else. Now, I\n&gt; &gt; can sympatize with Richard Roberts!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The group will continue, as there are a number of box and paranormal\n&gt; &gt; experts here that are more than happy to tell everyone what this stuff\n&gt; &gt; really is and how it works.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t mean to create bad any feelings.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Adrienne&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;abortree@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for getting back to me. I thought I had destroyed the group by\n&gt; &gt; accident. Awful feeling!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I completely understand and am very grateful that he started this group\n&gt; &gt; and is willing to share and let share ideas and files. God forbid he should\n&gt; &gt; leave!! I&#39;m not used to looking at video this way so it would be easy for me\n&gt; &gt; to miss a lot. I did see the Upside Down Lincoln and the face at the end in\n&gt; &gt; the second attachment of &quot;If this is the only one...&quot; I need more practice\n&gt; &gt; and a more open mind, I think. This is all so far reaching. Thank goodness\n&gt; &gt; he, especially (and the others in this group) are doing this and sharing\n&gt; &gt; these ideas.

It seems to be a normal function of our own\n&gt; &gt; minds(living or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dead), the same as reverse speech. I found some faces in old EVPs\n&gt; &gt; from boxes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and also in music files. The ones from Evanescence are pretty\n&gt; &gt; impressive in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person, and do not seem to be intentionaly embedded.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know, it&#39;s not ghost hunters, and most don&#39;t want to have to\n&gt; &gt; think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think most want this stuff in a neat little box, all well\n&gt; &gt; defined, all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rules and protocols known, but it just won&#39;t stay in one box, or\n&gt; &gt; universe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for that matter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Frank,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think that I see what you mean. I mean no offense, but I it would\n&gt; &gt; be helpful to see something a little more definitive that couldn&#39;t be\n&gt; &gt; mistaken for matrixing. Is this possible?
