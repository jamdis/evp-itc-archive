Hi,
I am Sonny Psychic from Liveperson.com, I've had so many strange things=
 happen!

Out of my EVP experiences, just yesterday my radio told me to loo=
k out-side (it said "window" that's all!)and I saw a guy picking up his dog=
's off my lawn! It described the situation so well, because I like to catch=
 this one person in particular. He was picking it up, and that's what the s=
pirit was showing me. But the spirit was also talking about a window to cha=
nge my life and that the person picking "it" up, has changed too.
Sonny Psy=
chic
