I've been into the Paranormal for 33 years,and I agree about picking up 
different evps off multi digital recorders on a investigation,we even pick up 
responses off camcorders and not on recordesr.When using FB boxes # 77-# 80 we 
always use digital recorders/cams...We always get evps and recordings with out 
any of the FB boxes...When using the boxes brings a whole new aspect to 
responses.I have more luck on FM sweep,but the responses I get are just too 
unreal.Had a friend over a couple weeks ago and he "Didn't believe" in anything 
in this field,I asked the Q: Whats Al doing tomorrow? Answer: going home..Next 
Q: hows he getting there? Answer: Flying on plane.......I have asked the Q..Are 
you from past present or future amd get some wild answers......
