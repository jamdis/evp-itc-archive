<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks a bunch kristin!

Signed up for the esnips account as well. Guess I&#x27;ll stick with the 12-469 for the time being or at least until I become more proficient in making out or hearing the evps and discussions more clearly.


I&#x27;m pretty sure I have about Zero medium ship or sensitivity to spirits and it seems to be somewhat of a recurring theme that it helps out greatly if you do on many sites.

If that&#x27;s the case lol well I may never hear much of anything. As I&#x27;ve never seen a ghost apparition, shadow, heard any footsteps voices or strange noises.

Anyhow hope that&#x27;s not the case.


Again thanks for the info.


Shane

&gt; Hi Shane.  The 12-469 comes with clicking.  Many people actually get so used
&gt; to it that they end up preferring it.  There are other radios that have been
&gt; hacked.. 12-820 Radio Shack armband which I believe is being discontinued,
&gt; the RS 20-125, and I believe a Sangean..  Go to my friend Steve Hultay&#x27;s
&gt; website www.keyportparanormal.com &lt;http://www.keyportparanormal.com/&gt;  for a
&gt; complete list and instructions on how to hack these different models.  He
&gt; also has some You Tube videos of each radio scanning.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; You can step up and purchase a Minibox which offers an adjustable sweep rate
&gt; from Paranormal Systems.  They are on the expensive side but they are
&gt; awesome boxes and Rick offers lay-away plans.  There is also a FM box by Joe
&gt; Cioppi that I personally love called of course Joe&#x27;s Box.  Like Frank Joe
&gt; makes them by himself so these aren&#x27;t out there to purchase like a
&gt; storefront. Don&#x27;t forget that an older Knob style radio works great for a
&gt; manual sweep which many swear by it.  You probably already have a knob dial
&gt; radio in your house right now!  Just sweep up and down the dial at a pace
&gt; that just hits each station.  Don&#x27;t linger but don&#x27;t go so fast that no
&gt; sound is heard.  Frank makes wonderful boxes - the original &quot;Franks Box&quot; -
&gt; but he does not sell them.  
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; As for hosting audio I use www.ESNIPS.com &lt;http://www.esnips.com/&gt;  .  It
&gt; allows 5GB of free space to upload your files. 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this helps.

&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Hi and a couple of questions
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; First off my name is Shane. I just recently (past few weeks) heard about
&gt; ghost boxes. 
&gt; 
&gt; I watched a few videos and read some stuff on building several different
&gt; types (modifying existing devices).
&gt; 
&gt; I started with the 12-469 the completely white one. My first go around not
&gt; much happened but the second go around I got the same name twice and a hello
&gt; and a response of good after I asked how they were doing. 
&gt; 
&gt; I haven&#x27;t had much time to really dig into it good, but one thing is
&gt; glaringly obvious is the annoying and constant ticking sound it makes is
&gt; there anyway to disable this or should I just move to a different radio?
&gt; 
&gt; I chose this one because of the cost and 2 because of the various footage I
&gt; saw and their results. I just didn&#x27;t notice the horrific ticking as it
&gt; scanned through the AM band. ( I haven&#x27;t had any luck with FM and haven&#x27;t
&gt; tried much since it seems to find so many stations and doesn&#x27;t sweep through
&gt; fast enough kinda invalidating anything I might have caught.)
&gt; 
&gt; Second is there a sight you recommend for hosting files that a good
&gt; contingent of people see as reputable?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt; 
&gt; Shane
