&gt; Unfortunately Mr Wegrzyn, your threats to me constitute criminal

&gt; Here&#x27;s what you said:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Get off Franks back...Or I&#x27;ll find you and you dont want that...get with
&gt; it or GET LOST...Thats my opion,let me know Frank and I&#x27;ll take a road
&gt; trip.I got laid off today and I&#x27;m in the mood to screw something or someone
&gt; up !!!!!&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Mr Wegrzyn. did you mean that threat? I am considering filing a police
&gt; report, but I am willing to give you a chance to reexplain what you meant,
&gt; or take it back, since as you said, you did get laid off and all.

&gt;   Thanks April. I also don&#x27;t understand the vehemence of the comments to
&gt; me.   All I can figure, is that some people here have had their deeply held
&gt; beliefs attacked previously by those calling themselves or acting like
&gt; skeptics or scientists.  They compare me to them, and so connect my tests
&gt; and questions as heralding more attacks on their beliefs.
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t in the least condone attacking people&#x27;s beliefs, much less
&gt; attacking them personally (as unfortunately people here are attacking me
&gt; now).

&gt; For the record, I appreciate RJ&#x27;s contribution here, and what he is trying
&gt; to accomplish with these tests. No one should have any problem not the
&gt; skeptics, nor the believers. The outcome of the tests won&#x27;t mean anything to
&gt; anyone except those who wish to remain objective. I do not understand why
&gt; some people here are so threatened by these tests.

&gt; Is it because I don&#x27;t believe everything you do? I don&#x27;t attack you because
&gt; of that.
&gt; So why do you feel it necessary to attack me?

&gt; Here&#x27;s a reason for you to leave this group RJ
&gt; How about we don&#x27;t particularly want you here, and you are pissing Frank
&gt; off......
&gt; Is that enough of a hint ?????
&gt; We don&#x27;t care what you think of us or what we are doing....
&gt; Start your own group, or find one that actually likes you.

&gt;
&gt;   Since my personal results do not show anything paranormal,  I ask
&gt; experts to help with the tests: the experts being the people here. That I
&gt; way I can learn.  I have contributed a testing process so far, run several
&gt; public tests, and even though they were not positive results, I did not
&gt; &quot;tout it all over the web&quot;.  I have not criticized.  I just don&#x27;t
&gt; automatically believe everything people tell me.
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t understand why you would think that should be reason to be kicked
&gt; out of the group.

&gt;  That is really obnoxious! Like no one knows all you want to do is build up
&gt; a list of failed predictions so you can tout it out all over the web and
&gt; make a name for yourself. There are some here that suggest you be kicked off
&gt; the group cuz you contribute nothing, can&#x27;t do any recordings of your own,
&gt; can&#x27;t hear any of the EVPs, can&#x27;t see any of the images, yet are quick to
&gt; criticize and test everyone else.

&gt;  Same old thing, heard them talking about &quot;it hits the earth&quot; again last
&gt; night while testing one of those single supply dual sweep boxes, so set up a
&gt; hack radio I had handy.

&gt; The jack thing is Jack FM, 105.5 FM a rock station. Presumable 2012. The
&gt; December 21st date from the Mayans seems to be a middle number, there&#x27;s like
&gt; a window right around Christmas, as they seem to mention the 17th along with
&gt; this stuff. Who knows if it means anything, but what I don&#x27;t like are those
&gt; that profess to &quot;know better&quot;.
