Hey there, stop that April, hehe, way back spirit use to materialize vocal  
cords, if given enough ectoplasm and they could speak out in mid air, or 
use a  metal trumpet like thing, I have an old banged up one, im going to use 
it today  with the RS 125, and see what happens, put it inside the lower end 
of the  trumpet, with the mic, near the PC and let them talk away, the PC 
does the  recording, it might help them, who knows until it's tried.  they 
use to  form cords inside the trumpet out of this substance  called  ectoplasm 
and talk independently like that one time.

try to combine them some how, and see what happens, maybe put some  light 
wires  inside the box near where the vibration comes out?   Don't see how a 
crystal helps, it's just glass, and there is no where for  them to create 
ectoplasm like threads on glass, try two tiny wires, (I see  u, stop laughing).

There was speaking machines back in the 1800s that had  mechanical vocal 
cords. It still seems easiest for them to manipulate the  electrical signals 
though.

Frank do you think it's similar to what was used in 20's and 30's  by 
mediums, where a trumpet (long piece of aluminum metal cone light  weight shaped 
device) was used, it was a form spirit to form  their own vocal cords in mid 
air.  Perhaps, you should set up a  test, try asking something of the 
spirit that you do not know, where it  could be verified later, that way it won't 
have any physical  influence.  I remember voices easily, it's the work I 
do, so I do  recognize my mother's voice, I do think you are all onto some 
thing  here, which should one day be as the air plane, who every thought humans 
 would one day fly?  Try some light weight metal object in the box,  maybe 
it would help, maybe shaped like a pair of vocal cords, with  folds see it 
that helps. sf

I make the boxes and I don't know, it seems to be a  natural ability that 
most spirits have. Thoughts can interact with the  electronics, and even 
"voices" of the living can come through, in that  way I think we can create what 
we are expecting to hear. 
 

When I first started making this stuff, I gort my wifes  "voice" as she was 
stepping in the shower, upstairs, "I'll be out in  two minutes", in her 
voces, throught he box. It's seems to be more  difficult to conciously form 
voices, kinda like doing PK, it's more of  a subconcious function. Of course 
that was with the radnom sweep,  linear sweep seems to work a little 
differently, and seems to take  more ability, or effort. 
 
 The voices seem to made inside the electronics, you can  record with no 
sound output, and still get the same kind of results.  Even that could support 
that suggestion that it's imagination, in that  we'd still hear the same 
stuff in the chopped up audio, not that I  believe that. 
 
 Someone needs to study this stuff that hasn't already made  up their minds 
what it is.

Hi, I have a question for those who use a box instead of radio,  where do 
spirit get the ability to talk with a box?  Are there  certain channels going 
by with the box as is like a radio?  sf
