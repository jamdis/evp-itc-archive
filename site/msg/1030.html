 computer you can go to weirdstuff.com and get $79 dollar dual p3 
 server (you will have to get some USED ecc memoryfrom ebay--dont buy 
 the new stuff)  i promise that tyan masterpiece will make your other 
 electronics behave, too.  you will be dumdfounded at how FAST 1.2 ghz 
 can be.  windows 2000 professional is only operating system that 
 works.  you need a free reg cleaner "advanced windows care" (google 
 it)
 
 you will have no more burns.
 
 alternatively,
 
 you can get fast , LOW VOLTAGE xeon cpus, dual server board like
 
 tyan i7501, (only use tyan and only server board) and 
 UNDERCLOCK!!!!!!!  , yes thats right, for a 3 gig i underclock to 1.6 
 ghz.  hyperthreading must always be disabled ( unless you want to be 
 a slave to cooked cpu or unless you have "otto" handy)
 
 my ultra low voltage dual xeon running at 1.6ghz beats the pants of 3 
 gig p4 in every test that matters

 Asking it to stop seems to invite worse. This interference has (I

 stuff...in any case..Its good to know Im not the only one whos gone 
 through this....so gathering my dignity...anyone here know if theres 
 any reason to be concerned about EMF levels? I sure am getting mild 
 flu like symptoms fairly regularly...used to be "not so mild"

 equipment, and havent had much problems on my end.

 the sound card, clean the contacts, then replace it to see if that 
 helps. UNPLUG IT FROM ELECTRIC FIRST! If that doesnt help then you 
 may need to replace the part. Keep an eye on temperatures if 
 something is running hot sometimes it will cause the metal to 
 swell/bend/melt/move.
