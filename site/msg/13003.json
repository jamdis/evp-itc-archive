Nice to hear from you. Being that I wasn&#39;t there and I=A0and many=\r\n of my associates on this forum and others have had very strange experience=\r\ns also, I will take your words for truth.=A0To bad you got broke in the way=\r\n you did. It sounds like you are a tad bit clairaudient. This is a talent m=\r\nost of us have to work at but there are those who it comes natural to. A lo=\r\nt of people on this forum are so deep into EVP/ITC they forget they could b=\r\ne committed for the voices they hear also. Shame on them for anything but e=\r\nncouraging words. Hell, I have a friend who is adept at recording with wate=\r\nr and an aquaintance here in my hometown who can hear the voices directly f=\r\nrom running water without a playback. So its not too crazy to believe what =\r\nhas happened to you.\n\nWhile reading your story the overwhelming theme was f=\r\near. You were constantly afraid of what would happen if you did this or tha=\r\nt. If you followed their instructions by opening the door or anything else =\r\nthey did. It was all engineered to instill and create fear in you! You are =\r\ntoo afraid! Normally if you were just dabbling with this stuff I would say =\r\nleave it alone because your not ready. Since you seem to have had it thrust=\r\n upon you I will share some information with you.\n\nVery near our own physic=\r\nal plane is a very dark plane where the barely=A0conscious, materialistic a=\r\nnd flesh obsessed spirits exist and dwell. Some are completely benign and o=\r\nthers entertain themselves with the misery of others. There are also those =\r\nwho constantly ask for your help. The meaner of the ones I mentioned will c=\r\nuss and pick, lie to you and threaten but besides maybe some minor physical=\r\n (haunting) activity they are really physically harmless. On a psychologica=\r\nl level they can be very damaging if you are not prepared for their antics.=\r\n One of the things you need to know about this dark ring around our physica=\r\nl world is that it is monitored by controllers or gatekeepers. They allow o=\r\nnly certain things to pass from level to level. Most of the spirits of this=\r\n area are aware of their presence and some are not. \n\nIf you hear from thes=\r\ne spirits again deal with them as you would with any person giving you prob=\r\nlems. Tell them with authority you want to speak with the gatekeeper. It is=\r\n a term they know, I have heard them use it. If the gatekeeper comes on and=\r\n you trust it to be one then request that the former channel be closed and =\r\nrequest a new (higher) channel of communication.\n\nRemember, like attracts l=\r\nike and fear generates hate. Do not be afraid of these things, they are aro=\r\nund you whether you hear them or not. If you want more information please e=\r\nmail me privately.\n\nRegards,\nFrank R.\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n=\r\nFrom: chuck255 &lt;chuck255@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wedne=\r\nsday, December 3, 2008 1:46:27 PM\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] Any insight on my life=\r\n changing EVP experience?\n\n\nMy name is Chuck and I stumbled upon this site =\r\nand its information \nwhile trying to figure out what&#39;s going on in my crazy=\r\n life. Before I \nget into that let me explain a bit about myself. I am a ma=\r\nle in his \n30&#39;s, who has Bachelors in Regional Development, with a minor in=\r\n \nComputer Science. I work at a respective power plant company within \nAriz=\r\nona doing GIS Tech Work. I get drug tested at it on random \noccasion and I =\r\nreally only drink socially, or on some holiday \noccasions. I have always be=\r\nen a logical kind of thinker my whole life \nand never really had any &quot;belie=\r\nf&quot; in the paranormal, even though my \nmom and brother strongly do. \n\nI feel=\r\n so weird even trying to explain this story because about a \nweek ago I wou=\r\nld have thought of it as silly. About a year ago I met \nsomeone else, who f=\r\nor now ill call B. I fell madly in love with her \nand after a short time I =\r\nwas more than happy to have her come and \nlive with me at my new place. In =\r\nsome strange way I always felt as if \nthere was something about B I could n=\r\never quite understand. After \nabout 3-4 months of living with her I started=\r\n to get the inclination \nthat B was cheating on me. Her stories never added=\r\n up, her job was \nsecretive and she started stumbling on her words a lot. \n=\r\n\nI then started getting spy gadgets, because she was staying with me \nand I=\r\n was concerned about my place along with her activities there. I \nat first =\r\njust got a digital recorder, but then after time I started \nto get aggravat=\r\ned and felt that the digital recordings were just \nbeing used to play and t=\r\naunt me. So then I went to the extent of \ngetting Cameras and even Camcorde=\r\nrs. Whenever I would ask about \nsomething peculiar, I got tears and a reall=\r\ny heartfelt reaction that \nreally made me believe her. I felt like we reall=\r\ny loved one another \nand I could really see some care in her eyes, so most =\r\nof the time I \njust gave in to what she said as true, but didnt have enough=\r\n to stop \nlooking. I felt like I had been in enough relationships to know t=\r\nhe \ndifference here. I have seen the act before and it really didn&#39;t look \n=\r\nthat way here, unless she was just really that good at fooling \npeople. \n\nD=\r\nuring the course of our stay there she would pitch a huge fit if I \nhad to =\r\nleave her at the apartment alone and would stop at nothing to \ntry and be i=\r\nn my company instead. But I started to get aggravated as \ntime progressed a=\r\nnd knew something was up, because of the odd voices \nI would hear within th=\r\ne recordings. I made her stay there will trying \nto sneak back and see who =\r\nwas messing with her around my place. I \nlost it because I couldn&#39;t pinpoin=\r\nt it at all and last July and got \ninto a fight right outside of my place w=\r\nith three other people. She \nalways told me she talked to her self when I q=\r\nestioned other voices \nand I never could see anyone else there when she did=\r\n, even with the \ncameras, so I had no choice but to continue on believeing =\r\nher still=85=85\neven though my feelings wouldn&#39;t agree to her words. \n\nFor =\r\nsome odd reason it just seemed as if she knew where the cameras \nand record=\r\ners were every time, just by the way she would exit and \nenter the apartmen=\r\nt. So then I started putting them outside and about \na month ago something =\r\ncrazy happened. I started listening to a \ndigital recording and at the begi=\r\nnning of it I flat out heard B \ncheating on me with someone. I was upset an=\r\nd happy at the same time \nthat I finally had caught it and as a result I se=\r\nnt her away. She \nleft town because all her family was in another city. She=\r\n couldn&#39;t \nstop crying and was hysterical, especially when she saw I was \nd=\r\nevastated too. I thought that I had finally gotten my answers and \nshe was =\r\njust the best actress I had ever known, end of story. She \ntried to kill he=\r\nrself a couple of times while this was going on a \ncouple months back. If i=\r\nt was as an act or not, I really just don&#39;t \nknow. But when she left last s=\r\nhe left a note telling me not to let \nher die and she hopes that I find her=\r\n soon before her heart stopped. \nMe=85..I said more BS and threw the note i=\r\nn the garbage. \n\nA couple of day&#39;s later curiosity got the best of me and I=\r\n started \nlistening to the rest of the recording. I then started to hear wh=\r\nat \nsounded like people monitoring ME and calling me a &quot;Threat&quot;. I \nimmedia=\r\ntely start acting alarmed. Then in the recording I hear B exit \nthe apartme=\r\nnt in disgust after I stormed off that night, as we were \nfighting about so=\r\nmething weird yet again. After I had left she \nstarted talking about settin=\r\ng up a &quot;Private Meeting&quot; with some other \npeople and something about boatin=\r\ng. Well during the beginning of this \nmeeting I heard a reference to a craz=\r\ny accusation that I had made at \nB awhile ago, which to me at the time conf=\r\nirmed she was in the Mafia. \nThat explained all the weirdness to me and dur=\r\ning this meeting the \nvoices changed a bunch as if they sounded &quot;Masked&quot; or=\r\n &quot;Disguised&quot;, so \nI really had to amp up the volume. \n\nThe next day and eve=\r\nry day after from this point on I amped up the \nvolume in the recording. I =\r\nalso had to distinguish the masked voice \nby breaking the large file into s=\r\nmaller segments of two to four \nsecond intervals, in order to piece the ent=\r\nire recordings meaning \ntogether. Over time I started to interpret the mask=\r\ned voices better \nbecause I thought I was tuning my ears better to them. Th=\r\ne voices in \nthese recordings were two different males, B and some other fe=\r\nmale. I \nlater on saw in the recording that they had actually seen the \nrec=\r\nording but weren&#39;t taking it, which was EXTREMELY odd to me \nconsidering th=\r\ney had been caught. Why not destroy the evidence? \n\nThen I heard one of the=\r\n males say that he was the &quot;Boss of the \nSouthwest Mafia&quot; and that I was go=\r\ning to pay for hurting B like this. \nHe also said that my being a nuisance =\r\nin the apartment had messed up \nhis business within the area and all my spy=\r\n stuff had really pissed \nhim off. He told me I was dead, my daughter along=\r\n with me and more \nthan likely my whole family as well. \n\nHe knew where my =\r\nmom and dad lived and some information I didn&#39;t even \ntell B. I freak out a=\r\nnd figure the damn mob is after me. I keep \nlistening and he says &quot;If I don=\r\n&#39;t move away and discontinue my \ninteractions with my daughter by December =\r\n5th, that he would know \nthat I was just playing with B and then my whole f=\r\namily is dead&quot;. \nThis was exactly one month from when I had used the record=\r\ning device \ntoo by the way. I moved out and away from my daughter breaking =\r\nthe \ntie and in tears the whole time too because I couldnt explain why. I \n=\r\nreally did it because I feared for their lives of my family and felt \nthat =\r\nwe would all die if f I didnt. \n\nMeanwhile B and met someone else that ill =\r\nname J for now. After \nknowing him for two days she decided to bring him ba=\r\nck with her to \npick up her things out of the apartment. I was kicking her =\r\nout of it \nby the way. I thought it was just to piss me off and I forgot ab=\r\nout \nit. Then I heard as I progressed in the recording J&#39;s name brought \nup=\r\n. Supposedly they knew him and he was in their mob and I needed to \ngo atta=\r\nck him to prove myself, or else B will never be seen from me \nagain. I also=\r\n hear that I can&#39;t go to certain places at certain times \nwhere B might be =\r\nand furthermore think that they didnt take the \nrecorder because the damn t=\r\nhing has to be planned down to the times I \nwould hear it. \n\nAt this time I=\r\n am in fear for my life and my families, lost my love \nand I am not underst=\r\nanding how the recording is so damn well time \nplanned, figured im going cr=\r\nazy. Then something ill never forget \nhappens. I am spoken directly too and=\r\n I figure its me going of the \ndeep end now. I try and test my sanity and g=\r\no to different parts of \nthe recording only to get the same thing kind of d=\r\nirect question. I \nam in disarray at this point! I stand up and walk around=\r\n, trying to \nfigure out just what the hell is going on with me. I get back =\r\non and \nfurther see that my verbal questions are now being answered instant=\r\nly \nby this recording (Which is merely a sound file on the pc). *I was \nusi=\r\nng Sound Forge by the way if anyone wanted to know what sound \nsoftware I w=\r\nas using was*.\n\nI have so little sleep at this point and I am told that I n=\r\need to do \nall this crazy stuff and drive out to the middle of some hotel r=\r\night \nthen and there, to further see them, as I have passed all their tests=\r\n \nto get into their mafia now. As a reward B would be there waiting for \nme=\r\n too. I hurry to do it and rush there but no one is even their to \nanswer t=\r\nhe door. I go back and get a yelling voice at me that I had \nleft to early =\r\nand immediatly go back. Me not wanting to piss the mob \nboss anymore, I tak=\r\ne the 45 minute trip again and go back. But when I \nget there it just didn&#39;=\r\nt feel right to me and I never exited the car, \nespecially when I saw the n=\r\numbers in vehicles hadnt changed in the \nparking lot. I had plenty reason t=\r\no be paranoid at this point and \ntruly felt in danger.I left and thought I =\r\nwas done for when I got \nback. Instead, he tells me that he was impressed b=\r\ny my decision when \nand literally puts me in tears when he said that becaus=\r\ne of my \nintelligence, I had won my families lives back, but not my own yet=\r\n. \n\nAll this is done by him also telling me that he can physically see me \n=\r\nthrough his advanced mafia technology on the computer monitor. He \nalso tel=\r\nls me to to move things around on my compter desk that were \nbetween the si=\r\nght of me and the computer monitor, while demanding I \ncorrect my posture w=\r\nhen speaking to him. He also states that he is \nwatching my every move and =\r\nif I tell anyone anything they die along \nwith me. \n\nI make no sense of thi=\r\ns and I was completely baffled on how I was \nbeing communicated with. I had=\r\n just moved and there was no internet \nconnection even. Me just being happy=\r\n my family is safe, I decide to \ngo to sleep. Feeling as though I am now sl=\r\neep deprived and going \ncrazy from the stress, I go to sleep for two days c=\r\nonsistently, as \nthis was during the Thanksgiving holiday time. I would pur=\r\nposely make \nmyself sleep longer when I woke to ensure I didn&#39;t belong in t=\r\nhe \nloony bin. \n\nWhen I finally woke up I was determined to find an explana=\r\ntion to how \nthey were talking to me, I go to the library and look into Blu=\r\netooth \ntechnology, telephony, and remoting into a computer=85..anything. T=\r\nhen \nI realize=85=85..that I can find out just how crazy I really am by mov=\r\ning \nthe recording and listening to it elsewhere. I then decide to take \nth=\r\ne same recording into my work to test my saneness, along with the \nfile its=\r\nelf. If its was on my home CPU=85.then it&#39;s going to now be at \nmy work one=\r\n too right? I do and get the same damn thing, not to \nmention that the &quot;Mob=\r\n Boss&quot; now has company two others when I speak \nto him. All of them yelling=\r\n at me for moving their sensive \ninformation. \n\nDuring this time I invest i=\r\nn GPS, GSM, 3G and several signal blocking \ndevices, in order to prohibit m=\r\nyself from being tracked any further. \nThey never worked or even phased the=\r\n &quot;Mob Boss&quot;. But I would still \ncheck the recording in the evening just to =\r\nhear what I needed to do \nin order to be making them happy and get the poss=\r\nibility to see B \nagain. The &quot;Mob Boss&quot; had told me that it was all just a =\r\ntest for me \nto see if I loved her and she never really did do anything. Th=\r\ney \ncontinue to tell me over and over that I have to beat up J in order \nto=\r\n prove myself to B. That this is what everyone is really waiting on \nand if=\r\n I would just go up to the other town and get it over with, \nthen I can bri=\r\nng her back with me. I won&#39;t do it and say that I won&#39;t \nfight for anything=\r\n that doesn&#39;t want to be fought for. Basically \nsaying that B can call me a=\r\nbout it if she really wants it. Then as a \nresult they start threatening my=\r\n family again. At this point, I \nreally can&#39;t even express to you how much =\r\nof a wreck I am. But I felt \nlike I needed to be strong for my family and g=\r\net on the mob&#39;s good \nside so I can fix the mess I created.\n\nWell it never =\r\nreally happened and this torment went on for a good \nweek, while I was movi=\r\nng everything I could as fast as I could in \norder to make their deadline a=\r\nnd save everyone. Everyday I would do \nwhat I thought was expected of me an=\r\nd hope it wouldnt make them mad \nin one breath, while in the other breath w=\r\nin back my complete \nfreedom, away from their bad side. No matter where I w=\r\nas or what I \ndid during the day they usually seemed to know about it when =\r\nI talked \nto them in the evening. It really bothered me that I couldnt find=\r\n out \nwhere they were putting the &quot;bugs&quot;, or even better how they were \ndoi=\r\nng all of it. My inability to &quot;believe&quot; in the paranormal really \nhurt me h=\r\nere.\n\nSince the apartment that B and I had used was empty at this time and =\r\n\na friend of mine was down on his luck, I gave him the apartment for \nfree =\r\nuntil the lease was completely up. After about a week of me \ndoing this, I =\r\nwalked in and found guns and ammo everywhere and \nfreaked the hell out. Tha=\r\nt&#39;s the last thing I needed when I thought \nthe mob was just down the stree=\r\nt! I made everyone there except my \nfriend leave, with quite a fuss I might=\r\n add. Then I headed back to my \nhome to see how the mob felt about what I d=\r\nid, assure they would be \nimpressed that I had looked out for them. Instead=\r\n the regular female \nthat was always with the &quot;Mob Boss&quot; now asked me why I=\r\n didn&#39;t finish \nthe job, stating that there was still someone there and it =\r\nmade them \nall angry. They demanded that I go back especially to see just h=\r\now &quot;I \nfinished it&quot;. \n\nSo like the puppet I was at that time, I went back. =\r\nI didn&#39;t have the \nheart to put him on the street, even though he had put m=\r\ne at a major \nrisk and instead I just found another place for him to stay. =\r\nOn the \nway there I bought him some water and some smokes. When we got ther=\r\ne \nI even helped him move in and explained that it wasn&#39;t me that did \nit, =\r\nbut the leasing office had saw all the guns. As a result they had \nmade me =\r\ndo it. I thought he made a poor decision and I knew he saw \nthe same, not t=\r\no mention I kind of felt bad that I had to do all of \nthis to him at 11:30P=\r\nM. I truly didnt want to make his life a \ncomplete hell any more than it al=\r\nready was and he felt better that I \nhad talked to him, so as a result I di=\r\nd as well. I then left and once \nagain headed back home. \n\nCertain that I w=\r\nas going to get good praises; I sat at the PC again \nonly to immediately ge=\r\nt yelled at. They asked me why I was &quot;so good&quot; \nand that they had absolutel=\r\ny no respect for me. I tell them I just \ndid all of that for them and they =\r\nsay that I always do things &quot;the \nright way&quot; and they hate me for it. This =\r\nis where I think I hit the \nloony bin and just didnt see how I was going to=\r\n fix this problem. \nThen it got worse and saw that my thoughts were now bei=\r\nng \ncommunicated back to me. Then I knew it and was convinced I was going \n=\r\nskitzo and that i was just truly arguing with myself in reality, \nespeciall=\r\ny when I saw I wasn&#39;t even speaking. I used the restroom, \nsplash water on =\r\nmy face and faintly start to hear the same mob people \nin my fan motor in t=\r\nhe bathroom. I haven&#39;t drank, done any drugs \n(even prescription) and have =\r\na pretty complex job which I can still \nhandle, but yet I feel like I am go=\r\ning crazy. \n\nI can&#39;t talk to anyone about it so I sit back at the CPU, only=\r\n to \nhear that I need to open up the front door. Screw that!=85I just look =\r\n\nout the window and see nothing and say no way. They ask why not and \nthat =\r\nI should trust them and I say hell no and I continue to \nhear &quot;God Damnit&quot; =\r\nfrom them when they get mad. They continue to ask \nme to open the door and =\r\nI continue to check the window to see \nnothing. I say to knock then and the=\r\ny get mad and say they have no \nhands. They don&#39;t sound like they are jokin=\r\ng and get mad when I laugh \neven, so I continue to think I am just crazy at=\r\n this point. I asked \nwhy they wanted to come in and they said they wanted =\r\nto fix me. I say \nthere is nothing wrong with me and they say they hate me =\r\nand want to \neat me.\n\nI start to really think about this and say ill open t=\r\nhe door if I get \nthe answers to all this. They start saying things and its=\r\n if as \nthough they see my thought process develop and say things like=85&quot;w=\r\natch \nhim go&quot;. Then I hear out of my computer monitor something I couldnt \n=\r\neven fathom. I hear my ex-wife&#39;s ex-best friends voice. His name was \nDanie=\r\nl and he had committed suicide over 5 years ago. I did know him, \nbut not a=\r\ns well as she had. It WAS his voice and he said &quot;Charles its \nDaniel&quot; and t=\r\nhen I heard their voice again say we are &quot;down here with \nhim&quot;. At this poi=\r\nnt I didnt know really what to think, but this part \nin our conversation wa=\r\ns the turning point on my beliefs and thoughts \non what was really going on=\r\n. \n\nI say nothing yet they somehow can seem to hear my thoughts and start \n=\r\nsaying little things to make me think even more. It was the most \nfluent co=\r\nnversation I had ever had. It was truly telepathic and was \non a level I co=\r\nuld never really explain even to myself. Then it \nreally hit me and I said =\r\n&quot;Demons&quot;. I tried to play something and got \nno response for the first time=\r\n ever on the sound file. I then started \npiecing it all together from there=\r\n and even though I wasn&#39;t a \nbeliever this makes more sense then I could ev=\r\ner write down here and \nas a result I forever will be one now. \n\nThey ask f=\r\nor me to now open the door and I open the small glass door \non my CPU desk =\r\nand they get really pissed off, saying I tricked them. \nThen their voice ch=\r\nanged to the most demonic, vile and disturbing \nvoice I could ever put into=\r\n words. I never really thought of doing \nthat until that moment and I think=\r\n it was seen from them reaction, \nbut it worked out quite nicely. I start s=\r\naying the our father prayer \nand I can hear the displeasure in them even mo=\r\nre and heard &quot;that&#39;s it \nwe are going in&quot;. I immediately took off my headph=\r\nones and ran to get \na bible they never did as far as I can tell, but I sat=\r\n there all \nnight with the bible in my hand praying. \n\nI started calling pe=\r\nople and my phone started cutting out, the bulb \non the porch blew and my g=\r\nood friend&#39;s girlfriend called me to ask me \nfor help because my friend was=\r\n drunk and passed out. It sounded like \nshe was trying to flirt with me and=\r\n I asked her how &quot;A&quot; nightclub was \nand she said good and then I said didn&#39;=\r\nt you actually go to &quot;B&quot; \nnightclub actually and she switches her story. I =\r\nhang up and call \nback with no answer. The time was only 1:10am and they ne=\r\nver leave \nuntil the clubs close so this was even odder. \n\nI sat there terr=\r\nified most of the night praying, until I called my \nbrother who told me tha=\r\nt I have to stand up to them or I am feeding \ninto their fear. He like my m=\r\nom has been involved in similar things \nlike this but after talking to both=\r\n of them, neither have on this \nlevel. But in a refreshing breath after tal=\r\nking to them about this, \nthey did seem to believe me. But it wasnt unil I =\r\nresearched this \nissue and found out about EVP and how it works, did I trul=\r\ny know that \nI wasnt becoming a lunatic.\n\nThat brings me to today and me be=\r\ning at my wits end. I swear on \neverything this is all 100% true and I feel=\r\n like I am crazy even \nstill. Even though I hear it from no one else and ha=\r\nve a pretty good \ncircle of friends, not to mention that I still seem to do=\r\n my job just \nfine as well. I havent put on my headphones or heard any voic=\r\nes since \nI tried to last listen to the recording, which was now 3 days ago=\r\n. \nDoes anyone have any help and guidance here, as this all has really \ndes=\r\ntroyed my life. I deleted all the copies of the recording, except \nfor one =\r\nhardcopy. I still have the original recorder with the file \non, but I haven=\r\n&#39;t tried to use the recording or recorder any further, \nas I refuse to cont=\r\ninue it without any guidance. I figure its best to \navoid them, like my bro=\r\nther said. Maybe someone can help me \nunderstand all of this. Even if I hav=\r\ne gotten rid of these things \nwhat does that say of B? I really spent a bun=\r\nch of time making this \nreally need some genuine help from someone in the k=\r\nnow. I know it \nsounds crazy but please regard this all as true. I am new t=\r\no this \nstuff and will just stay away from it now, but some kind of insight=\r\n \nwould be great.\n\n \n\n\n      \r\n--0-14616343-1228416759=:75045\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;=\r\nfont-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Hi Chuck!

So its not=\r\n too crazy to believe what has happened to you.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;While reading your story the overwhelming theme was fear. You were consta=\r\nntly afraid of what would happen if you did this or that. If you followed t=\r\nheir instructions by opening the door or anything else they did. It was all=\r\n engineered to instill and create fear in you! You are too afraid! Normally=\r\n if you were just dabbling with this stuff I would say leave it alone becau=\r\nse your not ready. Since you seem to have had it thrust upon you I will sha=\r\nre some information with you.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Very near our ow=\r\nn physical plane is a very dark plane where the barely&nbsp;conscious, mate=\r\nrialistic and flesh obsessed spirits exist and dwell. Some are completely b=\r\nenign and others entertain themselves with the misery of others. There are =\r\nalso those who constantly ask for your help. The meaner of the ones I menti=\r\noned will cuss and pick, lie to you and threaten but besides maybe some min=\r\nor physical (haunting) activity they are really physically harmless. On a p=\r\nsychological level they can be very damaging if you are not prepared for th=\r\neir antics. One of the things you need to know about this dark ring around =\r\nour physical world is that it is monitored by controllers or gatekeepers. T=\r\nhey allow only certain things to pass from level to level. Most of the spir=\r\nits of this area are aware of their presence and some are not. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;If you hear from these spirits again deal with them as yo=\r\nu would with any person giving you problems. Tell them with authority you w=\r\nant to speak with the gatekeeper. It is a term they know, I have heard them=\r\n use it. If the gatekeeper comes on and you trust it to be one then request=\r\n that the former channel be closed and request a new (higher) channel of co=\r\nmmunication.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Remember, like attracts like and =\r\nfear generates hate. Do not be afraid of these things, they are around you =\r\nwhether you hear them or not. If you want more information please email me =\r\nprivately.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Regards,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Frank R.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, =\r\ntimes, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; MARGIN=\r\n: 5px 0px 5px 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid; FONT-FAMILY: times new r=\r\noman, new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTahoma size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nB&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; chuck255 &lt;chuck255@=\r\nyahoo.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; EVP-IT=\r\nC@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; =\r\nWednesday, December 3, 2008 1:46:27 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bo=\r\nld&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [EVP-ITC] Any insight on my life changing EVP exper=\r\nience?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;My name is Chuck and I stumbl=\r\ned upon this site and its information &lt;BR&gt;while trying to figure out what&#39;s=\r\n going on in my crazy life. Before I &lt;BR&gt;get into that let me explain a bit=\r\n about myself. I am a male in his &lt;BR&gt;30&#39;s, who has Bachelors in Regional D=\r\nevelopment, with a minor in &lt;BR&gt;Computer Science. I work at a respective po=\r\nwer plant company within &lt;BR&gt;Arizona doing GIS Tech Work. I get drug tested=\r\n at it on random &lt;BR&gt;occasion and I really only drink socially, or on some =\r\nholiday &lt;BR&gt;occasions. I have always been a logical kind of thinker my whol=\r\ne life &lt;BR&gt;and never really had any &quot;belief&quot; in the paranormal, even though=\r\n my &lt;BR&gt;mom and brother strongly do. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I feel so weird even trying to=\r\n explain this story because about a &lt;BR&gt;week ago I would have thought of it=\r\n as silly. About a year ago I met &lt;BR&gt;someone else, who for now ill call B.=\r\n I fell madly in love with her &lt;BR&gt;and after a short time I was more than h=\r\nappy to have her come and &lt;BR&gt;live\n with me at my new place. In some strang=\r\ne way I always felt as if &lt;BR&gt;there was something about B I could never qui=\r\nte understand. After &lt;BR&gt;about 3-4 months of living with her I started to g=\r\net the inclination &lt;BR&gt;that B was cheating on me. Her stories never added u=\r\np, her job was &lt;BR&gt;secretive and she started stumbling on her words a lot. =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I then started getting spy gadgets, because she was staying with me=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;and I was concerned about my place along with her activities there. I =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;at first just got a digital recorder, but then after time I started &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;to get aggravated and felt that the digital recordings were just &lt;BR&gt;being=\r\n used to play and taunt me. So then I went to the extent of &lt;BR&gt;getting Cam=\r\neras and even Camcorders. Whenever I would ask about &lt;BR&gt;something peculiar=\r\n, I got tears and a really heartfelt reaction that &lt;BR&gt;really made me belie=\r\nve her. I felt like we really loved one another &lt;BR&gt;and I could really see =\r\nsome care in her eyes, so\n most of the time I &lt;BR&gt;just gave in to what she =\r\nsaid as true, but didnt have enough to stop &lt;BR&gt;looking. I felt like I had =\r\nbeen in enough relationships to know the &lt;BR&gt;difference here. I have seen t=\r\nhe act before and it really didn&#39;t look &lt;BR&gt;that way here, unless she was j=\r\nust really that good at fooling &lt;BR&gt;people. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;During the course of ou=\r\nr stay there she would pitch a huge fit if I &lt;BR&gt;had to leave her at the ap=\r\nartment alone and would stop at nothing to &lt;BR&gt;try and be in my company ins=\r\ntead. But I started to get aggravated as &lt;BR&gt;time progressed and knew somet=\r\nhing was up, because of the odd voices &lt;BR&gt;I would hear within the recordin=\r\ngs. I made her stay there will trying &lt;BR&gt;to sneak back and see who was mes=\r\nsing with her around my place. I &lt;BR&gt;lost it because I couldn&#39;t pinpoint it=\r\n at all and last July and got &lt;BR&gt;into a fight right outside of my place wi=\r\nth three other people. She &lt;BR&gt;always told me she talked to her self when I=\r\n qestioned other\n voices &lt;BR&gt;and I never could see anyone else there when s=\r\nhe did, even with the &lt;BR&gt;cameras, so I had no choice but to continue on be=\r\nlieveing her still=85=85&lt;BR&gt;even though my feelings wouldn&#39;t agree to her w=\r\nords. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For some odd reason it just seemed as if she knew where the c=\r\nameras &lt;BR&gt;and recorders were every time, just by the way she would exit an=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;enter the apartment. So then I started putting them outside and about=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;a month ago something crazy happened. I started listening to a &lt;BR&gt;dig=\r\nital recording and at the beginning of it I flat out heard B &lt;BR&gt;cheating o=\r\nn me with someone. I was upset and happy at the same time &lt;BR&gt;that I finall=\r\ny had caught it and as a result I sent her away. She &lt;BR&gt;left town because =\r\nall her family was in another city. She couldn&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;stop crying and was hy=\r\nsterical, especially when she saw I was &lt;BR&gt;devastated too. I thought that =\r\nI had finally gotten my answers and &lt;BR&gt;she was just the best actress I had=\r\n ever\n known, end of story. She &lt;BR&gt;tried to kill herself a couple of times=\r\n while this was going on a &lt;BR&gt;couple months back. If it was as an act or n=\r\not, I really just don&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;know. But when she left last she left a note te=\r\nlling me not to let &lt;BR&gt;her die and she hopes that I find her soon before h=\r\ner heart stopped. &lt;BR&gt;Me=85..I said more BS and threw the note in the garba=\r\nge. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A couple of day&#39;s later curiosity got the best of me and I star=\r\nted &lt;BR&gt;listening to the rest of the recording. I then started to hear what=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;sounded like people monitoring ME and calling me a &quot;Threat&quot;. I &lt;BR&gt;imm=\r\nediately start acting alarmed. Then in the recording I hear B exit &lt;BR&gt;the =\r\napartment in disgust after I stormed off that night, as we were &lt;BR&gt;fightin=\r\ng about something weird yet again. After I had left she &lt;BR&gt;started talking=\r\n about setting up a &quot;Private Meeting&quot; with some other &lt;BR&gt;people and someth=\r\ning about boating. Well during the beginning of this &lt;BR&gt;meeting I heard a\n=\r\n reference to a crazy accusation that I had made at &lt;BR&gt;B awhile ago, which=\r\n to me at the time confirmed she was in the Mafia. &lt;BR&gt;That explained all t=\r\nhe weirdness to me and during this meeting the &lt;BR&gt;voices changed a bunch a=\r\ns if they sounded &quot;Masked&quot; or &quot;Disguised&quot;, so &lt;BR&gt;I really had to amp up th=\r\ne volume. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The next day and every day after from this point on I amp=\r\ned up the &lt;BR&gt;volume in the recording. I also had to distinguish the masked=\r\n voice &lt;BR&gt;by breaking the large file into smaller segments of two to four =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;second intervals, in order to piece the entire recordings meaning &lt;BR&gt;t=\r\nogether. Over time I started to interpret the masked voices better &lt;BR&gt;beca=\r\nuse I thought I was tuning my ears better to them. The voices in &lt;BR&gt;these =\r\nrecordings were two different males, B and some other female. I &lt;BR&gt;later o=\r\nn saw in the recording that they had actually seen the &lt;BR&gt;recording but we=\r\nren&#39;t taking it, which was EXTREMELY odd to me &lt;BR&gt;considering they\n had be=\r\nen caught. Why not destroy the evidence? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then I heard one of the ma=\r\nles say that he was the &quot;Boss of the &lt;BR&gt;Southwest Mafia&quot; and that I was go=\r\ning to pay for hurting B like this. &lt;BR&gt;He also said that my being a nuisan=\r\nce in the apartment had messed up &lt;BR&gt;his business within the area and all =\r\nmy spy stuff had really pissed &lt;BR&gt;him off. He told me I was dead, my daugh=\r\nter along with me and more &lt;BR&gt;than likely my whole family as well. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;He knew where my mom and dad lived and some information I didn&#39;t even &lt;BR&gt;=\r\ntell B. I freak out and figure the damn mob is after me. I keep &lt;BR&gt;listeni=\r\nng and he says &quot;If I don&#39;t move away and discontinue my &lt;BR&gt;interactions wi=\r\nth my daughter by December 5th, that he would know &lt;BR&gt;that I was just play=\r\ning with B and then my whole family is dead&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;This was exactly one mont=\r\nh from when I had used the recording device &lt;BR&gt;too by the way. I moved out=\r\n and away from my daughter breaking the &lt;BR&gt;tie and in tears\n the whole tim=\r\ne too because I couldnt explain why. I &lt;BR&gt;really did it because I feared f=\r\nor their lives of my family and felt &lt;BR&gt;that we would all die if f I didnt=\r\n. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Meanwhile B and met someone else that ill name J for now. After &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;knowing him for two days she decided to bring him back with her to &lt;BR&gt;p=\r\nick up her things out of the apartment. I was kicking her out of it &lt;BR&gt;by =\r\nthe way. I thought it was just to piss me off and I forgot about &lt;BR&gt;it. Th=\r\nen I heard as I progressed in the recording J&#39;s name brought &lt;BR&gt;up. Suppos=\r\nedly they knew him and he was in their mob and I needed to &lt;BR&gt;go attack hi=\r\nm to prove myself, or else B will never be seen from me &lt;BR&gt;again. I also h=\r\near that I can&#39;t go to certain places at certain times &lt;BR&gt;where B might be=\r\n and furthermore think that they didnt take the &lt;BR&gt;recorder because the da=\r\nmn thing has to be planned down to the times I &lt;BR&gt;would hear it. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A=\r\nt this time I am in fear for my life and my families,\n lost my love &lt;BR&gt;and=\r\n I am not understanding how the recording is so damn well time &lt;BR&gt;planned,=\r\n figured im going crazy. Then something ill never forget &lt;BR&gt;happens. I am =\r\nspoken directly too and I figure its me going of the &lt;BR&gt;deep end now. I tr=\r\ny and test my sanity and go to different parts of &lt;BR&gt;the recording only to=\r\n get the same thing kind of direct question. I &lt;BR&gt;am in disarray at this p=\r\noint! I stand up and walk around, trying to &lt;BR&gt;figure out just what the he=\r\nll is going on with me. I get back on and &lt;BR&gt;further see that my verbal qu=\r\nestions are now being answered instantly &lt;BR&gt;by this recording (Which is me=\r\nrely a sound file on the pc). *I was &lt;BR&gt;using Sound Forge by the way if an=\r\nyone wanted to know what sound &lt;BR&gt;software I was using was*.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have=\r\n so little sleep at this point and I am told that I need to do &lt;BR&gt;all this=\r\n crazy stuff and drive out to the middle of some hotel right &lt;BR&gt;then and t=\r\nhere, to further see them, as I have passed all\n their tests &lt;BR&gt;to get int=\r\no their mafia now. As a reward B would be there waiting for &lt;BR&gt;me too. I h=\r\nurry to do it and rush there but no one is even their to &lt;BR&gt;answer the doo=\r\nr. I go back and get a yelling voice at me that I had &lt;BR&gt;left to early and=\r\n immediatly go back. Me not wanting to piss the mob &lt;BR&gt;boss anymore, I tak=\r\ne the 45 minute trip again and go back. But when I &lt;BR&gt;get there it just di=\r\ndn&#39;t feel right to me and I never exited the car, &lt;BR&gt;especially when I saw=\r\n the numbers in vehicles hadnt changed in the &lt;BR&gt;parking lot. I had plenty=\r\n reason to be paranoid at this point and &lt;BR&gt;truly felt in danger.I left an=\r\nd thought I was done for when I got &lt;BR&gt;back. Instead, he tells me that he =\r\nwas impressed by my decision when &lt;BR&gt;and literally puts me in tears when h=\r\ne said that because of my &lt;BR&gt;intelligence, I had won my families lives bac=\r\nk, but not my own yet. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All this is done by him also telling me that=\r\n he can physically see me &lt;BR&gt;through his\n advanced mafia technology on the=\r\n computer monitor. He &lt;BR&gt;also tells me to to move things around on my comp=\r\nter desk that were &lt;BR&gt;between the sight of me and the computer monitor, wh=\r\nile demanding I &lt;BR&gt;correct my posture when speaking to him. He also states=\r\n that he is &lt;BR&gt;watching my every move and if I tell anyone anything they d=\r\nie along &lt;BR&gt;with me. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I make no sense of this and I was completely =\r\nbaffled on how I was &lt;BR&gt;being communicated with. I had just moved and ther=\r\ne was no internet &lt;BR&gt;connection even. Me just being happy my family is saf=\r\ne, I decide to &lt;BR&gt;go to sleep. Feeling as though I am now sleep deprived a=\r\nnd going &lt;BR&gt;crazy from the stress, I go to sleep for two days consistently=\r\n, as &lt;BR&gt;this was during the Thanksgiving holiday time. I would purposely m=\r\nake &lt;BR&gt;myself sleep longer when I woke to ensure I didn&#39;t belong in the &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;loony bin. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I finally woke up I was determined to find an exp=\r\nlanation to how &lt;BR&gt;they were\n talking to me, I go to the library and look =\r\ninto Bluetooth &lt;BR&gt;technology, telephony, and remoting into a computer=85..=\r\nanything. Then &lt;BR&gt;I realize=85=85..that I can find out just how crazy I re=\r\nally am by moving &lt;BR&gt;the recording and listening to it elsewhere. I then d=\r\necide to take &lt;BR&gt;the same recording into my work to test my saneness, alon=\r\ng with the &lt;BR&gt;file itself. If its was on my home CPU=85.then it&#39;s going to=\r\n now be at &lt;BR&gt;my work one too right? I do and get the same damn thing, not=\r\n to &lt;BR&gt;mention that the &quot;Mob Boss&quot; now has company two others when I speak=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;to him. All of them yelling at me for moving their sensive &lt;BR&gt;informa=\r\ntion. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;During this time I invest in GPS, GSM, 3G and several signal =\r\nblocking &lt;BR&gt;devices, in order to prohibit myself from being tracked any fu=\r\nrther. &lt;BR&gt;They never worked or even phased the &quot;Mob Boss&quot;. But I would sti=\r\nll &lt;BR&gt;check the recording in the evening just to hear what I needed to do =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;in order to be\n making them happy and get the possibility to see B &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nagain. The &quot;Mob Boss&quot; had told me that it was all just a test for me &lt;BR&gt;to=\r\n see if I loved her and she never really did do anything. They &lt;BR&gt;continue=\r\n to tell me over and over that I have to beat up J in order &lt;BR&gt;to prove my=\r\nself to B. That this is what everyone is really waiting on &lt;BR&gt;and if I wou=\r\nld just go up to the other town and get it over with, &lt;BR&gt;then I can bring =\r\nher back with me. I won&#39;t do it and say that I won&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;fight for anything=\r\n that doesn&#39;t want to be fought for. Basically &lt;BR&gt;saying that B can call m=\r\ne about it if she really wants it. Then as a &lt;BR&gt;result they start threaten=\r\ning my family again. At this point, I &lt;BR&gt;really can&#39;t even express to you =\r\nhow much of a wreck I am. But I felt &lt;BR&gt;like I needed to be strong for my =\r\nfamily and get on the mob&#39;s good &lt;BR&gt;side so I can fix the mess I created.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well it never really happened and this torment went on for a good &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;week,\n while I was moving everything I could as fast as I could in &lt;BR&gt;or=\r\nder to make their deadline and save everyone. Everyday I would do &lt;BR&gt;what =\r\nI thought was expected of me and hope it wouldnt make them mad &lt;BR&gt;in one b=\r\nreath, while in the other breath win back my complete &lt;BR&gt;freedom, away fro=\r\nm their bad side. No matter where I was or what I &lt;BR&gt;did during the day th=\r\ney usually seemed to know about it when I talked &lt;BR&gt;to them in the evening=\r\n. It really bothered me that I couldnt find out &lt;BR&gt;where they were putting=\r\n the &quot;bugs&quot;, or even better how they were &lt;BR&gt;doing all of it. My inability=\r\n to &quot;believe&quot; in the paranormal really &lt;BR&gt;hurt me here.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Since the a=\r\npartment that B and I had used was empty at this time and &lt;BR&gt;a friend of m=\r\nine was down on his luck, I gave him the apartment for &lt;BR&gt;free until the l=\r\nease was completely up. After about a week of me &lt;BR&gt;doing this, I walked i=\r\nn and found guns and ammo everywhere and &lt;BR&gt;freaked the hell out. That&#39;s\n =\r\nthe last thing I needed when I thought &lt;BR&gt;the mob was just down the street=\r\n! I made everyone there except my &lt;BR&gt;friend leave, with quite a fuss I mig=\r\nht add. Then I headed back to my &lt;BR&gt;home to see how the mob felt about wha=\r\nt I did, assure they would be &lt;BR&gt;impressed that I had looked out for them.=\r\n Instead the regular female &lt;BR&gt;that was always with the &quot;Mob Boss&quot; now ask=\r\ned me why I didn&#39;t finish &lt;BR&gt;the job, stating that there was still someone=\r\n there and it made them &lt;BR&gt;all angry. They demanded that I go back especia=\r\nlly to see just how &quot;I &lt;BR&gt;finished it&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So like the puppet I was a=\r\nt that time, I went back. I didn&#39;t have the &lt;BR&gt;heart to put him on the str=\r\neet, even though he had put me at a major &lt;BR&gt;risk and instead I just found=\r\n another place for him to stay. On the &lt;BR&gt;way there I bought him some wate=\r\nr and some smokes. When we got there &lt;BR&gt;I even helped him move in and expl=\r\nained that it wasn&#39;t me that did &lt;BR&gt;it, but the leasing office had\n saw al=\r\nl the guns. As a result they had &lt;BR&gt;made me do it. I thought he made a poo=\r\nr decision and I knew he saw &lt;BR&gt;the same, not to mention I kind of felt ba=\r\nd that I had to do all of &lt;BR&gt;this to him at 11:30PM. I truly didnt want to=\r\n make his life a &lt;BR&gt;complete hell any more than it already was and he felt=\r\n better that I &lt;BR&gt;had talked to him, so as a result I did as well. I then =\r\nleft and once &lt;BR&gt;again headed back home. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Certain that I was going =\r\nto get good praises; I sat at the PC again &lt;BR&gt;only to immediately get yell=\r\ned at. They asked me why I was &quot;so good&quot; &lt;BR&gt;and that they had absolutely n=\r\no respect for me. I tell them I just &lt;BR&gt;did all of that for them and they =\r\nsay that I always do things &quot;the &lt;BR&gt;right way&quot; and they hate me for it. Th=\r\nis is where I think I hit the &lt;BR&gt;loony bin and just didnt see how I was go=\r\ning to fix this problem. &lt;BR&gt;Then it got worse and saw that my thoughts wer=\r\ne now being &lt;BR&gt;communicated back to me. Then I knew it and\n was convinced =\r\nI was going &lt;BR&gt;skitzo and that i was just truly arguing with myself in rea=\r\nlity, &lt;BR&gt;especially when I saw I wasn&#39;t even speaking. I used the restroom=\r\n, &lt;BR&gt;splash water on my face and faintly start to hear the same mob people=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;in my fan motor in the bathroom. I haven&#39;t drank, done any drugs &lt;BR&gt;(=\r\neven prescription) and have a pretty complex job which I can still &lt;BR&gt;hand=\r\nle, but yet I feel like I am going crazy. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I can&#39;t talk to anyone ab=\r\nout it so I sit back at the CPU, only to &lt;BR&gt;hear that I need to open up th=\r\ne front door. Screw that!=85I just look &lt;BR&gt;out the window and see nothing =\r\nand say no way. They ask why not and &lt;BR&gt;that I should trust them and I say=\r\n hell no and I continue to &lt;BR&gt;hear &quot;God Damnit&quot; from them when they get ma=\r\nd. They continue to ask &lt;BR&gt;me to open the door and I continue to check the=\r\n window to see &lt;BR&gt;nothing. I say to knock then and they get mad and say th=\r\ney have no &lt;BR&gt;hands. They don&#39;t sound like they are\n joking and get mad wh=\r\nen I laugh &lt;BR&gt;even, so I continue to think I am just crazy at this point. =\r\nI asked &lt;BR&gt;why they wanted to come in and they said they wanted to fix me.=\r\n I say &lt;BR&gt;there is nothing wrong with me and they say they hate me and wan=\r\nt to &lt;BR&gt;eat me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I start to really think about this and say ill open=\r\n the door if I get &lt;BR&gt;the answers to all this. They start saying things an=\r\nd its if as &lt;BR&gt;though they see my thought process develop and say things l=\r\nike=85&quot;watch &lt;BR&gt;him go&quot;. Then I hear out of my computer monitor something =\r\nI couldnt &lt;BR&gt;even fathom. I hear my ex-wife&#39;s ex-best friends voice. His n=\r\name was &lt;BR&gt;Daniel and he had committed suicide over 5 years ago. I did kno=\r\nw him, &lt;BR&gt;but not as well as she had. It WAS his voice and he said &quot;Charle=\r\ns its &lt;BR&gt;Daniel&quot; and then I heard their voice again say we are &quot;down here =\r\nwith &lt;BR&gt;him&quot;. At this point I didnt know really what to think, but this pa=\r\nrt &lt;BR&gt;in our conversation was the turning\n point on my beliefs and thought=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;on what was really going on. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I say nothing yet they somehow c=\r\nan seem to hear my thoughts and start &lt;BR&gt;saying little things to make me t=\r\nhink even more. It was the most &lt;BR&gt;fluent conversation I had ever had. It =\r\nwas truly telepathic and was &lt;BR&gt;on a level I could never really explain ev=\r\nen to myself. Then it &lt;BR&gt;really hit me and I said &quot;Demons&quot;. I tried to pla=\r\ny something and got &lt;BR&gt;no response for the first time ever on the sound fi=\r\nle. I then started &lt;BR&gt;piecing it all together from there and even though I=\r\n wasn&#39;t a &lt;BR&gt;believer this makes more sense then I could ever write down h=\r\nere and &lt;BR&gt;as a result I forever will be one now. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They ask for me =\r\nto now open the door and I open the small glass door &lt;BR&gt;on my CPU desk and=\r\n they get really pissed off, saying I tricked them. &lt;BR&gt;Then their voice ch=\r\nanged to the most demonic, vile and disturbing &lt;BR&gt;voice I could ever put i=\r\nnto words. I never really thought of\n doing &lt;BR&gt;that until that moment and =\r\nI think it was seen from them reaction, &lt;BR&gt;but it worked out quite nicely.=\r\n I start saying the our father prayer &lt;BR&gt;and I can hear the displeasure in=\r\n them even more and heard &quot;that&#39;s it &lt;BR&gt;we are going in&quot;. I immediately to=\r\nok off my headphones and ran to get &lt;BR&gt;a bible they never did as far as I =\r\ncan tell, but I sat there all &lt;BR&gt;night with the bible in my hand praying. =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I started calling people and my phone started cutting out, the bulb=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;on the porch blew and my good friend&#39;s girlfriend called me to ask me =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;for help because my friend was drunk and passed out. It sounded like &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;she was trying to flirt with me and I asked her how &quot;A&quot; nightclub was &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;and she said good and then I said didn&#39;t you actually go to &quot;B&quot; &lt;BR&gt;nightc=\r\nlub actually and she switches her story. I hang up and call &lt;BR&gt;back with n=\r\no answer. The time was only 1:10am and they never leave &lt;BR&gt;until the clubs=\r\n close so this was even odder.\n &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I sat there terrified most of the n=\r\night praying, until I called my &lt;BR&gt;brother who told me that I have to stan=\r\nd up to them or I am feeding &lt;BR&gt;into their fear. He like my mom has been i=\r\nnvolved in similar things &lt;BR&gt;like this but after talking to both of them, =\r\nneither have on this &lt;BR&gt;level. But in a refreshing breath after talking to=\r\n them about this, &lt;BR&gt;they did seem to believe me. But it wasnt unil I rese=\r\narched this &lt;BR&gt;issue and found out about EVP and how it works, did I truly=\r\n know that &lt;BR&gt;I wasnt becoming a lunatic.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That brings me to today a=\r\nnd me being at my wits end. I swear on &lt;BR&gt;everything this is all 100% true=\r\n and I feel like I am crazy even &lt;BR&gt;still. Even though I hear it from no o=\r\nne else and have a pretty good &lt;BR&gt;circle of friends, not to mention that I=\r\n still seem to do my job just &lt;BR&gt;fine as well. I havent put on my headphon=\r\nes or heard any voices since &lt;BR&gt;I tried to last listen to the recording, w=\r\nhich was now 3 days ago.\n &lt;BR&gt;Does anyone have any help and guidance here, =\r\nas this all has really &lt;BR&gt;destroyed my life. I deleted all the copies of t=\r\nhe recording, except &lt;BR&gt;for one hardcopy. I still have the original record=\r\ner with the file &lt;BR&gt;on, but I haven&#39;t tried to use the recording or record=\r\ner any further, &lt;BR&gt;as I refuse to continue it without any guidance. I figu=\r\nre its best to &lt;BR&gt;avoid them, like my brother said. Maybe someone can help=\r\n me &lt;BR&gt;understand all of this. Even if I have gotten rid of these things &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;what does that say of B? I really spent a bunch of time making this &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nreally need some genuine help from someone in the know. I know it &lt;BR&gt;sound=\r\ns crazy but please regard this all as true. I am new to this &lt;BR&gt;stuff and =\r\nwill just stay away from it now, but some kind of insight &lt;BR&gt;would be grea=\r\nt.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-14616343-1228416759=:75045--"}
