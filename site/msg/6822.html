<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi!  My name is Nellie and I am a new convert to ITC work.  I&#x27;ve been
doing evps for a few years with a fair amount of success.  One of the
things I have been experimenting with is using music.  I play music
from the lifetimes of the spirits I&#x27;m trying to communicate with to
get the spirits intrigued enough to talk more.  I took a quick look at
some of the old messages here, and will definitely have to experiment
with some of the suggestions you all have had about using music as
more of a carrier wave to make it easier for them to speak through.

What drew me to this group, though, is that I just made a Radio Shack
hack a couple of days ago and have been completely stunned by the
results.  I&#x27;m getting more communications through it in 15 minutes
than I would usually get in evps over hours.  I am absolutely blown
away.  Even more interesting is that a spirit in my house who I&#x27;ve
never been able to get evps from is quite the chatterbox through the
hack.  I have a couple of my first files in the folder Nellie&#x27;s Files
that I found particularly interesting.

Anyway, I am looking forward to learning from/with you all.
