But Im thinking that maybe its my mic picking up sounds of me leaning on my desk and even tho it isnt audible to me at the time, my mic is still able to pick it up. hahaha.  Im gonna do an experiment tonight or tomorrow to see if thats the case.  \n   \n  Rhonda\n\nSteve Hultay &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n          Rhonda,\n\nI heard it, but i&#39;ve had a similar sound in one of my recordings \ntoo.
