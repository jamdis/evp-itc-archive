Just \n&gt; &gt; imagine the amount of energy that must be imprinted on\n&gt; that exact \n&gt; &gt; spot.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is where I hoped to gain a better understanding\n&gt; of that energy \n&gt; &gt; which is imprinted... and I must say, I think I have\n&gt; done just that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Today I processed a number of the files I captured\n&gt; from the impact \n&gt; &gt; point using numerous devices of the non-microphone\n&gt; type.  After I put \n&gt; &gt; each of these files through a four step process (which\n&gt; I&#39;ll explain \n&gt; &gt; in great detail in my video), I was able to listen to\n&gt; some amazing, \n&gt; &gt; and very relivent sounds.\n&gt; &gt; My wife was so upset after I told her what I had\n&gt; heard, she refused \n&gt; &gt; to listen to the audio.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me just say... the combination I used was able to\n&gt; capture a very \n&gt; &gt; chilling scene.  One I just have to believe were the\n&gt; last moments of \n&gt; &gt; those who perished.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Once I publish the final results, I hope others will\n&gt; be able to \n&gt; &gt; verify what I am hearing...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m figuring to put a multi-part video on my\n&gt; Youtube page.  One part \n&gt; &gt; explaining what will be seen an heard, as well as\n&gt; describing the \n&gt; &gt; events of that day.  Another part with my sessions at\n&gt; the various \n&gt; &gt; locations, using various methods.  And a final part\n&gt; with the audio of \n&gt; &gt; the researchers who assisted with this experiment\n&gt; using the debris I \n&gt; &gt; sent each of them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bottom line... I really do believe that energy is\n&gt; imprinted in \n&gt; &gt; objects, and at locations where energy was strong at a\n&gt; time of \n&gt; &gt; imprint.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Happy Holidays to all.... have a safe and fun Holiday\n&gt; Season!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike C.

It seems kirlian\n&gt; photography captures certain\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; types of energy on film. In the\n&gt; demonstration a picture of a \n&gt; &gt; house \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shown. Later that same house had a fire and\n&gt; part of the house had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; burned to the ground but the photo taken\n&gt; with kirlian photography\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later showed that part of the house still\n&gt; there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m no expert but maybe energy we\n&gt; can&#39;t see leaves an imprint in \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; non physical universe and can be viewed or\n&gt; demonstrated using the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right instruments and technique. Of course I\n&gt; really have no clue \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; am fascinated by the evp and itc phenomena.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Enjoyed visiting your site, thanks for the\n&gt; link.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Richard\n&gt; &gt;"}
