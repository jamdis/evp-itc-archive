We are all over at RTSC, there is a lot more activity over there.\n\nAre you still a member over there?\n\nAs for an investigation, i am trying to set up a date for the Red Mill Inn.  If you are interested, i&#39;ll add you to the list.  I&#39;m thinking of getting Bruce Tango to hang out with us when we do it.  I told him i would go over using the ghost box with him, i gave him one a year ago.\n\n-Steve\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jelly_eyes&quot; &lt;ppsmeet@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; This is SPIRIT_RADIO, my normally used account is FUBAR so I need to use this one. I have a week off from school and actually have some time to say hey. Still need to read back through the posts to catch up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since Halloween is right around the corner, I&#39;m checking around for an investigation to participate in. Not that Halloween has anything to do with it! Well okay, a little. \n&gt; \n&gt; Steve, Ralph, Tracy, any interest in getting another investigation under way? Is Tanya still kicking around here? \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Mark\n&gt;"}
