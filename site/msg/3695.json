I played it back as I was still  \ndriving. During one part, I told them about the box and what I wanted  \nthem to do once I had it. I said, &quot;Talk to me, guys.&quot; Right afterward  \na male voice said, &quot;Talking.&quot; I was one big smile for an hour.\n\nAnn\n\n\nOn Dec 3, 2007, at 12:19 AM, Lance Oliver wrote:\n\n&gt; Well, I&#39;ve gone ahead and done it...\n&gt;\n&gt; I purchased one of Ron&#39;s MiniBox&#39;s!!\n&gt;\n&gt; No snowball will be safe in hell now!\n&gt;\n&gt; Tell you what, instead of asking Chris about life and death or heaven\n&gt; and hell, I plan to:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1)Take a training class provided freely by ASUP.\n&gt; 2)Engage in a little direct inquiry and testing of spirits.\n&gt; 3)Strongly encourage fearless people to find their own answers, by\n&gt; doing something likewise.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Lance\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;babiarz3&quot; &lt;babiarz3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lance,\n&gt; &gt; I think you make my point very well. You say you don&#39;t know Chris\n&gt; &gt; personally but that it seems I am the one wearing rose colored\n&gt; &gt; glasses. I do know Chris. Even when Frank is upset he says &quot;Chris\n&gt; is a\n&gt; &gt; nice guy&quot;. Chris&#39; statements and beliefs have never changed while\n&gt; &gt; others can be wishy washy depending on the day. The view that Chris\n&gt; &gt; does not want any one to research the box besides him is BS. The\n&gt; fact\n&gt; &gt; is that prior to Franks original yahoo group disappearing, Chris\n&gt; &gt; provided a link directly to the schematics. In his presentations he\n&gt; &gt; would tell people that the schematics were available online. Yet,\n&gt; &gt; because he is against mass production, it MUST be because he wants\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; research all to himself. Rose colored glasses or a case of only\n&gt; seeing\n&gt; &gt; what is wanted? This is a fact compared to perceptions and\n&gt; opinions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fact: Almost each and every user of a box or it&#39;s facsimile have\n&gt; &gt; stated that lower energy/evil/dark... entities have spoken via the\n&gt; &gt; device.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fact: Rick Moran states that the groups for testing will include\n&gt; &gt; believers, skeptics, senior citizens, (now here&#39;s where it gets\n&gt; scary)\n&gt; &gt; CHILDREN and HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Couple the last two facts together and do the math. One mentally\n&gt; &gt; unstable child or youth hears the box tell him it is right to kill\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; rape or .....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fact: Rick Moran in his article about Tools being only as good as\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; users states, &quot;...know how they work before you go into the field.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; So, in one place we are still testing, in another we are sending\n&gt; them\n&gt; &gt; out in the field to be tested by groups that include children and\n&gt; high\n&gt; &gt; school students. The good thing is that a nice little online\n&gt; tutorial\n&gt; &gt; is available with some warnings. Phew! As long as this can&#39;t come\n&gt; back\n&gt; &gt; on anyone I guess all the bases are covered (tongue in cheek).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fact: Chris has been the primary tester of the device in the field.\n&gt; &gt; That fact deserves consideration, at the very least.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fact: Last night, a radio personality on Spooky South Coast claimed\n&gt; &gt; that after he engaged the dark voices coming through the box, he was\n&gt; &gt; physically attacked.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fact: Frank has stated that in the beginning Chris was the only one\n&gt; &gt; who understood how the box should be used.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fact: Some people who have received boxes from Frank discovered they\n&gt; &gt; were not able to use them although they worked fine for Frank. These\n&gt; &gt; same people would not return the boxes to be looked at.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fact: After death communications have been received via both\n&gt; computers\n&gt; &gt; and phones. If it were simply the devices and not the users would we\n&gt; &gt; not have millions of these communications?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fact: Mark Macy states that in an after death communication\n&gt; &gt; communication with Konstanin Raudive in which Mark asks &quot; Can you\n&gt; tell\n&gt; &gt; me about the equipment you use to produce a perfect, almost perfect\n&gt; &gt; voice on earth?&quot; Konstanin replies &quot;Well it depends on your\n&gt; reception-\n&gt; &gt; or mainly your psychic reception.&quot; This fact backs up the theory\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; effective users are limited.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fact: In another after death communication Konstanin addresses\n&gt; contact\n&gt; &gt; fields saying &quot;...but if there is dissonance in the form of fears,\n&gt; &gt; doubts, and animosities the contact field becomes cloudy...that&#39;s\n&gt; when\n&gt; &gt; negative spirit groups close to earth in vibration can break into\n&gt; &gt; existing bridges with troubling results.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And so yes, maybe I wear rose colored glasses. However, I am\n&gt; inclined\n&gt; &gt; to believe that I have done my research and have availed myself of\n&gt; &gt; quite a bit of information regarding this topic.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With that said, I am holding an online event where people can ask\n&gt; &gt; Chris the questions they want as long as they are formed in an\n&gt; &gt; intelligent manner. If you are interested in attending the event you\n&gt; &gt; can find the information on the front page of my site at\n&gt; &gt; www.thepsinetwork.com I felt it unnecessary to attempt to &quot;bridge\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; gap&quot; as well between speculation, insinuation and fact.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; &gt; Babs\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Lance Oliver&quot; &lt;orbhunterx@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Bab,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even though I&#39;ve newly begun to chime in here, it seems to me\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some people are guilty of wearing rose colored glasses, as far as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris is concerned. LOL! I don&#39;t know him personally, so I really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know what really motivates him. Right or wrong, by\n&gt; conducting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself in the manner he has, it&#39;s understandable why his\n&gt; approach\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has drawn the scrutiny from his peers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frankly, this entire effort is a great learning experience and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; potential healing for mankind! I encourage all of us researcher\n&gt; types\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to simply sit back, and take a deep breath or three. Consider\n&gt; &gt; &gt; together why we&#39;re doing this.
