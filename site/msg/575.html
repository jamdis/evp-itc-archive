Hi All, Jaime... If you use a digital recorder, you don't always need background noise to generate the EVPs. It depends on if you're doing an inside investigation or an outside invetigation. Outside, there's enough noise generated naturally. Inside, my team has found the more active WE are, the more active THEY are. We are trying to figure out if the energy they use is AC or DC generated, or what frequency they are on as well. The act of them imprinting voices is the 1st step in finding out what scientific measures they use to doso. 
  We know they do it, the HOW is what we're trying to find out at this point. 
  We're currently testing different set ups in the field. 
  We had a live feed mic running thru a mixer hooked up to the laptop running Acid Pro. When there was an active wave on the read out, we'd stop it, listen, and then respond to them immediately. It was as close to a "real time" conversation as we could get.
  We also had our normal digital voice recorders active, as well as one recorder set up in an insulated box. The purpose for this was to see if it's the background noise they use to imprint the EVPs, or if they use the EM waves to imprint them. We are in process of analyzing the material. It was a 9 hour overnight investigation. Normally, it takes 3 hrs per every hour recorded to analyze. We had a live mic feed, and 3 digital records - 2 out, 1 in the box. So you can imagine how much time it's going to take us to get thru all of the material.
  Your best bet is to forgo the whole whitenoise deal, and just have a radio playing in the background at a low level. The reason for this, is that they will use the voices and music from the radio to produce what they want to say. Our speech has been transformed at certain points as well. Someone on the team will say something, and then on theplayback, it's completely different and set into an EVP.
  Hope this helps,
  Chris :)

          Hi Misty,

Thank you for the reply and the advices! I'll keep experimenting with 
several setups. I think i'll try to play the white noise through a 
speaker and record via microphone.

What about EVPMaker, do you get good results with it? I haven't 
studied it but i have some doubts regarding how exactly the spirits 
manage to imprint the voices, since it's a digital process?!

Regards,
Jaime.
