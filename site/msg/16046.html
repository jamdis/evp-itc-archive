LOL April no kidding. I think maybe what he means is HE will go crazy if HE=
 tries. LOL that statement says alot. You might go crazy with or without do=
ing spirit communication. You might do alot of things. You might jump off a=
 tall building some day. You might die tomorrow. Might and will are words b=
ased on=A0ones own theories of what "could" happen.
=A0
I think if you take=
 a look around you will find a number of respectable people, scholars, inve=
ntors, teachers, policemen, firemen, military, clergy, and prominent figure=
s in our society have had personal experiences which force them to disagree=
 with that statement. In fact the bible is full of them (for those who take=
 them at their word) as are most histories and cultures worldwide. So milli=
ons of people are crazy or one guy is wrong....hmm tough decision but again=
 try it for yourself before you form YOUR opinion people =3D) I did and I h=
ave my own experiences to rely on.

My problem is as you said...the BS, like "you'll=
 go crazy if you try to speak with the dead." He has no real evidence to ba=

=A0
If he said, "In my =

This is why I tell everyone don't take my word for it try it for yourself=

hen Rorke makes his living on hoax news and to him this is news. I can't bl=
ame anyone for questioning the reality around them. But I can take a look a=
t what else a person has had to contribute to the world and the feild of st=
udy they claim to be in.=A0 I suggest you all do the same before you take s=
omeones ideas and make them your own. He has a right to form his own opinio=
n, experiment and get his own results, and believe whatever he wishes. But =
so do I.
=A0
Based on my own experiments, my own results, my own experience=
s, I form=A0MY own opinions and beliefs. As for the spiricom communication =
device all I can say is its interesting but I was not there, I did not expe=
riement with it, I have no results with which to base an opinion on. All we=
 have left is some recorded data, and heresay.
=A0
As for=A0Frank's box and=
 Sweep Tuning I can say I have seen the results, I have experimented with S=
T myself and I have received some astounding results which are message comm=
unications that are outside of my own knowledge and my own ability to contr=
ol or create. I have used many methods for EVP and ITC and have had many in=
teresting results that have been confirmed, recognized, and proved beyond a=
 shadow of=A0MY own doubt. This is=A0MY personal experience and I invite an=
yone who wishes to know more to try it for themselves and get their own res=
ults rather than waste time trying to pick apart others ideas, theories or =
results. I never try and prove anything to anyone else because for each of =
us it takes that one very personal experience to have that eye opening mome=
nt and realize that there is more around us than what is apparent.
=A0
So n=
o I am not offended by anything anyone has to say as long as they base thie=
r statements on truth rather than BS. And we all know there are alot of peo=
ple who make their life revolve around the BS as well as try to profit from=
 it.
=A0
My best advice would be to try it in depth before you form an opin=

be the same but that is YOUR experience, not mine, to explore further.

My journey has been quite fascinating, educational, and enlightening. I cou=
