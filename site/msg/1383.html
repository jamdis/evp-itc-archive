<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have several Mp3 files posted on here and i&#x27;d like to hear if 
people pick up what i did.  Maybe you heard something else.  I think 
there are like 13 mp3&#x27;s i posted.  Oak7 mp3 is kinda creepy because 
it doesn&#x27;t use the radio.  It actually sounds like a real EVP saying 
Philip.  Really clear and doesn&#x27;t sound like it came from the radio 
and by the way i was alone and all the samples are as they were.  I 
didn&#x27;t slow or speed them up or enhance them to make them clearer.

Thanx,
-Steve

&gt; Steve, Very nice feature that you can adjust the speed of the 
sweep. 
&gt; I look forward to hearing more about your work. - Bill

&gt; &gt; This is just a really fast generated FM sweep which is automatic 
&gt; and 
&gt; &gt; just goes up and down the band.  My friend has been working on 
&gt; these 
&gt; &gt; for me and i&#x27;m trying them out and starting to get results.  It 
&gt; &gt; really takes an aquired ear to catch it real time though, better 
&gt; &gt; success playing it back later.  I can slow the randomness down, 
but 
&gt; &gt; than people will just say it was a radio station.  I&#x27;m sure 
&gt; everyone 
&gt; &gt; knows how that goes.  I feel if it&#x27;s really fast like i&#x27;ve done 
it, 
&gt; &gt; it&#x27;s really not on a station long enough to get a sentence 
&gt; &gt; out...Right???

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Steve, I heard 50&#x27;s also. I think there may also be a 
&gt; &gt; message 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before your question but I am unable to make that part out. 
Is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; your 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; radio manual or automatic sweep?
