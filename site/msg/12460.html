<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>obviously steve, you fail to remember when just a week ago i had to
apologize to you for asking you a question that i had no idea you and
the other person did not speak? i was only interested in the
technology and furthering itc research. but i guess that one question
came across too smug.

you said to black bear that he doesn&#x27;t know you he dislikes you. I
don&#x27;t think that is the case at all. i still don&#x27;t have a problem with
you either. all i ever wanted to do is talk about the research you
were doing.

I now have 2 frank&#x27;s boxes (the GHOSTMAN 3 and FB#33) to do my
research. (btw.. i thanks you a bunch already frank.. so thank you again)

Steve, you come across as an expert is all i am saying. that is why i
contacted you. &quot;boxmaster estraordinaire&quot; is it? For you to say &quot;who
is this guy?&quot; and cause problems for a mutual friend is absurd. so..
for you and everyone to know a little about me...

oct 22 i turn 33 years old. I have been interested in the box
technology for a few years now. i have been doing paranormal
investigations for 19 years now and took a 3 year break (which is when
you popped up on the scene.) Now i&#x27;m back and hitting it hard again
and want to be able to use the best equipment that money can&#x27;t buy.

Frank doesn&#x27;t even pretend to be an expert nor does he expect his name
to be mentioned every time an article is published. anyways.. i
probably said more than i should have already.

bear... i&#x27;m up for that duel.. sounds fun...lol best one wins a
&quot;certificate of expertification&quot; sign by the us president...lol

btw.. one rule bear... no cutting and pasting clips together to make
one up. haha

&gt; I never claimed to be the first on the RS hack, i just posted the 
&gt; first files from it.  I have no ego and have many friends on here 
&gt; that could attest to that, i educate what i have learned along the 
&gt; way and that&#x27;s all.  No recording duels here, nobody cares anyway.  
&gt; What would that serve?  I only have helped people on here and other 
&gt; boards.

&gt; &gt; Actually I don&#x27;t know you and therefore can&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; say if I like you or not. I will say that I&#x27;ve heard
&gt; &gt; who first came up with the RS Hack and your
&gt; &gt; name wasn&#x27;t it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have posted many of my recordings to this
&gt; &gt; list, but don&#x27;t store them here. I&#x27;ve also heard
&gt; &gt; your files. So? Nothing I haven&#x27;t heard before,
&gt; &gt; but as always I enjoy listening to everyone&#x27;s efforts.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What I don&#x27;t like is an attitude and egomania
&gt; &gt; when it comes to this research.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Next I guess you&#x27;ll challenge me to a recording
&gt; &gt; duel? LOL. Give that ego a rest.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You&#x27;re right and i&#x27;m not here to argue with anyone. You obviously
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#x27;t know me, but dislike me. That&#x27;s ok, i like to get along with
&gt; &gt; &gt; people; it helps the research move forward. I would love to hear 
&gt; some
&gt; &gt; &gt; of your files from your frank&#x27;s boxes and compare notes on what 
&gt; we&#x27;ve
&gt; &gt; &gt; been getting. My results are in the files section here.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So have I. So has Misty. So has Frank. Mike too. I could go on 
&gt; &amp; on.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are many here and on other lists who have contributed 
&gt; years of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; free time way before you showed up on the recording scene.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does it matter? No.
