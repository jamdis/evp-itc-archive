I will go back to the drawing board and reprogram my evpmaker and my brain.  Will give it another go.  \n   \n  Couple comments regarding your comments.  One, I have had limited experience recording traditional evps and have been able to hear and recognize messages.  I can also hear about 80 percent of the messages posted here by others...true the written description makes it vastly more easy to do so.  I recognize that I need a lot of practice deciphering my own session and I intend to do that.    Like Bruce and a few others here, I feel very positive about using evpmr  with stefan&#39;s enhancements and due to my signal problems with radio it is the only thing I will focus on for now.    Thanks again for making time for me.  Ron L\n   \n  \nitcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hi Ron.
