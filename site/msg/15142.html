No but here's the deal behind it. You expect to hear and record voices so y=
ou do. Again, though I think this does happen alot, called matrixing, not a=
ll such instances are this.

        That's funny! =
They never say what I expect them to say. LOL As a matter of fact they are =
really good about saying shit that don't make sense until it happens later.=
 Or, I would get messages for Misty or Laura and even Sumption that made no=
 sense to me what-so-ever because those were the other folks within our cir=
cle.

        I look at the "help me's", the "nasty ones" and others as lev=
els of our own contact evolution or levels we work past to get to the ones =
who can speak coherantly. Those voices fade as you concentrate on positive =
messages instead of YOU getting stuck listening to the "scared and lost" fo=
lks.

        As for making your own realities after you die, I follow a Br=
uce Moen style viewpoint where there are what is called Hollow heavens and =
hells. You go where you feel you deserve or see what you expect to see, but=
 only for a while. You slowly are brought out of those realities by helpers=
 whose job it is to do so. Anyways, just a thought! One of many!

   This crap I hear about people supposedly crossing over stuck souls with =

          Does not anyone get the concept that you create what you=
 expect in the paranormal? If you think there's hauntings, you create the e=
vidence to support that. If you think there's stuck souls you'll have no sh=
ortage of ghosts screaming for your superhuman help. Of course, you also cr=
eate the illusion of being the big expert as well-which is what I think man=
y want most.

          Just a suggestion-- but grow up people!
