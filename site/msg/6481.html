&gt; Hi Steve   Good stuff on youtube.  I have been trying to get a 
technical friend of mine into this for quite some time but never have 
approached him.  He has been doing telephone work for many years and 
loves gadgets.  Your video should perk his interest because of all 
the techie stuff...I will invite him to join this group to hear good 
evp samples.  
&gt;    
&gt;   Maybe I missed it but don&#x27;t you have the new RS hack 20-125?  I 
would love to see it..
