Yeah (Ron) no matter the method in the end I think its all about the tones =
and our perception of them as well as our equipments ability to reproduce t=
hem. I use x-bass speakers hooked up thru an equalizer to my pc so what I h=
ear isnt always what others hear on thier systems. I am more surprised when=
 they hear it the same as I do. When I listen to some voices on another spe=
aker setup sometimes the voices tones are lost and cant hear anything, whil=
e others voice are well recieved on any setup. I am unsure why, nor am I su=
re why some days they come in clearer than others.

As you requested heres =
a couple more water files from a recent session that I found to be very cle=
ar. I was discussing Otto and his &quot;replacement&quot; with them that week as well=
 as running some experiments redoing a few audio/visual tests I&#x27;d done in t=
he past.

The session from the next day I was saying hello to my friends wh=
o have passed and asked they wish my mother a happy birthday for me that da=
y. My birthday is a couple weeks away from hers so this year I guess its a =
happy birthday early (I can kinda hear early on the end of that one how abo=
ut you?)
