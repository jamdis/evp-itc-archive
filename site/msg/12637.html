<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I already got one response saying all they hear is music. The noise on
this file is not a voice, it may indeed be a piece of music, but it
seems to have some of the phonetic qualities of speech. I think most
people will just hear &quot;a noise&quot; or a note of music, but if any one
hears more let me know.

&gt; I got this recording while out yesterday doing recordings with my
&gt; radio shack hack ghost box. I just posted it to my newly created
&gt; folder titled &quot;John Frick&quot;. I have a definite thought on what it says
&gt; but I fully realize that our perception can be colored by what we
&gt; expect to hear (our perception can also be colored by whatever someone
&gt; has said they hear, so please try to listen to it before reading
&gt; others opinions on it). I would like to get as many people&#x27;s
&gt; interpretations of what this might be saying as possible. If you have
&gt; more than one idea for what it is saying I&#x27;d like to hear it. You can
&gt; post here or email me at jfrick45@...
&gt; 
&gt; I diminished the static before and after the voice/noise to reduce the
&gt; irritation level of playing this multiple times. Any help with
&gt; identification would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ll update the file later with what words that seem most likely.
