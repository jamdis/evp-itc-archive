I have \nveryu few\n&gt; of these, and out of four I had in the junk box, only two work. \nThese are\n&gt; weak, almost like regular EVP. Rigel is one that comes through \nevery once in\n&gt; awhile, not sure if that his name, or home, as sometimes he \nsays &quot;this is\n&gt; your friend from Rigel&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  It&#39;s still looking like the sound chamber is completely un needed, \nand may\n&gt; even hamper the voices. What I get form the Ghostman, and even \ndirectly from\n&gt; a tuenr module is easier to understand that the ones through an \nsound\n&gt; chamber and mic amplifiers. the Gostman in direct mode yields \nlongs, and\n&gt; more coherent voices than the original box, at least compared to \nwhat I was\n&gt; getting last night.\n&gt; Tonight I&#39;ll modifiy #32 to get either direct recordings out of the \ntuner,\n&gt; or through the sound chamber so I can compare.  I had one from \n2/5/08 from\n&gt; the Ghostman that said &quot;that Earthquake will occur-------on the \nisland near\n&gt; Chile (Falklands?).  There was a EQ today off Brazil, but no island \nthere.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  DRV=direct radio voice\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; Connect and share in new ways with Windows Live.
