I did it with my brother&#39;s fatherinlaw 2 days after he died.  My technician helped me out and went and got this guy for me and I just about flipped when his voice actually came over the radio.  Unfortunately it did not record.  It was only meant for my ears.\n   \n  Jeff\n   \n    In a message dated 4/23/2008 11:58:46 A.M.

I just had a death in my Family, and I \n&gt; was wandering if anybody does a session today/or tonight if you could \n&gt; try to get in contact with a Mr. Charlie Clarke,(my Great Uncle) or \n&gt; Mrs. Joann Clarke(his wife has past a couple of months ago)to see if \n&gt; you can contact them. If you do contact him can you tell him that \n&gt; Rees will be asking to speak with them tonight around 7-8pm eastern \n&gt; time. To see if they can contact me. They lived a long and \n&gt; wonderful life together. So all my family is sad to see him go, but \n&gt; we know it was his time to leave, and life goes on. He should be \n&gt; happy to be back with his wife. (He was 83 years old) I know \n&gt; probaly somebody here might think this is crazy, dumb or \n&gt; disrespectful, but that is my business. I think it should be easy to \n&gt; get in contact with him since he just crossed over. Please let me \n&gt; know if you tried and any evidence you might get from him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; William Rees\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
