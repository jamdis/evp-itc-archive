<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Juli!  They usually acknowledge my sister too whenever she  
walks in.  I can&#x27;t tell what she thinks of it, though.

&gt; Good file Nick!  I see the apple don&#x27;t fall far from the tree!   
&gt; It&#x27;s funny my girls love when I do spirit communication as well.   
&gt; My 10 daughter thinks they are my new friends!  She is always  
&gt; wanting to know if they can in fact see us because they always  
&gt; acknowledge here when she walks into the room.  I wonder if she as  
&gt; a unique energy about her?  What ever it is, she wants me to buy  
&gt; her a box of her own, too bad she is way too young.
