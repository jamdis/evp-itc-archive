<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Have ya tried EVPmaker? It is based on that random principle, and 
predates the boxes.

 I&#x27;ve heard this stuff before, about random being the best, and I 
have to disaggree. I also think it unwise to spend every waking 
moment doing sessions. I think it creates that expectation, and 
perhaps desperation to make contact, and I would tend not to trust 
what comes through. 

 I don&#x27;t trust some of this stuff because I have yet get any 
meaningful assistence with the boxes from the so called technicians. 
All I ever got was a telepathic &quot;suggestion&quot; to use the echo boxes. 
Everything else was a assemblage of stuff I had worked on in hte past 
to solve the problem of &quot;what else could I use&quot;. 

 I hate to see yet another go down the road of &quot;this is the onlyest 
way&quot;.
