<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello Frank,

   Thanks for mentioning the buzzing, I was hoping the buzzing wasn&#x27;t
part of the design :-) I&#x27;ll get a scope on it and check it out, I
didn&#x27;t want to mess with it for fear that I might be changing
something that was intended for communication in the circuit.

During the session we did change the location of the box because of
all of the buzzing thinking it may have been some noisy wiring nearby,
but it did not make a difference, so we just went with it.

Thanks
Craig T

&gt; Hi Craig;
&gt; 
&gt; That buzzing is awful! I can&#x27;t hear much beyond that. If anyone can,
have a 
&gt; tech check the power supply voltages at the board, there should be
plus and 
&gt; minus 12 volts for the RVG, and pus 12 for the audio/tuner section.
Look at 
&gt; it with a scope, maybe there a bad regulator, or bad power switch
section. 
&gt; The way it is, that box is about useless.
