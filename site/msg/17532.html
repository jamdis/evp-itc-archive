<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanx for the great encouragement Tim.  I appreciate you taking the time to listen.  I rarely do regular recordings anymore, usually just test sessions after i get something working.

Thing is, i don&#x27;t ask questions in my test sessions and they seem to talk more and tell me what i need to know.  I should have shut up a long time ago and listen to Frank....LOL

&gt; Very impressive.  It sounds like the scan is flying through the channels. 
&gt; 
&gt; Even though it was a test session, it was very active. There is a lot of communication in there that I don&#x27;t have time to analyze right now but a few things really came across after listening to it only a couple times:  
&gt; 
&gt; I heard the name Jacob several times.  
&gt; 
&gt; You were also called out @.36 secs &quot;Hey Steven.&quot;  
&gt; 
&gt; Near the end, @.57, I hear the word &quot;listen&quot; said three times in a row with the last one being &quot;Listen To.&quot; followed by a &quot;It was Frank&quot; @1.00 then a &quot;thank you.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; There is a woman who is very prevalent in this test and she seems to be the clearest voice of them all.  She comes across with individual words, not statements.  Starting with &quot;Jacob&quot; at .01, she can also be heard saying:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;He&quot; .32
&gt; &quot;Didn&#x27;t&quot; .33 
&gt; &quot;Open&quot; .40
&gt; &quot;Let&quot; .50
&gt; &quot;Us&quot; .51
&gt; 
&gt; I find this clip very interesting and I love the way it sounds; I&#x27;m very impressed with this modification.  Even the cycle over of the band provides very minimal dead scan time.

&gt; &gt;  That sounds about a hundred times better than my junk, I think it&#x27;s time to
&gt; &gt; abandon what I&#x27;ve been doing for years with great dissatifaction, and copy
