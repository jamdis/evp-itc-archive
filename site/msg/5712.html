 felt they needed <BR>or <BR>> wanted to employ it. it is a simple innoc=
ent 
  prayer ritual, I <BR>don't <BR>> think it is really worthy of all=
 this 
  debate.Use it, don't use <BR>it. <BR>> It's there if you want i=

  must say there are two kinds of <BR>> fear the kind that is=
 natural and a 
  god given emotion for self <BR>> preservation, ie the =
fright and flight 
  reflex that is an <BR>instinctive <BR>> trait in al=
l of us. Then you have 
  the irrational dibilitating <BR>phobic <BR>> f=
ear that can turn an 
  individual into a frozen statue. That type <BR>of <=
BR>> fear I believe is 
  unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt wit=
h <BR>and <BR>> learned how 
  to harness. I also believe that anyone th=
at harbors <BR>that <BR>> type of 
  fear would not be drawn to the para=
normal anyway and in a <BR>> case of 
  such fear it would already be pr=
esent and doing a small <BR>> protection 
  ritual would not fuel it any=
 further. So lets take it <BR>for <BR>> what it
