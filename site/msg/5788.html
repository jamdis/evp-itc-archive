ST methods works fine whether its auto scanning or you are manually scanning (turning the knob yourself). I kinda like the manual version only because sometimes they ask me to go back to a section of the band and record between freq.
   
  Many methods to choose from these days you just have to find the method that works best for you.

Yeah, as soon as Sum put the hack out there it seems like there are 
many radios that could have the potential for ghost box 
functionality. If it has a scan feature, it has potential to be 
hacked or in this case no hack involved. If people do not want to 
hold the scan button down, you can use an old clothes line pin to 
hold it down for you. I asked our friends on the other side if my 
new job was to find hackable radios and they said "yes" loud and 
clear. The first time i asked what my job was months ago they 
answered "To Teach Others". These ideas just keep hitting me and 
they are so simple anyone could figure these out. Maybe we were 
looking for harder solutions to the idea of a "ghost box". It seems 
simple ideas have taken the lead thanx to Sum for getting the idea 
out there and ball rolling on this one.
