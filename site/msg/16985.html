As has been said, one of=A0=A0the most likely explanations for the Ouija is=
 the working of the mind.
What is somewhat at issue, as is so often the cas=
e when discussing apparent discarnate 
communications, is the actual source=
 of the apparent intelligence.

Micromuscular reactions do indeed appear to=
 be one source of the Ouija when operators are
in contact with the planchet=
te. But this is only one category of Ouija interactions. There is
another c=
ompletely different category where no operator is touching the board or the=
 planchette,
and yet it moves and remains in motion, often changing directi=
ons or flying off the board. This
type of activity is more akin to psychoki=
nesis, the mind affecting the environment.

Both types of activity could be=
 mediated in the mind of a living operator, and in fact modern
parapsycholo=
gy research suggest this is the most reasonable explanation. But again the =

source of the information thus presented is at question and is currently u=
nknown.

Against this backdrop it would seem that it would be quite difficu=
lt to demonstrate with
any clarity or precision that any specific individua=
l (living or deceased) was indeed affecting
the Ouija (or any other device =
for that matter). It would all come down to beliefs which is the
best we ca=
n hope for at this time.

So 'scientific' proof per se is off the table if =
you define 'scientific' in the classic sense.
If you mean objective proof, =
in some way documenting activity such as by video for example,
that is a di=
fferent matter. But to be very clear, this would not be considered scientif=
ic proof
because you are cannot demonstrate the causation. You can however =
document the effect.

Blood Mary (the ritual of Mary Worth) is considered b=
y most to be folk-legend. So it would 
be difficult, would it not, to ascer=
tain who in fact you were communicating with. And again, 
there is a real p=
ossiblity, based on existing lab=A0research from the past many decades that=
 
you just might be communicating with yourself.

Best of luck in your ende=
avors!

Hey guys,

I am doing some research on the Bloody Mary rit=
ual and Ouija Boards. I am=A0 
looking for anyone with stories or experienc=
es from those that would be 
willing=A0 to share them - as well as any rese=
arch and evidence you may have 
gathered from=A0 them. I am looking to brin=
g the folklore together with the 
history, science and=A0 experience.

Than=
ks.
