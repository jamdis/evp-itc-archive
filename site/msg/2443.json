They answer &quot;No&quot; and i repeat for confirmation &quot;No&quot; and than they say it again to confirm what i heard was right. Getting answers to questions that you ask is beneficial to this.  Of course i could get messages without saying a word, but isn&#39;t better to know when a message is coming so you can review that section of audio to find the answer.  \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Simple%20FM%20Sweep%20Radio%20Design/no_no.mp3 \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/help/us/groups/files\n\nRegards,\n\nurkel232002 &lt;urkel23@...&gt;"}
