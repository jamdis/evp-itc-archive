I have been actively involved with the paranormal field for three years.
I =
went to the Stanley hotel last year in March. I have seen the digital dowsi=
ng work.
I did have at the time, a shack hack, from the last time we went i=
n November 15th 07
there was a digital dowsing=A0 used in the concert hall,=
 the voice asked for Jason a lot.
We stayed in room 418 one night, the same=
 voice asked for Jason again,( well all night)
while we used our shack hack=
. it had said the same things as in the concert hall.
So that is what I hav=
e been using, I want to use one here in Seattle.
the shack hack works 50/50=
 % of the time. to many stations here, to 
pick up on. A little insight. I =
live in Ballard, an old fishing community.
they were to put a monorail righ=
t in the heart of Ballard.
there is a lot of activity here, with taring dow=
n old homes. 
to build condo's , there is a lot of unhappy activity here. 
=
story now, I was investigating a home on 24th the Friday before labor day w=
eekend
I had the hack shack going, we were going to shut it off, When a wom=
ans 
voice came over and said clear as day" turn around". so we did and not=
hing 
it said it again turn around. well we saw=A0 a house three house down=
 and across the street.
then less then five minute later a aid car, fire an=
d the police was there.
the lady who lived there was found dead?=A0 Well I =
use that every time from then on.
but what if I had the digital dowsing the=
