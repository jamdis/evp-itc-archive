Everyone's files are sounding great!  I  haven't had time to comment on 
each individual file, but have listened, and  heard them all.  One good way to 
keep some lower spirits from infiltrating  your mind, is to simply say, The 
Lord's Prayer, and they will go away  packing.  I hear them so clearly now 
on my RS 150, it's unreal, I do turn  them off more often now, because it 
gets like Grand Central Station in here  sometimes.  Luckily, I am getting more 
of the higher spirit people now,  less of the little nasty's, since they 
all got to try to get into the light  Realms now, otherwise they will find 
themselves in total darkness soon "when the  door gets shut for 1000 years."   
From what David the Spirit tech  says, "we all did get a reprieve though 
from world destruction," "God wants to  give us another chance to see if we, as 
a people will repent our ways, become  more spiritual, and come to Him as a 
human race."  Don't know how God  intends to convert this world to loving 
Him, but sometimes He just can turn bad  tings into good ones.  Thank God 
that TX is now getting some rain, they  have had a terrible drought for long 
time.  Things may get bad again for  some with what Muslim are trying to take 
away parts of Israel to form Palestine,  why not use some of the upper 
Arabia, it's vast place of sand, but with  technology being what it is now, they 
could send water into the desert  places.  Just a thought,
sf
