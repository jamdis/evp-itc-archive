<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The system is all anaolog. The random tuning voltage being derived from 
white noise. For the newer linear tuning, the voltage is only a triangle 
wave with a very slow frequency, like .3 hz. It turns out, you don&#x27;t need 
random, and maybe a steady tuing rate is better, as in tuning the radio 
across the band by hand. I think all that is required is broken up audio 
that can be rearranged. This stuff seems to defy theory, and definition, 
just when you think you have it figured out, it seems to work in a different 
manor. Maybe it&#x27;s just supposed to make us nuts, an open our minds up in 
that way?

There&#x27;s a reason I give my stuff away, cuz I don&#x27;t want to go down that road 
of needing to make more money, even if just to pay for parts. I&#x27;m sure it 
would start out good, but the darkness of the soul would creep up, demanding 
a bigger cut. I&#x27;m sure that one user of my boxes feels justified in his 
actions, almost as if he&#x27;s doing god&#x27;s work, but I still feel like I&#x27;ve been 
abused.
