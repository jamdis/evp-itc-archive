<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello all,

First post.  I want to get started with this stuff, and figured the best place would be EVP.  I got an IC recorder and am ready to go.  I have a few questions though.

At my friend&#x27;s house there is *something* that likes to make noises when it knows you can hear it.  It&#x27;ll make big loud footsteps and generally try to scare the crap out of you.  It would seem like a good place to start buuuuut I don&#x27;t know if attempting to communicate with it will make things worse.  Good idea?  Bad idea?  Does it matter?

I really wanted to tryout that allophone + EVPMaker combo that seems to be generating some good results.  EVP voices are so faint it&#x27;s incredibly hard for me to make them out at this point.

Lastly, how do you deal with family and relatives that disapprove of this stuff?  I live alone (well, with a roommate) and they seem to think I&#x27;m getting into some sort of voodoo or sorcery or something.  They seem to think that the voices are all demons or something.  I don&#x27;t know how to explain it to them, I wish I could get them to understand.  I am generally a curious person so it was only a matter of time before I actually started with this stuff.

Thanks for reading!  :)</pre>
