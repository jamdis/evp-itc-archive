The labels you give can influence the listeners: when yo=\r\nu have a sound that could be several things, and you note that it sounded l=\r\nike &quot;keep it moving&quot;, the listener can find it nearly impossible to try NOT=\r\n to hear what you heard, and so not be able to give a fresh perspecive to h=\r\nelp your research methods.\n\n  --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;James W.
