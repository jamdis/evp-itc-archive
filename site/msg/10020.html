<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>For what it&#x27;s worth, I seperate out a segment that has the phrase, 
and usually don&#x27;t filter, or cut anything out of it. I don&#x27;t try to 
get rid of any &quot;garbage&quot; in between words. I too consider that 
suspicous--really suspicious. Except for Stefan, I&#x27;ve been doing this 
box crap longer than anyone here, and I find the level of ego amongst 
the &quot;researchers&quot; disturbing. 

 I&#x27;ve said it before, and I&#x27;ll say it again, I don&#x27;t ask questions. 
The spirits/entities are in fact in a higher state of being, they 
know what you need to know, they know when you are listening and 
recording. There are no acidental &quot;captures&quot;. Asking questions is 
presumptuous at best, who here is wise enough to question the angels 
God, or spirit!? Why not just record? Let them speak.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I 
would
&gt; suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, 
in
&gt; order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can 
for
&gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip 
(including
&gt; the experimenter&#x27;s voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, 
but
&gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP 
match
&gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should 
always
&gt; be provided along with the edited version.
&gt; 
&gt; But that&#x27;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to 
express, as
&gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical 
public.

&gt; &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these 
files.
&gt; &gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that 
&gt; &gt; section down about 20%.  Now i can actually start to hear the 
message 
&gt; &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise 
that 
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t belong and eliminate them from the mix.  You can&#x27;t piece 
these 
&gt; &gt; files together to make something it&#x27;s not, so i keep them in true 
&gt; &gt; form pretty much to the original.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hey Steve   Forgot to ask...how much editing was needed to get 
this 
&gt; &gt; file?  Did you need to take out a lot of garbage between words 
&gt; &gt; withing the message?   Ron L
