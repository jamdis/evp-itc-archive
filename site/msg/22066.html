<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is SPIRIT_RADIO, my normally used account is FUBAR so I need to use this one. I have a week off from school and actually have some time to say hey. Still need to read back through the posts to catch up.

Since Halloween is right around the corner, I&#x27;m checking around for an investigation to participate in. Not that Halloween has anything to do with it! Well okay, a little. 

Steve, Ralph, Tracy, any interest in getting another investigation under way? Is Tanya still kicking around here? 

Regards,

Mark</pre>
