If he can&#39;t wrap his mind around the significance of radio sweep then mention others like the water method. I regularly use the sound of my laptop cooling fan for the dynamic sound needed. Hell, I recorded on the way home from work Friday by using the sound of the cars road noise and my window slightly cracked. Here is one I use for live communication; phototransistors in combination with spinning lasers, fed through DC6 and sound soap 2. No radio signals used there, just light!\n\nI have heard the argument before about CB skip, SW noise and others like it. It is a very weak argument!
