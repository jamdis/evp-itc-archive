I agree that this can be the case-that alot of times people create what the=
y believe or want to be true when it comes to the paranormal. However it is=
n't always the case.

As far as helping stuck souls cross over using the bo=
x-I have yet to see any real evidence of that.

 This crap I hear about people supposedly crossing over stuck souls with a =
box? 

  Does not anyone get the concept that you create what you expect in=
 the paranormal? If you think there's hauntings, you create the evidence to=
 support that. If you think there's stuck souls you'll have no shortage of =
ghosts screaming for your superhuman help. Of course, you also create the i=
llusion of being the big expert as well-which is what I think many want mos=
t.

  Just a suggestion--but grow up people!
