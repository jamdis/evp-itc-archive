But I dont know of a way to slow down the sweep.  Are you using the AM or FM band? And have you tried switching to the other band(the one ur not using)?  Ive tried a session on the FM band but it doesnt really seem to work for some reason but the AM does good and Ive gotten a response that indicates that they agree with the AM being better here.\n   \n  Rhonda\n  \n\njudy_in_hollywood &lt;Ticket_to_Heaven@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hi All, Have been doing sessions and sometimes get a voice or more that \njust jumps in and says a word or two durring the scan, but most of the \ntime it seems it&#39;s like a room full of people talking very fast and \nthus I can&#39;t seem to hear them well enough to hear if they are giving \nme any messages! Am I the only one with this issue? How can I slow this \ndown to hear better? =Judy= P.S. I only use the RS 12-469 with \nportable folding Craig speakers & a Sony cassette recorder with \nearphones (cups over ears). I sometimes use an external mic or just the \ncassette recorder&#39;s mic.\n\n\n\n                           \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nNever miss a thing.
