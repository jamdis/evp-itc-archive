<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is very weird, Frank. I was just explaining to someone about the  
Fish Group and what the name supposedly meant and up pops this. I  
have to think that the same entities are popping around between us  
and perhaps heard this conversation I had a few days ago just after I  
had finished a session.

&gt;  The &quot;I&#x27;m a fish&quot; is bad sign, that&#x27;s the &#x27;Fish Group&#x27; that was  
&gt; troubling the European researchers ( sorry, memory malfunction)  
&gt; back in the 90&#x27;s. This is supposedly a group that lives on Jupiter,  
&gt; and they delight in screwing with EVPers. Some in AAEVP may have  
&gt; heard of these charactors.

&gt;  Judging by the amount of negatives here, I would think this is  
&gt; good developement, they just don&#x27;t want me working with shortwave.
