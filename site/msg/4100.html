<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ahh... thanks, Juli!
By-the-way, today I listened to an interview you did not long ago.  
You have a lot of knowledge and experience. I&#x27;d love to get you on my 
show sometime... if that&#x27;s okay with you.
It&#x27;s at http://www.ghosttoghostpm.com

Let me know what you think about being a guest.
Thanks!

- Mike

&gt; yes I actually do.  Chris was in a band called cold moon, thus the 
name Chris Moon was born.

&gt; While doing some internet reading this evening I came across a few 
&gt; articles which led me to think that Chris Moon may be a &quot;stage 
name&quot; 
&gt; for the person actually named, Chris Huff (Christopher Edward Huff 
to 
&gt; be exact). I see his daughters last name is Huff, and his fathers 
last 
&gt; name is Huff... so why isn&#x27;t his, Chris&#x27;, last name Huff? Anyone 
got 
&gt; the 411 on this a.k.a.?
&gt; 
&gt; Here are the three articles I found:
