Copper is next best at 59.6 E06 S/m. Gold is not the best, at\n45.2 E06 S/m. Aluminum is much farther down, at 37.8 E06 S/m.\n\nSilver and gold are expensive. They are usually used to plate RF assemblies\nwhere the skin effect takes place (current doesn&#39;t flow uniformly through a\nconductor at RF frequencies but mainly travels at the surface of the\nconductor). Gold has the advantage that it never tarnishes or corrodes with\nmost things it is exposed to. It&#39;s used a lot in contacts for rotary\nswitches and relays.\n\nZack\n\nOn Wed, May 27, 2009 at 9:38 AM, Golden Phoenix\n&lt;golden_phoenix42@yahoo.com&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    Firrst Electrical job I was on as a helper in 1976 was to pick up a\n&gt; pole that was to feeding a house someone had wired in aluminum that had\n&gt; burned to the ground due to a bad connection it had just been built. I had\n&gt; been with my old man on a many job sinhce I was 8 and never had seen\n&gt; anything like that. Copper is the only way to gold only better conductor is\n&gt; Gold. but who can handle that in a house. worste case of emf I have ever\n&gt; seen was a fancy chandaler that someone had over sized bulbs in and that\n&gt; thing flared up the whole house to very dangerous levels. when they say 60\n&gt; watt max they mean it for your own safety. this thing had around 10 100 watt\n&gt; bulbs in it and the emfs were causing all kinds of nice images after 30\n&gt; minutes in the house we were having them too.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *http://www.myspace.com/ghost_hunter50*\n&gt; see my site links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Wed, 5/27/09, SnowfireL@... &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: SnowfireL@... &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Electrical Question\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, May 27, 2009, 8:47 AM\n&gt;\n&gt;   copper is a great conductor\n&gt;\n&gt;  In a message dated 5/27/2009 9:44:02 A.M.

The stuff tends to overheat, oxidizes where\n&gt; interconnections are made and will spark, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; I bought a transformer at Gateway Electronics in St. Louis some years ago\n&gt; that looked like a great transformer for a high-current 12 volt supply. The\n&gt; secondary appeared to be wound with #8 enameled wire. I found out the\n&gt; secondary was wound with aluminum wire. After I built the power supply and\n&gt; tried to get 20 amps from it but couldn&#39;t, I gave up on it and got another\n&gt; transformer wound with copper wire.\n&gt; Zack\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  On Wed, May 27, 2009 at 8:16 AM, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@\n&gt; gmail.com&lt;http://us.mc01g.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   We have a touch lamp that comes on by itself, and we have electric\n&gt;&gt; matress heaters that make a clicking noise in the radio when the controller\n&gt;&gt; is on.

Upon checking my\n&gt;&gt;&gt; logs, every time one of  these clicks were heard, there would be an EMF\n&gt;&gt;&gt; spike in the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livingroom\n&gt;&gt;&gt; downstairs. The home owners have also reported that they have a touch lamp\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that comes on all the time by itself and the lights in the Kitchen will dim\n&gt;&gt;&gt; occasionally.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Now these taps are not consistent in timing, loudness or rhythm.
