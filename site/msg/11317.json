I have been a paranormal\ninvestigator since 2006 and I have been very fortunate to record many\nmessages with digital and analog voice recorders.\n\nWithin my investigative groups, I have always been the EVP tech. I\nhave discovered that there are many more angles to EVP than just\nstraight recording.\n\nI joined your group to learn more and boy I have been so fascinated\nwith all the talk among you all with your equipment.\n\nHow should I start? Who can give me some good advice on what I should\ntry next? I am not gifted to be able to build things, maybe unless\nthey are very easy.\n\nI would travel (with time to plan it) if I was able to learn more\nabout other methods for capturing evp.\n\nThank you for your time to read my message and hopefully you can help me."}
