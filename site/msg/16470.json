The one on EVPS: (http://www.haunteda\n&gt;&gt; mericatours. com/EVP/EVP/ &lt;http://www.hauntedamericatours.com/EVP/EVP/&gt;)\n&gt;&gt; does show her presumptions, and she  presents many of the issues and\n&gt;&gt; potentials for &quot;false positives&quot; that I assume all experienced EVP\n&gt;&gt; researchers already know of.   But she also comments to the claims: &quot;My\n&gt;&gt; response to this is…provide the evidence! &quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So that would seem to me she would be open to a well-designed test to\n&gt;&gt; &quot;show her the evidence&quot;.  So I will contact her, suggest this sort of test,\n&gt;&gt; and even suggest that experts from this group would help to design and\n&gt;&gt; conduct the test - maybe even Frank - and let you know what she says.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- On *Thu, 12/31/09, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@gmail. com&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From: Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@gmail. com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Big Mistake!\n&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;&gt; Date: Thursday, December 31, 2009, 11:43 PM\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Nothing.

I thought she\n&gt;&gt;&gt; was someone off the group and has an interest in EVP and the boxes. She did\n&gt;&gt;&gt; mention she was a skeptic, but I didn&#39;t think debunker, or a professional\n&gt;&gt;&gt; skeptic--wonder who pays these twits?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  These skeptics don&#39;t allow themselves to hear anything, yet will\n&gt;&gt;&gt; proclaim that as proof the boxes and EVP don&#39;t work, as if their hearing is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; somehow better than the average persons ear. If a person doesn&#39;t want to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hear it, they won&#39;t, and because they can&#39;&#39;t hear EVP that means no one else\n&gt;&gt;&gt; an either.
