 Should we try to edit out some of these allophones on the master file as a test? Are they in order on the indexed file? 

Thanks,

Dave

Hi Bruce,

in fact one has to be cautious as to &quot;false positives&quot; when using this method, especially for 1-syllable words like &quot;(h)ear, &quot;air&quot; and &quot;I&quot;. Some of the SpeakJet allophones are diphthongs, e.g. #22 (&quot;IYRR&quot; like in &quot;Clear, Hear, Year&quot;), #23 (&quot;EYRR&quot; like in &quot;Hair, Stair, Repair&quot;), or #30 (&quot;OHIH&quot; like in &quot;Sky, Five, I&quot;). There are only 72 different allophones, so the probability that one-syllable words like &quot;(h)ear/here&quot; , &quot;air&quot;, and &quot;I&quot; appear, is relatively high.

I don&#x27;t assume that everything that is received by this method is true communication. As with every method, it depends on various factors like meaningfulness, relatedness, length of the message, etc., if a message is regarded as a valid EVP.

&gt; 
&gt; To all that are experimenting with the EVPM allaphone file method.
&gt; 
&gt; I have done a few sessions with this method as I know a  few other 
&gt; researchers have.
&gt; There have been a couple of researchers that have done sessions and 
&gt; gotten very similar responses such as the name &quot;Arthur&quot; and responses 
&gt; pertaining to &quot;Air&quot; also &quot;I am here&quot; or &quot;here&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I have also gotten direct and intelligible answers to questions 
&gt; immediately following the question, and messages that could never be 
&gt; construed as random.
&gt; 
&gt; The test that I propose and the answer I seek is, The words that keep 
&gt; coming up to almost all researchers experimenting with this method IE 
&gt; the words I mentioned above.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to find out whether these certain words are simply by 
&gt; products of everyone using the same file and come up as a result of 
&gt; the file playing in evpm, or are they true entity communication.
&gt; 
&gt; The only questionable content are these few words not all the methods 
&gt; communication. In my opinion the majority of the communication from 
&gt; this method is genuine.
&gt; The method has produced communication including my name to me as well 
&gt; as other researchers that have gotten my name, and some of the 
&gt; statements and responses show signs of a sense of humor that would 
&gt; surely be absent in random word grouping.
&gt; 
&gt; Who ever is involved with experimentation of this method, will you 
&gt; please on your next session ask that if there is a spirit named 
&gt; Arthur for him not to mention his name or the list of words that I 
&gt; have posted. I suggest that this request be made verbally before the 
&gt; session as well as after.
&gt; 
&gt; And in the most polite manner. They seem to respond better to 
&gt; formality.
&gt; 
&gt; please dedicate one session no shorter than 2 minutes to this 
&gt; experiment and post your results.
&gt; 
&gt; Your cooperation appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce
