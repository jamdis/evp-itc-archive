They say objects retain memory in some \ncases, like film or recording tape.  If that is the case you can place \nan object inside the container; an object which was once owned by a \nperson/spirit you are trying to contact.  The memory, if within the \nobject, could mix with the raw audio, white noise, and ambient noise \nwithin the sound chamber to be captured by the amplified microphone, \nwhich is fed to the recorder and the earphones or speaker.  The \ncontainer can be removed from the chamber if desired, since it is \nvelcro-ed onto the case, as are the other devices.\n\nYou can see the detailed photos here:\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com/?p=130\n\n- Mike"}
