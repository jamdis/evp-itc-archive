Just becau=\r\nse a voice might sound low and growly does not mean it is a lower life form=\r\n. If we hear a spirit voice that sounds week and feint, we think the spirit=\r\n is in pain or trouble. But that isn&#39;t necessarily the case. It could be th=\r\nat is all it could do at the moment due to any number of inhibiting factors=\r\n.. Breaking the dimensional barrier is probably not easy.\n\nJust like for us=\r\n living. You have a deep and resonant voice. That doesn&#39;t say much for your=\r\n class or personality, it is just the way your body was made. It wouldn&#39;t b=\r\ne right for me to think you were of a lower or higher stature than me becau=\r\nse of the sound of your voice.\n\nAlso, a voice may take on a different tone =\r\ndepending on how it is being transmitted.\n\nPeople also like to make stateme=\r\nnts about the color a spirit may appear in. Those assessment though are mad=\r\ne in human ignorance. For instance, if a ghost appears black, out of the ba=\r\nggage we humans have attached to that color, we automatically assign and ev=\r\nil label to it. But that isn&#39;t a proper assumption. It is our own inability=\r\n to remain objective. We see a color and we get an instant motor response. =\r\nThose responses are human in nature and imposed upon us by other&#39;s beliefs =\r\nor other environmental factors.\n\nBottom line is when it comes to this stuff=\r\n, you cannot assess anything based on beliefs. &quot;Just the facts maam...&quot;\n\nYo=\r\nu have to got by the spirits actions to tell what their demeanor is. Even t=\r\nhen, a spirit&#39;s action can be misunderstood. Say a spirit has just thrown a=\r\nn object in your direction. We may automatically think of that as an aggres=\r\nsive attack. But the spirit is probably just trying to get your attention i=\r\nn the most obvious way possible. It didn&#39;t throw the thing at you to hurt y=\r\nou.\n\nSee what I&#39;m saying? The only way you can really tell a spirits demean=\r\nor is by studying that same entity for a period of time to see what the nat=\r\nure of its actions are.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: James W.
