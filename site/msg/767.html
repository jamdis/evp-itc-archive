There's a lot of darkside interaction, and if you start getting a workable 
system up and running you get those voices that try to either scare you off, 
or distract you from the real stuff. The darkheads don't want this stuff to 
work, preferring humans stay in fear, and fear of death is the most powerful 
fear to have. The manipulations can be very subtle. I don't want to get 
distracted on other systems till I have a PCB made, and a production system 
out there.
I have an idea for a Spiricom like device using audio tones, instead of 
using radio as a sound source, I think I can adapt my system to it, using 
the random vlotage gnerator to sweep an audio VCO using the Intersil 8038 
chip. This voice was using a tone generator I had built into one of the 
receivers years ago, and mixed it with the radio noise.You can hear the 1000 
hz sqaurewave tone in the background.
