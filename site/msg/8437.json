I manage to be classic evps but no direct response messages or two way.   This gives me hope of accomplishing something more.  Question for Bruce, I am guessing your speed when playing and recording the evp session is around 90% no?  Also, are you using the Zcross or x fade features?  How about segments 80 plus or minus?   I have tried Stephans download of speaker jet vowels with wavemaker but can&#39;t pick out anything from the other side.  When I listen to your files, some messages pop out and others I listen to many times and still get nothing.  I am convinced it is my tin ear and the messages exist in your files.  Plan to put myself through a training program at this end to hear the messages...then maybe I can successfully get my own sessions going.  Thanks for your efforts.  And, I thank Stephan for sharing his\n files and knowledge.
