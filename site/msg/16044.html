This is why I tell everyone don't take my word for it try it for yourself. =
Communication with something beyond yourself is a personal endeavor. Stephe=
n Rorke makes his living on hoax news and to him this is news. I can't blam=
e anyone for questioning the reality around them. But I can take a look at =
what else a person has had to contribute to the world and the feild of stud=
y they claim to be in.=A0 I suggest you all do the same before you take som=
eones ideas and make them your own. He has a right to form his own opinion,=
 experiment and get his own results, and believe whatever he wishes. But so=
 do I.
=A0
Based on my own experiments, my own results, my own experiences,=
 I form=A0MY own opinions and beliefs. As for the spiricom communication de=
vice all I can say is its interesting but I was not there, I did not experi=
ement with it, I have no results with which to base an opinion on. All we h=
ave left is some recorded data, and heresay.
=A0
As for=A0Frank's box and S=
weep Tuning I can say I have seen the results, I have experimented with ST =
myself and I have received some astounding results which are message commun=
ications that are outside of my own knowledge and my own ability to control=
 or create. I have used many methods for EVP and ITC and have had many inte=
resting results that have been confirmed, recognized, and proved beyond a s=
hadow of=A0MY own doubt. This is=A0MY personal experience and I invite anyo=
ne who wishes to know more to try it for themselves and get their own resul=
ts rather than waste time trying to pick apart others ideas, theories or re=
sults. I never try and prove anything to anyone else because for each of us=
 it takes that one very personal experience to have that eye opening moment=
 and realize that there is more around us than what is apparent.
=A0
So no =
I am not offended by anything anyone has to say as long as they base thier =
statements on truth rather than BS. And we all know there are alot of peopl=
e who make their life revolve around the BS as well as try to profit from i=
t.
=A0
My best advice would be to try it in depth before you form an opinio=
n. Your results may differ from others, your personal experience may not be=
 the same but that is YOUR experience, not mine, to explore further.
=A0
My=
 journey has been quite fascinating, educational, and enlightening. I could=
 only hope that everyone else has a similar path, but we each have our own =
roads to travel.
