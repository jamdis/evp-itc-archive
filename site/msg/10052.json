This impression \nwas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; strengthened by the observation that the buzzing sound often \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; even \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modulated by O&#39;Neill&#39;s own voice during the dialoges between \n&gt; him \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and &quot;Dr. Mueller&quot;! (Did O&#39;Neill forget to remove the device \n&gt; from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; throat while talking to his counterpart?)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And what about the &quot;13 frequencies&quot; that are supposed to \nbe \n&gt; &gt; used \n&gt; &gt; &gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;carrier&quot; for the spirit voices? Why aren&#39;t they audible \nin \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recordings? And why does a mixture of the 13 tones created \nwith \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Audition sound so different from the typical &quot;Spiricom \nbuzz&quot;? - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if you analyze the frequency spectrum of the buzzing sound \n&gt; (this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be done with Audition etc.), you will find a lot of \nharmonics \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (peaks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the spectrum), and some of these harmonics more or less \n&gt; match \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 13 Spiricom frequencies...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To me, the entire Spiricom saga produces more questions \nthan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; answers...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- original Nachricht --------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Betreff: [EVP-ITC] Re: Spirico Device\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gesendet: Fr, 18.
