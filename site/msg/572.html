Hi Jaime
   
  I've never used the generators but I have heard alot of success stories involving them. I use a natural white noise when I record and get good results. The water from the fishtank is pumped thru a charcoal filter creating a waterfall effect and the running water has always been a benefit to my sessions.
   
  However when using background sounds like water or music I usually find its best to not blast the sound and to turn the recording mic down halfway 50% loudness so it doesnt drown out the voices. I also find that most of the material is located within the recording at a much slower speed. For mine the more audible voices are usually located at -74 percent slowed (if using audacity to slow it) and sometimes at -30 when they have alot to get across.
   
  So try adjusting the sound volume and the recording mic volume and see if that helps. And dont forget to try slowing it down and listening to it in forward and reverse.
   
  Good luck!
  Misty

          Hi,

I just entered the group and I'm interested in EVP. I have very 
little experience and would appreciate some help.

With my limited knowledge in electronics I built a white noise 
generator (with high frequency filtering) and I'm trying to use it to 
record voices with the PC/sound blaster. I did few attempts and so 
far I didn't found anything unusual. I'm not sure I'm doing 
everything right. The recorded sound is very noisy (as expected) and 
I'm not sure I would be able to detect any voice, even using headphones.

What sound sources produce best results? Does anyone have experience 
in using a white noise generator?
Does the sound have to be recorded in a analogical tape recorder or 
it can be recorded digitally?

Thank you,
Jaime
