<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting post, FS.  

I just like to think that everyone has their time and purpose.  You 
receive what you are to receive for a purpose.  Others receive what 
they are to receive, for a purpose. 

It will all wash out in the end, Purple Princess of the Seven.  :)

&gt; From; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_St_Germain &#x27;Saint 
Germain is always associated with the color violet, the jewel 
amethyst, and the Maltese cross rendered in violet (usually the iron 
cross style cross patee version); he is also regarded as the &#x27;Chohan 
of the Seventh Ray&#x27;[13]  according to Theosophy, the Seven Rays are 
seven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls and 
the unfolding of each 2,158 year long Astrological Age. Since 
according to Theosophy the next Astrological Age, the Age of 
Aquarius, will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray of 
Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called &#x27;The Hierarch of 
the Age of Aquarius&#x27;. According to the Ascended Master Teachings, 
Saint Germain is &#x27;The God of Freedom for the Earth&#x27;.&#x27;
&gt;  
&gt;  Much to do with the Purple Princess, and the seven. I don&#x27;t mean 
to sell others short, I just get a different level, and find 
regular &quot;this your auntie&quot; type EVPs kinda useless. Mostly I don&#x27;t 
post every voice I get, just the ones that I thought was outstanding, 
but no one else hears.
