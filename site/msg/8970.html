<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Laura.  There&#x27;s a patch cord available from radio shack for about $5.  You connect one 
end to the ear jack of the recorder and the other to the &#x27;sound in&#x27; on the computer.  I use 
a freeware program called Audacity to record.  Just play the file into the computer (rather 
than doing an actual transfer).  Hope this helps some.

&gt; Hi all, new comer Laura here.
&gt; 
&gt; I have an older version digital voice recorder.
&gt; Panasonic RR-QR 160.
&gt; I have used it for regular evp, but now want to listen to recordings on 
&gt; my computer...an hopefully post them to the group.
&gt; 
&gt; This model has no usb, only 2 plug in holes on top, headphones and mic.
&gt; Is there an adapter cord of a sort that I can get to run from the mic 
&gt; in the voice recorder to the mic in the computer and record? 
&gt; I&#x27;d really like to actually use it and post, etc.  
&gt; 
&gt; If there is not, or no one knows of an adapter, anyone know of a better 
&gt; voice recorder to get that is cheap!  lol
&gt; 
&gt; I am in the middle of hacking a 20-125, thanks to some help from Bruce, 
&gt; and I want to record and post what I get .....
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions anyone? 
&gt; ~ Laura
