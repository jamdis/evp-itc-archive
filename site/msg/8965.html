<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Lyn.  I&#x27;m somewhat skeptical about orbs, though I have to admit I&#x27;ve seen some that are 
puzzling on some way, or really beautiful and vibrant, or just seem to be &#x27;more than&#x27; dust. 

More recently my thought became this:  If those in spirit can manipulate the internal 
mechanisms of recorders, or sounds in the environment, in order to leave EVP, then why 
couldn&#x27;t they also have the ability to manipulate dust, or other environmental factors, in 
order to show themselves?  For some reason, this just makes sense to me.  :-)

&gt; wanted to share this article,  I notice whenever I get EVPs, there are always orbs around. 
&gt; anytime I find orbs in my pics, I get the recorder as I most likely will get an evp 
recording.

&gt; 
&gt; Hundreds of thousands of ordinary people around the globe are reporting
&gt; mysterious spheres of light known as ORBS, which have started appearing on their
&gt; digital photographs. A few scientists are taking this phenomenon seriously and
&gt; incredibly claim to have found evidence of beings from other dimensions..
