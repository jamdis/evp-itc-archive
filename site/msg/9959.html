William,
 
After the answer "I'm Good" where are the rest of the words com=
ing from.
And if they follow the answer "I'm Good" before you ask the next =
question, then most likely all the words that you were left with
after you =
cut out all the junk, even if it's twenty, are the answer they meant to sen=
d.
 
You want to concentrate on whatever words or phrases or messages come =
between your questions.
Also if the words have relevance to each other.
 
I=
f you cut out the garbage and a message like "I'M GOOO HOW ARE SINCE YOU FA=
RT TIME SAID THE"
Then yes your answer is probably "I'M GOOD" unless the sp=
irit is drunk!
 
if you cut out the garbage and you get a coherent meaningf=
ul sentence, message or answer to a direct question.
then that's what you w=
here meant to hear. minus the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 
See my point!=

My thoughts on cut out the garbage leads people to believe that =
the messages that some people are getting messages are all in one sentence.=

 
Example Question: How are you today?  
 
1st Answer:(Cut Up) I'm good, m=
e and my spirts friends here wants to give you a long message for the resea=
chers to here>  
 
2nd Answer:(Not Cut) I'm blah blah blah blah blah blah b=
lah blah blah blah blah good blah blah.
Does anybody see my point on cut up=
 messages?

Stefan, I do remove the "garbage" from my files. At this point in my r=
esearch, the message is more important to me than the proof of it.I think m=
ost of us here will agree that we are receiving some sort of paranormal com=
munication.but it definitely exists. now we need to concentrate on the mess=
ages they need us to hear and the answers to the questionswe ask and in tur=
n our answers to their questions. Anyone that cleans a file in this way sho=
uld not be touching any bit of the filethat has a semblance of speech, only=
 the bits that are odiously garbage like the "EH O EH AH O EH UR" in betwee=
n words. For example "Is there anyone here that wishes to communicate_YES_A=
H ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE"It is much easier for me as a =
researcher to be able to return to a file that I recieved two weeks ago and=
 that I believe may hold somerelivence to a message I just received and be =
able to cleanly listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds=
. At this stage in real time communication the messages are the top priorit=
y.I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained and made=
 available to individuals that make a request for any intelligent sceptical=
 or authenticity challenge that may be made, and god knows there are always=
 fanatical sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to attac=
k an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that our research files s=
hould be made available on request by every tom dick and harry that is unkn=
own to us and may potentiallydoctor the file to suit their own point and po=
st it as such. I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the re=
searcher that receives the request for raw research data should scrutinize =
the requesting source and use their best judgment before handing out any re=

Hi =
all,just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I woulds=
uggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, inorder t=
o rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can forinstance incr=
ease the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (includingthe experimenter's =
voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, butnot cut out individual =
pieces (supposed "garbage") to make an EVP matchwith what it "should be". A=
t least, the unedited version should alwaysbe provided along with the edite=
d version.But that's only my personal opinion which I thought I had to expr=
ess, aswe should always be able to present our results to a critical public=
.Stefan-- > Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these f=
