<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I just wanted to say that what I really find amazing with the make 
up of the box, that no matter what field your working in 
(paranormal, UFO&#x27;s etc.)is the fact that if a message needs to be 
delivered it will find a way of coming through to the right people 
to be delivered.  

I really believe that there is a hugh misconception that the box 
needs to be at specific location and will only recieve the messages 
pretaining to the history there, which is so not true.  

I know in on many occassions that a special message was to be 
delivered to certain people, especially in times of trouble and 
the &quot;greater powers that be&quot; have followed through alerting us, when 
the box was not in our possession, which is an example in RoseMary 
Ellen&#x27;s case. Knowing RoseMary Ellen personally, I can tell you that 
she has devoted much of her life to the paranormal and through her 
writings and teachings have been able to convey messages in many 
ways and her intentions are sincere.

I do have a theory on this, and is only my opinion.  

I have watched and observed the box on many occassions.  I have 
worked on many evp&#x27;s from the box, and for the most I understand 
much of what is coming through immediately. I have had one on one 
conversations many with the same voices and reconized them.  I see 
how many people claim it doesn&#x27;t work or they can not understand 
it.  Me however, truly believe that people whomn are &quot;pure&quot; with 
their intensions and their heart is in the right place with their 
research can fully understand and make a connect with the 
otherside.  The otherside know&#x27;s who they are and what they stand 
for and build a respect for them to carry on their work.  

I myself do not have a box at this moment, base on a respect issue 
for Frank and his work.  See, I truly believe that when you are 
suppose to acquire this tool of communication, the message will come 
through to let you know, and only then if your dedicated and 
passionate, should you be an advocate for the otherside.

 
These are just my thoughts.....
