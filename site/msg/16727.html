<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>People are what they are despite whatever education they have. I&#x27;ve known
and worked with people of all educational levels and the percentages of good
guys and jerks remains the same across the boards.

 Did you actually create a blog there, Frank?

&gt;  Since just questioning some of the box blogs out there results in insults,
&gt; cussing, and name calling, I wanted a place to respond quietly and sanely,
&gt; and also make general box use and function comments where people are not
&gt; going to be attacked, although I bet we can expect attacks via comments.
&gt; Like that one that&#x27;s all F-Us and name calling, yet is supposed to be from a
&gt; titled degree dork. Evidence that a &quot;higher&quot; education is more a process of
&gt; brainwashing than anythign else, and god help anyone that contradicts the
&gt; brainwashing. &quot;Thinking not allowed!&quot;. Also the group isn&#x27;t for this type of
&gt; comments. Sorry!
