<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sure. The best I can do is describe my experience, and that would be  
that since I was very very small, I always sensed that any living  
thing in the plant &amp; mineral kingdom had an energy to it. My mother  
divorced my father when I was a baby and remarried a European. His  
mother was FABULOUS and often talked of spirits, talking to her  
&quot;deceased&quot; mother and other relatives in her dreams, balls of light  
she&#x27;d often see (orbs I assume) and I loved it. I love cultures like  
the Irish, and all Celts, Cornish, and Welsh who include the spirits  
in their daily lives. I&#x27;ve always had a real passion for all things  
faerie and of nature and found Findhorn at a very young age. My first  
of 2 NDE&#x27;s was at age 5 and with that experience bloomed an intense  
interest in all spirits, not just those that had been in human form.

If you enjoy reading about Cayce, you&#x27;d love books by Dorthy MaClean  
&quot;To Hear the Angels Sing&quot; and Eileen Caddy&#x27;s books. You can find out  
more about them at www.findhorn.org In my early 20&#x27;s I was big into  
Caddy&#x27;s &amp; MaClean&#x27;s work and reading about Theosophy. I loved the  
works of Rudolph Steiner who was a visionary and founded Waldorf  
Education &amp; Anthroposophy. You&#x27;d probably love reading his stuff too.  
He delves deep into the angelic, elemental, and devic kingdoms. Really  
fascinating.

I&#x27;m so grateful for the chance to experience other cultures other than  
the US as they are much less &quot;puritanical&quot; and brainwashed by  
organized religions. I don&#x27;t mean to disrespect anyone by this  
statement, but people in the UK and other countries think we&#x27;re quite  
daft when it comes to thinking for ourselves, and forming our own  
opinions instead of being sheep to organized religions. I have to  
agree. Which is why I&#x27;m glad Spiritualism is growing in the US. Not  
fast enough though!

I continued my personal study of nature spirits or elementals over the  
years and to my amazement, one of my first recordings was of a being  
that said she was a faery. I do have a huge sense of humor, and though  
I was delighted, I just wasn&#x27;t sure I bought what she was telling me.  
lol! I think she said she was a &quot;house faery&quot; and she said she loved  
where she lived, etc... Some of those that claimed to be different  
types of nature spirits had different degrees of consciousness and  
intelligence. I found this really interesting. Some were quite wise  
and could have fabulous conversations and some could utter a word or  
two. Some could see and some could not. I had one spirit by my front  
door that would audibly greet people right in their ear as they were  
coming in. I always got a kick out of this and could tell by the look  
of shock, the wince, and looking around that they heard it, but were  
too freaked out to say anything. lol! Right by your ear she&#x27;d say &quot;Hi&quot;  
or &quot;Hello&quot;. Nothing else and she was always by the door. Go figure.

I type this out and then I think how silly it all sounds in type, but  
anyway, you asked! Hehehe!

I suggest reading the history of Findhorn on the website. It&#x27;s really  
amazing and they were able to grow things (and still are) in the  
Scottish sand there on the coast that were just impossible by  
cooperating with the nature spirits there. All sorts of scientists  
have come to study them and none could explain it. It simply shouldn&#x27;t  
have been possible. Eileen Caddy &amp; Dorthy McClean were the ones who  
made contact with the Elementals via meditation.

Oh it&#x27;s great stuff to read about and I think you&#x27;d enjoy it. What  
I&#x27;ve learned in my studies of these spirits is that all are equally  
important. None are to be higher or lower. No ego exists in the realm  
of God. All of them fill a task and should be respected. They love  
attention and loving thoughts. They&#x27;ve told me &quot;prayer is their  
medicine&quot;. Even spiders have personality... the tiniest flower can be  
such a joy. I once had a clam in my marine tank that loved to be  
petted. So much we ignore in our realm here in this country tossing it  
off because this culture has lost it&#x27;s ties to the old ways. So sad,  
but I digress... Another book you might like is &quot;The Secret Life of  
Plants&quot; by Peter Tompkins &amp; Christopher Bird.  The movie based on the  
book is here: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4753736638977368381

Anyway, I hope that&#x27;s of help!
