To me, they&#39;re rather like someone clearly holding the salt cellar in one hand and asking me, &quot;Which hand has the salt?&quot;\n\nIf it&#39;s a small child asking, that&#39;s amusing.  If it&#39;s an adult, it seems a bit insulting.  I don&#39;t expect the spirits to feel any differently.\n\nBut that&#39;s neither here nor there; the tests are not the issue.\n\nWhat is troublesome is the rhetoric chosen by RJ. While sarcasm rarely conveys well in text, RJ&#39;s posts are so dripping with sarcasm, the tone is impossible to overlook.  \n\nFurther, arguing over this seems a waste of everyone&#39;s time.  I doubt that anyone is going to change his or her mind. If this group&#39;s primary function is to swap insults rather than pool research results and brainstorm new approaches to this science, I should probably leave.\n\nSincerely,\nFiona Broome\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, April Abercrombie &lt;april@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; For the record, I appreciate RJ&#39;s contribution here, and what he is trying\n&gt; to accomplish with these tests. No one should have any problem not the\n&gt; skeptics, nor the believers. The outcome of the tests won&#39;t mean anything to\n&gt; anyone except those who wish to remain objective. I do not understand why\n&gt; some people here are so threatened by these tests.\n&gt;"}
