Mike,

I&#x27;m curious as to why the plastic enclosure.  I know on your video 
you mentioned both a shoebox or cigar box could be used as well.

I&#x27;m going to try this chamber experiment, but my question is what 
enclosure would be best so as not to inhibit the sounds, by the 
material of the enclosure actually absorbing any of the sound.

I&#x27;m no scientist by any means, so maybe my concern is mute, but it 
would seem to me that perhaps a glass (or lead crystal) or metal (tin 
box) enclosure would be an interesting experiment as well.

Also, have you given any thought to a single toggle/power up switch 
that would power all devices on at once, perhaps from outside of the 
box, thereby eliminating the need to open and close the box with each 
session.

What do you think?

thanks!

&gt; Hi Rita,
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome to the group.  Yes, Bruce is correct... my sound chamber 
design is an experiment to see how well that design works.  I took 
the basic components of a typical ghost box system and placed them 
into the plastic enclosure. But to hear what is desired does not 
always require a chamber. The chamber is just a place where the three 
sound components can mix and be captured by the microphone.
&gt; Just one of many different methods that can be used.
&gt; 
&gt; I have even got good results by just using a 12-470 and a recorder 
in the open air.
&gt; 
&gt; I did build a couple of new chamber systems and will probably build 
one more for a total of 4.  And I&#x27;ll probably provide some of those 
to some locals here to test. I&#x27;d like to get others input on this 
experimental design. LC is also putting one together using the 12-
469. So we will have data from that area too.
&gt; 
&gt; Again... welcome to the group.
&gt; 
&gt; - Mike

&gt; &gt; Hi Rita,
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; And welcome to the group I am always pleased to see new members 
and new interest in our research.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; You do not need anything extra to use the 12-469 you can use it 
with just the ear buds that are supplied with the radio.
&gt; &gt; If you like you can purchase an inexspensive fold up speaker from 
radio shack. It is 19.99 and works quite well.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; go to this page for a pic and description of the speaker

&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; The sound chamber that mike colleta has been developing is an 
experiment he is doing and is in no way necessary to
&gt; &gt; obtain good spirit communication with the RS box.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Please feel free to e-mail me with any questions you have, I will 
be glad to help. paranormalinvestigating@

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Rita, I think you will have to get a pair of amplified speakers 
on that 469, and put them in a sound chamber of some sort. In that 
chamber, you will want probably an amplified microphone running into 
your voice recorder, to pick up the sounds bouncing around in there. 
You can also add some white noise into the box, but I think people 
are getting results without adding the additional noise. The chamber 
seems to really bounce the sound around and give you a good mix to 
record.LC--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rita&quot; &lt;nvrenuf1031@&gt; 
wrote:&gt;&gt; Hi Everyone,&gt; &gt; New to group here. We just completed the 
advance hack on our 469 &gt; model. Are you supposed to hear the voices 
from the radio stations or &gt; just white noise?&gt; &gt; Also, is it best to 
hook up an external speaker, one or two, in order &gt; to record to a 
digital recorder? What is the best way to record, using &gt; digital 
recorder, or direct into PC using Sound recorder, and using a &gt; line 
in/line out connection?&gt; &gt; What is the recommended length of 
sessions. Should I try just a minute &gt; or two, or longer at one 
sitting?&gt; &gt; Thanks to all!&gt; Rita&gt;
