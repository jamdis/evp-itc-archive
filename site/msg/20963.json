For example, +12v on\npin 4 and -12v on pin 11. The input and output will show zero DC volts with\nno input, referenced to the power supply grounds.\n\nIf you put a (+) voltage on pin 4 and ground pin 11, the input and output\npins will reference to half that voltage. So if you put +12v on pin 4 and\nground pin 11 with a single power supply voltage, then the output will have\n6 volts on it and anything referenced to &quot;ground&quot; on a schematic must\nactually be referenced to 6 volts. You would have to use DC blocking\ncapacitors on the input and output to connect to other circuits.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Thu, Mar 3, 2011 at 9:42 AM, Luis &lt;luispucp098@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Well , I think you didnt understand me .
