William   I reposted the files...last on the list.   Possibly because the file is so large it was illiminated...but I wouldn't be surprised if it is part of the blockade...not that I'm paranoid.  Thanks for letting me know.  I will keep checking to see they don't disappear again.  RonL

I forward this for two reasons:  the first as a request from Bruce to determine recurring words and second because I wanted to have experienced ears hear my recording for comments.   Regarding the test, this is just 30 secs or so of a 7 minute recording.  Recorded at 90% using EVPmaker with xcross.  I was able to hear "art and arthor" a number of times within the 7 minutes.  This is after requesting no names be spoken.  
   
  Regarding my experiences with evpmaker and the allaphone file sent by Stefan, I must say my results have been underwhelming.  I hear nothing but evp gibberish.  I ask that anyone with an ear for this to give a listen and tell me if you hear anything intelligent.  I am in a terrible radio zone here in Mexico so I have high hopes on EVP maker and the file Stefan provided.  Also excited about the fact that so many others are getting excellent communications.  Thank you to anyone who takes the time to listen to and confirm my recordings.  I am beginning to feel like I am being blocked out like William had thought.  Maybe I am in a true dead zone, no pun intended, or "they" don't want me in the loop for some reason.  Ron L

To all that are experimenting with the EVPM allaphone file method.

I have done a few sessions with this method as I know a few other 
researchers have.
There have been a couple of researchers that have done sessions and 
gotten very similar responses such as the name "Arthur" and responses 
pertaining to "Air" also "I am here" or "here".

I have also gotten direct and intelligible answers to questions 
immediately following the question, and messages that could never be 
construed as random.

The test that I propose and the answer I seek is, The words that keep 
coming up to almost all researchers experimenting with this method IE 
the words I mentioned above.

I would like to find out whether these certain words are simply by 
products of everyone using the same file and come up as a result of 
the file playing in evpm, or are they true entity communication.

The only questionable content are these few words not all the methods 
communication. In my opinion the majority of the communication from 
this method is genuine.
The method has produced communication including my name to me as well 
as other researchers that have gotten my name, and some of the 
statements and responses show signs of a sense of humor that would 
surely be absent in random word grouping.

Who ever is involved with experimentation of this method, will you 
please on your next session ask that if there is a spirit named 
Arthur for him not to mention his name or the list of words that I 
have posted. I suggest that this request be made verbally before the 
session as well as after.

And in the most polite manner. They seem to respond better to 
formality.

please dedicate one session no shorter than 2 minutes to this 
experiment and post your results.

Your cooperation appreciated.

Bruce
