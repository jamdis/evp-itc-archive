Has anyone here ever used, or known someone who has used, a MEL-8704REM?
I=
 bought one recently, but have not had a chance to use it since I have
resi=
gned from the group I was investigating with. It was a little pricey
(for m=
e), and I'd like to know if it's worth keeping or should I sell it
and try =
one of these others that y'all are talking about? Thanks,

Jan
