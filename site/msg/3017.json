True most entities that are earthbound are o=\r\nnly partly conscious, in a dream state or their realities have become twist=\r\ned and delusional. \n\nYou don&#39;t see yourself as a &quot;ghost in a shell&quot; or bein=\r\ng primarily spiritual in makeup. You see yourself as physical because that =\r\nis the reality you are faced with at the moment.\n\nThe truth is Rod, a lot o=\r\nf us here (as ITC researcher and afterlife researchers) have built relation=\r\nships with counterpart teams on the other side. We do have primary contacts=\r\n who refer to themselves with names. Some of us even have recording groups =\r\nto help build this bridge to the other side.\n\nWhether you believe this or n=\r\not is of no consequence to me. If you wanna call people delusional, crazy o=\r\nr living in a fantasy world, that is fine to. But if you continue to do so =\r\nhere you may find yourself not being a part of this forum anymore because i=\r\nts counterproductive and negative.\n\nMany of us here have accepted the exist=\r\nence of the very things you poke fun at and we need no further proof. Do no=\r\nt make the mistake of thinking these are beliefs or ideas, acceptance is di=\r\nfferent.
