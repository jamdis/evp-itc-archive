Not to knock, Frank&#39;s Boxes or other Ghost \nBoxes!  Just a though! I may have an opportunity to get a $160. \nrefurbised Teac or Technics reel to reel tape recorder, but am \nwondering IF I should get it or not (it&#39;s a 1970&#39;s model appearently)! \nComments/ideas?  Thanks!   =Judy=   8-D"}
