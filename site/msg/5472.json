I grew up in the Spiritualist religion, so talking  \nto the dead was the major focus of our spirituality. All I&#39;m saying  \nis that for me, personally, I overcame the fear of negative entities  \na long time ago and have a very strong belief in my own strength and  \nthe love of my people on the other side to kick anyone&#39;s butt who  \nseems like they need it. :)\n\nAnn\n\n\nOn Jan 13, 2008, at 3:47 PM, bruce halliday wrote:\n\n&gt; Ann,\n&gt;\n&gt; I concede to your experience\n&gt;\n&gt; bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; From: lisby@...\n&gt; Date: Sun, 13 Jan 2008 11:59:10 -0500\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, I&#39;ve been talking to the dead in one form or another for 30  \n&gt; years. I&#39;ve never met a entity yet who could shake me up or effect  \n&gt; me personally in any way unless I let them. Not about to start now.  \n&gt; About the worst case I suffer is the creeps.\n&gt;\n&gt; I kind of expected to hear some of these entities cursing and to  \n&gt; have a few lost ones wander in. I live right across the street from  \n&gt; a cemetery.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Jan 13, 2008, at 11:21 AM, bruce halliday wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ann,\n&gt;\n&gt; The swearing you are referring to is caused by negative entities that\n&gt; are coming through the box.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are a couple of reasons why this occurs, If you do a session  \n&gt; when you are not in the correct frame of mind\n&gt; like being stressed out or having a disagreement with someone.  \n&gt; Anything that causes you to have anxiety will\n&gt; be a source of energy that empowers the negative entities and can  \n&gt; lead to deeper problems if not put in check.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another reason for negative communication is that your tech is not  \n&gt; capable of blocking them or you do not have\n&gt; a permanent tech assigned.\n&gt;\n&gt; My advice is to only do a session when you are in a somewhat decent  \n&gt; mood, Also doing  a\n&gt; protection prayer and asking your tech to block any negativity or  \n&gt; negative entity from communicating or coming\n&gt; through the box is a MUST.\n&gt;\n&gt; When you are doing a session do not take the continuous cursing  \n&gt; lightly, that is a sign that negative spirits\n&gt; are dominating the communication. Immediately shut the box and end  \n&gt; the session.\n&gt;\n&gt; Keep in mind that sometimes your tech will use a curse word to get  \n&gt; your attention when your mind wanders from the session\n&gt; to give validation that the communication you are receiving is not  \n&gt; just public radio chatter, in 99.9% of the incidents of\n&gt; your tech or any other benign spirit cursing usually they only use  \n&gt; one or two curse words tops.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is not an ongoing curse fest. Also after more experience you  \n&gt; will know by gut instinct what is negative.\n&gt; The main point is, do not take any negative communication lightly.  \n&gt; It is not a joke.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; From: lisby@...\n&gt; Date: Sat, 12 Jan 2008 23:41:10 -0500\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt;\n&gt; Mini box.\n&gt;\n&gt; This was just one snippet of one session.
