So I clip\nleaded to the big gel cells I use for testing in &quot;battery comparison&quot;, that\nsound good, so I stole the gel cell out of the Mini box, I&#39;ll go get a new\nbattery next week.\n\n I don&#39;t think the AA batteries are adaquate for most boxes, Think I&#39;ll\nhave to get some gel cells or NiMh batteries.\n\n In the one with the gel cell at 4 seconds &quot;niiiiice battery&quot;. Just a basic\nbox, no echo chamber.\n\n\nF-S\n\nA con e sion I did las yea , con e ed an old GE clock adio wi h mechanical uning o elec onic uning by eplacing he uning cap wi h a ac o diodes.
