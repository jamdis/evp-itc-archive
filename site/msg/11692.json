Actually, getting the flash as far away from the lens as possible\nplus either bouncing it off the ceiling or using a diffuser will\nalmost eliminate dust orbs. A speedlite flash is well worth the $$. \n\nTo make this a little more on topic, I have a 469 radio shack hack\nunit. I&#39;ve tried it a few times and haven&#39;t received any messages at\nall yet. I&#39;ve even tried just letting it run for a while while I&#39;m\ndoing other things and haven&#39;t gotten anything. I guess there isn&#39;t\nanyone around who wants to talk to me :( Do you know of anything I can\ndo to try to drum up some conversation?\n\nElabeth\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Elabeth,\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you found that using the diffuser helps to eliminate dust orbs?\n I&#39;ve \n&gt; been using the built-in flash on my D70S but think it&#39;s about time\nto get \n&gt; one of the Nikon speedlights to go with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt;"}
