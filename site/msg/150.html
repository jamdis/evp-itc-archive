Interesting investigation Jody. You captured alot of really good stuff. As for the owl...its a little paranormal omen of sorts if you look it up LOL
   
  The owl has had a long relationship with the dead and spirits. It has many folklores and tales dating back to ancient times. I see a few here now and then but usually smaller species. Florida used to have tons of them in all sizes but the landscape isnt as animal friendly as it once was.

  This was the tree that gave me bad vibes.  It appears to be some sort of animal in it. An Owl?  not really paranormal but cool!
   
  
   
  A huge orb.  It has a lot of texture.  I'm undecided about how I feel about orbs.  I know I can see them with my physical eyes, but there is so much that they could be.
   
  
   
  could be a bug.  But I'm leaning more toward nature spirit.
   
  
   
  another strange picture.
   
  
   
  same as above but with Gamma correction applied to lighten it.

      I agree.  I'm not one to go cemetaries.  And I did tell my contacts what I would be doing.  I get images of it being almost like an amusement park for them.  Where they can go to have some fun with the physical. 
   
  But the energy here was amazing! It didn't feel bad at all. The only part of the cemetary that gave me bad vibes was this old tree in the back. My husband said that by the way it looks it could have been a hanging tree.  They hung the criminals there and buried them in the woods.  So that was more of a psychic imprint from the past.

      HI Frank,
  I don't think they do naturally hang around graveyards.  I think they are there when we record or just let them know of our presence.  I know that Braden and friends come to talk just about wherever we are, and that includes the graveyard.  Bayview Cemetery is considered one of the most haunted in Washington state and is just down the road from me and Mary Jo.  Once we went into the mausoleum there, where it was pretty darn scary.  Neither of us got an EVP or an anomalous photo there, despite the strange vibes.  Vicki

          Here is two more.. LOL.. I need to motivate myself to make the web page. blahh

    

    Any way.  There was this one Grave that we believed was Elizabeths.  We went over there 3 times and could smell lilacs after awhile.  It wasn't immediate, it just slowly came upon us. There was nothing around us to create that odor (not even in the woods), so I'm guessing they were sending it to us. When I say "what are these" I was picking up some of those purple flowers that grow from clover.  They did not produce the scent we were smelling!! It was incredible.  I have experienced this before and to me, it means close to the same thing as roses.  A welcoming, of love and peace.
