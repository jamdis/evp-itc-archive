I changed the antenna with a piece of 20 guage wire from work \nand now the random seems to work really well, i really don&#39;t understand \nwhy.  This was my first session with the random on #27, let me know \nwhat you guys think.  I left it as raw of files i could.  There is a \ncouple up for interpretation that i&#39;m not really sure of and another \nthat says &quot;He wants to see if it&#39;s working&quot;.  I hear &quot;He wants to see&quot; \nvery clearly and i personally hear &quot;if it&#39;s working&quot;, but that may just \nbe my mind wanting to hear that.  I&#39;m only 2 min. in to this recording \nfrom this morning, but i have to get to work so i will post what i&#39;ve \ngot so far.\n\n-Steve H."}
