The sweep hung up, and put AM\n&gt;&gt; reception down below the band--I think. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s a weird feedback\n&gt;&gt; signal, as it was only audible in the echo chamber. Could it be an amazing\n&gt;&gt; example of spirit communication, naw, I think it much more mundane. It was\n&gt;&gt; after I put the top cover on, so my vote is feedback notes.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  This is not intended to reflect on any other systems out there, real or\n&gt;&gt; imagined, only my own work is in question.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nYeah, wei d how i wo ks.
