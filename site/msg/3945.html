<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s only one man&#x27;s opinion, but I assure you that sex or something

&gt; This is very clear.  I am amazed that even thought the audiable 
voice does not appear female, the spirit identifies its self by a 
female name.  Makes you wonder if there really is a sex on the other 
planes
