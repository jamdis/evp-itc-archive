&gt; I can&#x27;t produce boxes any longer, just do not have the resources. I was forced to retire early, the Ol&#x27; Lady&#x27;s pay was cut, as we both worked for school districts, net result, down about $3k a month. Yet, people wanted boxes--ultra cheap so they can auction them off for a huge profit. I can&#x27;t justfy charging several hundred bucks for a frikin&#x27; radio!  I won&#x27;t e-bay either, cuz the shit ain&#x27;t worth some dumbass paying 3-5-6 or more hundred bucks for, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to sleep at night. 
&gt;
&gt; It&#x27;s not research these people are doing, it&#x27;s called profiteering, not that that is wrong, under the right condidtions. Just don&#x27;t go blowing smoke up my ass about how great anyone&#x27;s reseach is. I&#x27;ve heard it all before, and mostly it&#x27;s a scam. In the US, everyone thinks to make a name for themsleves you have to cut someone else down. 
&gt;
&gt; Then people like your little friend demanding I make boxes to thier specs, and when I refuse--I&#x27;m the bad guy. So he attacks me publicly, so I get mad at everyone. I have had gut full over the last ten years.
&gt;
&gt; I think people paying/charging hundreds of $$$ for boxes just dumb, and it shows they have no clue how any of this stuff works. It&#x27;s a souce of raw audio--one source, you can do the same damn thing in many ways, but no, evereyone too busy chasing lime lights to be bothered with any real research. Granted not all, but like 99% 
&gt;
&gt; Yeah, I know--tell to my dogs, they have a better chance of to actually comprehend it.
&gt;
&gt; It&#x27;s like making a fine automobile, but everyone uses it as snow sled, then tells ya how fucked up your design is.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Excuse me? I attacked no one. I simply made a statement that what I make, I am not comparing to nor am I trying to copy or steal someones ideas I make a swiss army knife box that some people may want. If no one wants them then ill end up with a pile of plastic on my shelves in my home out of sight and that will be the end of that HOWEVER if someone does want to try my imperfect equipment to see if it will work for them Then I am happy to help them out with something that they may notÂ have been able to make on there on, and mainstream factories are not producing this stuff.
