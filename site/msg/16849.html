 [EVP-ITC] how to use?


    

   That's the thing, most don't realize, no =
matter how many times I say it, the box is nothing but a radio with swept t=
uning. The entities use the resulting bits of speech, music and noise to fo=
rm voices. "The Box" is not some kind of magic spirit communcation device, =
it just a radio, one method of many of supplying the raw audio that spirits=
 and other entiites can use to form voices. 

   You probably bought a "hac=
k" radio. many digital radios have a mute function to turn off  the sound w=
hile the radio sweeps, or searches for stations. If the mute function is ds=
iababled, then the audio is on while sweeping, and it acts exactly like my =
box. In the radio shack radios the mute wire/pin is marked making the hack =
easy and fast.  It's kinda nice form me since I can't mass produce this stu=
ff, and the hack boxes are cheaper by far, and do the same thing. 

   I do=
n't do investigations, or ask questions as is popular with the boxes, I jus=
t announce out loud that I'm doing an EVP recording, and record a few minut=
es, at home. 

   If your box is sweeping across different stations, it's p=
robably working ok, it just takes time to be able to hear "them" as they ta=
lk. Sometimes they use the bits of sounds to make voices, other times it's =
like they come in over the radio stations, and sometimes between stations. =
