I don't think its that Michelle. I think it is because a lot of us do this for different reason than you. I for one do not do this to prove a point or make this real to the world. Everyone will find that out sooner or later. I do this and other psi experimentation to expand my consciousness and to improve myself. The contacts and relationships I have built through ITC both on this side and the next are what I am interested in. So much of this research will never be proven because it takes so much personal involvement to make it work. It is not the equipment but the person who is making the connection and not one open minded skeptic, skeptic or close minded skeptic will accept personal accounts as proof.

That is what I take from Sumption's comments. It is pointless or spinning your wheels to fool yourself into believing people will accept what many of us already know.

Regards,

Frank R.

            Really??? Pointless? Is that the majority thought here, that it

doesn't matter? That there's no room for improvement? No need for

standards or protocols? 

The utter anger and refusal to post raw files concerns me and probably

a few others but, maybe not. My suggestions and questions are valid

and should at least be considered regardless of what you think about me. 

The whole "Babs has Issues" was a tongue in cheek title for the

thread, knowing what some of you think of me. I thought it was funny

but apparently not. It is clear that some of you will not get past

that and consider my observations. My sincere thanks to those of you

who are able to.

I do this and other psi experimentation to expand my consciousness and to improve myself. The contacts and relationships I have built through ITC both on this side and the next are what I am interested in. So much of this research will never be proven because it takes so much personal involvement to make it work. It is not the equipment but the person who is making the connection and not one open minded skeptic, skeptic or close minded skeptic will accept personal accounts as proof.<br><br>That
 is what I take from Sumption's comments. It is pointless or spinning your wheels to fool yourself into believing people will accept what many of us already know.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Frank R.<br><br><div style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; padding-left: 5px; font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;">----- Original Message ----<br>From: babiarz3 <babiarz3@...><br>To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com<br>Sent: Monday, January 21, 2008 1:19:10 PM<br>Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Babs has Issues!<br><br>








    <div id="ygrp-text">
            <p>Really??? Pointless? Is that the majority thought here, that it<br>
doesn't matter? That there's no room for improvement? No need for<br>
standards or protocols? <br>
The utter anger and refusal to post raw files concerns me and probably<br>
a few others but, maybe not. My suggestions and questions are valid<br>
and should at least be considered regardless of what you think about me. <br>
The whole "Babs has Issues" was a tongue in cheek title for the<br>
thread, knowing what some of you think of me. I thought it was funny<br>
but apparently not. It is clear that some of you will not get past<br>
that and consider my observations. My sincere thanks to those of you<br>
who are able to.<br>
