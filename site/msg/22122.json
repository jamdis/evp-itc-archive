I don&#39;t mean to offend, and  I am no engineer, and know someone can make this crap better. But after years of being insulted, belittled by skpetic and believers alike, I have reached a saturation point. I&#39;m not gonna take anymore.  Have someone saying I ripped off the idea-someone that has no clue about electronics, yet claiming I resisted his help-just beyond all my tolerance a patience.  \n\n I started this group, and by some accidental foresight gave owner ship to someone else, otherwise I would have deleted this thing. Endless arguements, and people seeking only to make a name for themselves off my work and the paranormal in general. Most get into this crap for ghost hunting, something I do not support as it is a focus on darkness and fear, nothing else. I think most--not all--hauntings are suggestion and Hollywood. No one wants to hear that, they want the fear, the negativity, and when I disagree, I am the evil bastard.  \n\n I didn&#39;t make boxes for some duffus to sit in the dark with yelling retarded questions at a radio--that&#39;s stupid! It was to hear from guides and other spirits, and find there is an afterlife. You can do that at home. Once again, everyone is gonna know better, after all you have to go the haunted hot spots cuz they have the portals--more pure BS. \n\n I think I should just withdraw from this insanity, I made this stuff for my own curiosity, and obviously, it does not apply to the real world. \n\n F-S"}
