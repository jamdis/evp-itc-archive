I am disabled from toxins I breathed\n&gt; at ground zero during rescue and recovery efforts, I was a first\n&gt; responder so we got the worst of it and it has left me with a lung\n&gt; disease and two heart attacks but I&#39;m not handicaped I have total\n&gt; mobility I just have to take it easy. So as you may see I have alot of\n&gt; time for experimenting and have been doing evp research as well as itc\n&gt; for some time now and your box has touched a special cord with me it\n&gt; just feels like I should have and be using one. Don&#39;t ask me to  \n&gt; explain\n&gt; it&#39;s just this wierd feeling like something is telling me you are  \n&gt; meant\n&gt; to use this tool. If you can ever see your way clear as to building  \n&gt; one\n&gt; for me I would be more than glad to pay for your time labor and\n&gt; materials and would be forever appreciative.\n&gt;\n&gt; your friend\n&gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
