It&#39;s that time again for me to remind you that the group \nis low on space (96% used) and actions will be taken. For now rather \nthan delete everyones files I am asking that you convert your wav \nformat into mp3 or smaller format before you post them to the files \narea.\n\nOne member using 10+ megs out of our groups 100 total megs just isnt \ngoing to fly anymore. So starting in May all files that are not \nwithin size limits and arent in smallest formats will have to start \nto get deleted.\n\nFor those who cant convert your files I have programs that are free \nto help you do that. For those that dont want to convert your files, \nyou can use esnips to post your larger files and share them with the \ngroup as links in posts. For those that ignore my posts and do what \nyou want to anyway, your stuff will be deleted and your option to \nupload and share here in group will be disabled.\n\nAs I said we have 100 (one hundred) megs total in file section for \nsharing, please do not abuse your share of that space. As you can see \nthere are others who like to share too. Eventually we may just clean \nit out of everyones files but for now lets try and stick to \ncompacting the things we upload and make use of places like esnips \nfor sharing.\n\nMisty"}
