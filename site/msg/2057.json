It sounds like two way conversation to me, \nalbeited limit here. I could hear some of this live, as some know, my \nhearing isn&#39;t the best. Chris&#39;s voice is muffled cuz #24 has a mic jack for \nthe operator, and I neglected to have a mic to plug in, so the echo box mic \nwas picking up Chris&#39;s voice.\n\nFrank-S\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nShare your special parenting moments! \nhttp://www.reallivemoms.com?ocid=TXT_TAGHM&loc=us\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_53d6_6442_5eed\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;6-(Chris)ThisIsReallyCooking-IsTylorHerewithUs---Ah-Huh-Hi----(Chris)-TylorHi-ThankYou-----HiChris.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n filename=&quot;6-(Chris)ThisIsReallyCooking-IsTylorHerewithUs---Ah-Huh-Hi----(Chris)-TylorHi-ThankYou-----HiChris.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_53d6_6442_5eed--"}
