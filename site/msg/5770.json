My group&#39;s name is SPIRIT Paranormal\n&gt; Investigation Team. I have been doing this in groups now for 6 years.\n&gt; I had my own group H.I.P.S. (Harrisburg Independent Paranormal\n&gt; Society) and now I am in the SPIRIT group out of Selinsgrove,PA. I\n&gt; also use to be with Kelly Weaver&#39;s group Capital Ghost Forum which is\n&gt; now called Spirit Society of PA. I had to leave her group because of\n&gt; my work schedule. I have been on Ghost Investigations with TAPS to\n&gt; Waverly Hills Sanatorium,Ky, Eastern State Pennitentiary in PA. I\n&gt; have\n&gt; also investigated St. Augustine Lighthouse in Fla. I did have a\n&gt; chance\n&gt; to meet Bill Murphy here in Gettysburg,PA. on the Battlefield near\n&gt; the\n&gt; Wheatfield last year for a short time. He is a nice guy. I let him\n&gt; listen to some of my EVP&#39;s from the Wheatfield and Triangular Field\n&gt; that day we met. I have been called an &quot; EVP Medium &quot; by my peers. I\n&gt; have a ton of them. I would like to thank &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; for his\n&gt; inspiring work with his boxes and giving of his time and knowledge to\n&gt; inspire us to do our own research to find the answers we are all\n&gt; looking for in this world. Thanks, Frank for your inspiration and\n&gt; hard\n&gt; work we all appreciate it. I would also like to thank &quot;Sum Duck&quot;\n&gt; and &quot;Mike Coletta&quot; for coming up with those Hacks that made it easy\n&gt; for me and all the others out there that are Electronically\n&gt; illiterate.\n&gt; Thank you guys we all appreciate it too. Oh well I just wanted to put\n&gt; my two cents in to let you know I&#39;m with you all. Oh, I have two 12-\n&gt; 469&#39;s the first one I broke trying to hack it LOL. The other one\n&gt; works\n&gt; great. I also have the 12-470(old model) which I tried to hack but I\n&gt; cut the wrong wire. I cut the green wire (seventh wire from the top\n&gt; as\n&gt; Mike said to do)and when I put everything back together I had no AM\n&gt; Band LOL. So I opened it up again and was thinking to myself should I\n&gt; cut the wire before the green one I had cut or should I cut the wire\n&gt; after the green one. Hmmmm, I thought here goes nothing so I cut the\n&gt; yellow wire after the green one number eight from the top. I put it\n&gt; together as I was crossing my fingers, I tried the FM band and bingo\n&gt; it worked great. Just a funny story of how electronically illiterate\n&gt; I\n&gt; am. I do want to say I do hear alot of voices coming across these\n&gt; boxes. I hear them saying their names and sometimes it sounds like\n&gt; they are talking to each other. I have gotten answers to questions\n&gt; too. Yesterday at my work place I like to listen to it while I&#39;m\n&gt; working here at the Post Office. I heard a male voice say to me &quot;Do\n&gt; you want a Tech ?&quot; I also hear the name Lisa alot and they\n&gt; say &quot;seven&quot;\n&gt; alot too. My name has been called alot too. So there has to be\n&gt; something to these boxes. Oh I also had one say &quot; Hurry dead battery &quot;\n&gt; which my batteries did die a few minutes later which was cool. I was\n&gt; recording with my voice recorder and picked that up. They say some\n&gt; funny things sometimes too. I did hear one say to me &quot; F__k Off &quot; I\n&gt; know that wasn&#39;t on any radio program LOl. Oh well you have a great\n&gt; set up here and it is nice to meet you all. Take care and keep up the\n&gt; great work you all are doing in your researches. Bye for now !!\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Ralph Smith of &quot;SPIRIT&quot; Paranormal Investigation Team !!!!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nHey Ralph!
