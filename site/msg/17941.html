Raymond Bayless was getting recorded spirit voices back in the 1950's.
Whil=
e his best known work was with von Salazy on audio tape, Bayless
also recei=
ved voices using an early grammophone-style recording device.
In other word=
s, he was using strictly a mechanical recorder. This would
suggest that the=
 voices may not require electronics at all. And that would
imply that radio=
 signals may have nothing to do with the voice reception.
=A0
Consider too =
that EVPMAKER sessions seem to work well for some people.
Except for the me=
chnical recordings, which are few in number, all the
current techniques hav=
e electronics in common. So it would make sense
that electronics=A0might be=
 important to the process. However, when 
you factor in the mechanical reco=
rdings made using devices prior to 
modern electronics, it seems more sensi=
ble to look for a common 
explanation which involves environmental manipula=
tion. The most reasonable
thing we know of that meets this criterion is min=
d-matter interaction,
or psychokinesis (PK).
=A0
The only remaining questio=
n then, aside from the actual source of the 
information which cannot be ob=
jectively ascertained as of yet, is whether
a single or multiple mechanisms=
 are indeed at work. Even though radio waves 
are not required to produce t=
he phenomena, if multiple mechanisms are at work, 
it may be=A0that radio w=
aves are one of many ways the phenomena is produced.
=A0
Bottom line, with =
so many options much more information is needed to form any
reasonable hypo=
thesis.
