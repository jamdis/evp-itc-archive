This spirit attached to my 23 year old\ndaughter in a very hostile and perverted way.  I have an evp I got in her\nroom...I had asked, &quot;Why are you here?&quot;  I got &quot; to f--k.&quot; in a very\ngutteral tone.  It was awful.  Thank God he is gone now and can never\nreturn.\n\nCarol B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; That sounds interesting, and Carol you said the spirit followed you home\n&gt; from Waverly... Thats cool, and I would try to get to know the\n&gt; energy/spirit.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Fri, 7/18/08, Carol B. &lt;cbreck@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Carol B. &lt;cbreck@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] blue lighting\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, July 18, 2008, 3:32 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Andrea,\n&gt; I have experienced this before. In my case it had to do with a spirit\n&gt; that attached itself to us while at Waverly. It became very strong, and I\n&gt; had to have assistance to rid my home of him. We also experienced very\n&gt; dense, black masses moving towards us.\n&gt;\n&gt; Carol B.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi Andrea,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a vortex may have been opening up in your hallway. Have you\n&gt;&gt; had\n&gt;&gt; any paranormal ativity in your house before?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jeff\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In a message dated 7/18/2008 2:27:28 A.M.

I am\n&gt;&gt; sorry\n&gt;&gt; I have not written before but I have a terrible year and haven&#39;t had the\n&gt;&gt; time to concentrate on EVP like I had prior. I won&#39;t get into the\n&gt;&gt; details\n&gt;&gt; but it\n&gt;&gt; has left me in the midst of OK just trying to pull through all of this\n&gt;&gt; BS\n&gt;&gt; &\n&gt;&gt; I will get back to it when I can.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Unfortunatley I am leaving for the weekend tomorrow morning and won&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; see\n&gt;&gt; my\n&gt;&gt; e-mails until Monday morning.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have a question for any one here. I believe in aliens, spirit and\n&gt;&gt; ghost\n&gt;&gt; communications via evp but tonight I had an experience I never had\n&gt;&gt; before.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I woke up at exactly 2:22 by my stove&#39;s clock and went and cleaned my\n&gt;&gt; sink\n&gt;&gt; of dishes while I heated up some cream chipped beef (albiet not too\n&gt;&gt; exciting)\n&gt;&gt; but while I sat there after in the dark with my family sleeping my\n&gt;&gt; hallway\n&gt;&gt; ilummating a light clored blue several times. Anyone else ever seen\n&gt;&gt; this?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I look forward to any responses.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks!\n&gt;&gt; Andrea\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ************ **Get fantasy football with free live scoring.
