Nothing \nwrong with that, as being allowed to experiment, be creative, and \nthink out of the &quot;box&quot; is of great value, IMHO.\n\nThe issues with any of this is that again, people will demand to have \ntheir own paranormal/spiritual experiences as &quot;proof.&quot;  Yet, we \ncannot prove it to anyone, as the &quot;evidence&quot; will never be good \nenough.  I would rather focus (as I am lead to work with said \ndevices) on how I believe it is to be used by me.  Therefore I allow \neveryone else the grace to work with these however they deem.  \n\nI think there is value in being able to share our ideas, triumphs, \nfailures, etc.  That is how results will improve, by bouncing ideas, \ntrying new things and working together.  If rule and law are put in \nplace for everyone, then we limit creativity which is needed to \novercome obstacles through invention.  \n\nThere will always be skeptics and critics, but one thing seems \ncertain: everyone has their own time when they become open to the \npossibility of the paranormal/spiritual existing.  I just choose to \nshare with those whose time has come.  :)\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; William--\n&gt; \n&gt; I have gotten some very long sequences and have posted them, as \nthey  \n&gt; were given to me. I do not clip anything out. My messages come  \n&gt; through very, very quickly, so I do slow them and often amplify \nthe  \n&gt; sequence. So, long sequences are indeed possible and do happen. I  \n&gt; just want you to know that is the case.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; On Apr 18, 2008, at 10:41 AM, Wiliam Clarke wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bruce,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My only problem with this is when I did started Box research 2 \n1/2  \n&gt; &gt; - 3 Months ago.  From ghost box research (not sound soap, or  \n&gt; &gt; EVPmaker) I saw alot of messages/files posted  that were 4-10 \nwords  \n&gt; &gt; long, and you and others were bragging on how long of a message  \n&gt; &gt; y&#39;all had, and that nobody else could get messages that long.  \nThat  \n&gt; &gt; is were I feel that I have been mislead.  I didn&#39;t know that \nthose  \n&gt; &gt; files/messages had the garbage cut out of it.  I actually \nthought  \n&gt; &gt; y&#39;all got messages that long from the radio/Franks Box.  I was  \n&gt; &gt; trying to get communication like that,  and wondered why I  \n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t.  I do know now that it is physically possible to get \nthat  \n&gt; &gt; type of communication after I lost my session 22, but it doesn&#39;t  \n&gt; &gt; happen like that every time.  I mean no disrespect about this  \n&gt; &gt; situation.  Also I don&#39;t see myself as a &quot;Newbie&quot; anymore.  If \nyou  \n&gt; &gt; want to go by ranks, I would like to be refer ed as a &quot;amateur \nbox  \n&gt; &gt; researcher&quot;.  If you have anything else to say, I think it needs \nto  \n&gt; &gt; be taken care of in private emails.

Anyone that  \n&gt; &gt; cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the \nfile\n&gt; &gt; that has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously  \n&gt; &gt; garbage like the &quot;EH O EH AH O EH UR&quot; in between words.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For example &quot;Is there anyone here that wishes to \ncommunicate_YES_AH  \n&gt; &gt; ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE&quot;\n&gt; &gt; It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return to \na  \n&gt; &gt; file that I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold \nsome\n&gt; &gt; relivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly  \n&gt; &gt; listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At this stage in real time communication the messages are the \ntop  \n&gt; &gt; priority.\n&gt; &gt; I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained  \n&gt; &gt; and made available to individuals that make a request\n&gt; &gt; for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may \nbe  \n&gt; &gt; made, and god knows there are always fanatical\n&gt; &gt; sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to \nattack  \n&gt; &gt; an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that\n&gt; &gt; our research files should be made available on request by every \ntom  \n&gt; &gt; dick and harry that is unknown to us and may potentially\n&gt; &gt; doctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the  \n&gt; &gt; researcher that receives the request for raw research data should\n&gt; &gt; scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment \nbefore  \n&gt; &gt; handing out any research data.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; From: yahoogroups@...\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2008 09:55:42 +0200\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I \nwould\n&gt; &gt; suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a \nwhole, in\n&gt; &gt; order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can \nfor\n&gt; &gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip \n(including\n&gt; &gt; the experimenter&#39;s voice), filter or denoise it to make it \nclearer,  \n&gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an \nEVP  \n&gt; &gt; match\n&gt; &gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should \nalways\n&gt; &gt; be provided along with the edited version.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But that&#39;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to  \n&gt; &gt; express, as\n&gt; &gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical \npublic.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Stefan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these \nfiles.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the \nmessage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise \nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can&#39;t piece \nthese\n&gt; &gt; &gt; files together to make something it&#39;s not, so i keep them in \ntrue\n&gt; &gt; &gt; form pretty much to the original.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Steve\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hey Steve Forgot to ask...how much editing was needed to get \nthis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; file?
