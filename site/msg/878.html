<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>for almost ten years, i  snatched spare time here and there to look 
closer at one megahertz/1khz phenomenon. well that dave is in 
milwaukee; in 1983 i was able to get strange otherworldly pics on vhf 
and uhf due to signals from milwaukee going out into weather 
weirdness over lake michigan and redirected to chicago area.  this is 
rare but very well known phenomenon to hams and tv/dx nuts in the 
area.  now it takes on another &quot;dimension&quot;.  to make headway you have 
to outdo science establishment ON THEIR OWN TURF.  thats where all 
the control is; upstarts are simply put out of existence by policy or 
legislative adjustments and reality be damned.  you cant run and you 
cant hide; the only way out is to grind ahead.

by far the most critical aspect of the one meg phenom is that , as 
you manually scan, SOMETHING  builds up until voices bleed over into 
detectability; if you scan too far, &quot;keep alive&quot; scalar or tesla 
or &quot;other&quot; current is spilled back into to vacuum and you have to 
start over.  once tuning is established, it locks itself in and only 
way to stop performance is to remove power source--and occasionally 
even that doesnt work.

one meg phenom repeats at 100khz, 100mhz, 1000mhz, 9-10000mhz but is 
strongest at one mhz and is related to weather and ALSO(seemingly) 
AFFECTS WEATHER.  effect is not sharply notched at one mhz and 
extends from about 800-1200 khz and power spectrum has sharp peaks at 
skirts, fall-off is perfect vertical.

at 100mhz am and 1ghz (blocked cell phones,uhf tv) , effect can be 
externally swept by a phase coherent signal from space which 
sometimes locks on.  a multi element yagi  pointed south quickly 
solves that mystery; it&#x27;s jupiter, our mini-sun; it&#x27;s so huge and 
close that its electrical activities &quot;condition&quot; our local, sub-
quantic medium-ESPECIALLY when jupiter passes between earth and the 
galactic core, as it is doing RIGHT NOW.

this is only introductory; theres way more, more than most people 
would ever want to know about, though. thats why im only highlighting 
key points to be aware of.

&gt; WOW!! I am amazed that someonme actually tried this! It does work. 
There was 
&gt; a Danish(I think) researcher doing the same thing, but never could 
make 
&gt; contact with them. I have done this myself, and it can work wiht TV 
too, if 
&gt; you can switch channels fast ennough. I think you could use a 
steeper motor 
&gt; controler to randomly turn a stepper moter, to turn the dial. 
Manually 
&gt; spinning the dial has one advantage, the sound is clearer! I have 
yet to see 
&gt; a method of ITC that produces better results that the random tuning 
methods.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning 
system. I tried 
&gt; &gt;several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner through the 
AM band 
&gt; &gt;late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the dial moving at a 
constant 
&gt; &gt;rate of speed. This is not nearly as good as Frank&#x27;s &#x27;hands off&#x27; 
random 
&gt; &gt;tuning method but it still produced some results. What impressed 
me most is 
&gt; &gt;that some of the voices sound the same, even though I tuned 
through several 
&gt; &gt;channels. This attached capture could be a technical message.
&gt; &gt;&quot;Plug a million hertz&quot;   One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which 
is close 
&gt; &gt;the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.
