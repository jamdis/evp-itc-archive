 Maybe I should re-phrase that. You almost certainly have to use somekind =
of technology to get the voices, but I think it's technology independent in=
 that they can use just about any method. 
 It makes me wonder about the va=
lue of the boxes, since many times, maybe most of the time, I can get clear=
er, and more coherent voices with DRV, direct radio voice---the manual tuni=
ng method. It takes minutes to do a quickie session, not even paying attent=
ion to what's coming across, as long as it's being recorded. No echo box, a=
nd no finicky random voltage generator.  I wonder if my non-reverant attitu=
de has anythng to do with it. I don't appoach this as if it's mystical, mag=
ical, religous or mysterious. I accept it as an axiom (without proof/not pr=
ovable). I don't ask questions, and welcome everyone, and everything to spe=
ak. 
 
 I think my boxes give the false impression that you need somekind o=
f exotic technolgy, and that I can say without a doubt is not the case. I h=
ave said that for years! It's more dependednt on an open mind and lack of f=
ear than anything else.
