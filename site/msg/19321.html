Frank, 
=C2=A0
Please don't. 
=C2=A0
I know that you probably hear it all t=
he time (I hope you do, at least) and that it's hard to stomach...but your =
work=C2=A0IS great, it has immense value, helped transform an entire field =
of research and opened up the doors wide to future experimentation, expandi=
ng knowledge=C2=A0and various=C2=A0personal (psycho-spiritual-technological=
)=C2=A0advances. 
=C2=A0
Your continued questioning is a good thing and I c=
ertainly applaud your efforts used=C2=A0to gain a deeper understanding into=
 what we do, how it works and just what the hell is going on here. 
=C2=A0
=
It's my personal feeling that "psychic-prop" is a spot on term for such thi=
ngs. In reality, I believe most who conduct GBC can/could communicate witho=
ut such devices. It becomes a matter of training, experience and preference=
. Working with the GB has allowed my own intuitive, clairvoyant, clairaudie=
nt and clairsentient gifts to become more fully developed and that's not to=
 mention=C2=A0the immense joy I and others have=C2=A0gained through this wo=
rk and it=C2=A0is, in a very large way,=C2=A0because of YOU my friend. 
=C2=
=A0
I've been feeling more and more lately that GBC does indeed happen, for=
 the most part, in the user's brain. I believe that our unconscious self an=
d subconscious mind has things it wishes to communicate to us at a consciou=
s level. 
=C2=A0
With the box we get a never-ending supply of raw audio tha=
t our minds can use to "realize" (perceive) things that only makes sense to=
 us, the individual operating the device and GB sessions. I think that what=
 we find, hear and become receptive to during our sessions...all that we "p=
ick out" of a recording are things the unconscious self wishes to make know=
n to the conscious self. 
=C2=A0
The audio matrixing principle, phonologica=
l ambiguities and auditory un-clarities resulting doesn't take anything awa=
y from the information and messages which come through. We hear the parts, =
pieces and patterns that we're supposed to. The voices, messages and inform=
ation that each of us is drawn to is, in some way, exactly what the subcons=
cious mind wishes to communicate to us and we hear it just as we're suppose=
d to. 
=C2=A0
Some people might perceive these messages=C2=A0as originating=
=C2=A0from spirit or ET's or "The Great Field"...whatever it is and by whic=
hever name seems to "fit" and make the most sense to the individual. 
=C2=
=A0
I think in many ways that we are ALL right!
=C2=A0
If all there is IS "=
mind", thought, consciousness, light, energy and endless fields of pure inf=
ormation...if everything is connected by one quantum field, one Source of e=
nergy and one point of origin (The Big Bang, Intelligent Design, Divine Hap=
penstance, a total fluke=C2=A0or whatever the case may be!) then I'm far le=
d to believe that our minds are connected to ALL of it and will continue to=
 use whatever methods, mediums and forms are at our disposal to assist with=
 that communication. 
=C2=A0
What you've said here doesn't invalidate anyth=
ing for me, personally. If anything your insights and frustrations make it =
more relevant...I just wish it wasn't all so taxing on you, Frank.
