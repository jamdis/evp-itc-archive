We know better than to believe anything they say one way or the \n&gt; other, but we do recognize that this is excellent proof of intelligent \n&gt; communication... how often do you scan the dial and get like five or six &quot;no&quot;&#39;s \n&gt; this close together?\n&gt; \n&gt; See &quot;reincar-no&quot; file in my folder &quot;Adriana&#39;s files&quot; in the files section.\n&gt;"}
