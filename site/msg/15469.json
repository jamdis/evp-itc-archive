They were asking for you, this was a few  days \nago, over my radio the RS 20-125 they sound very clear to me, didn&#39;t say  \nwhat they wanted maybe I can go through the recording, and see what else they  \nare saying.  They like to watch baseball sometimes on my big screen, had a  \nwhole group of them here last weekend, for fun I asked them where they were \nin  the house, they said &quot;all around&quot; and &quot;4 are sitting on the floor,&quot;  I  \nsaid, well I must walk right through you people then, they said &quot;yes&quot; I \nasked  them if they felt any sensation, they said they do feel when we walk \nthrough  them.  I always ask them if they want football or baseball, they say  \n&quot;baseball&quot;  I had one spirit fella here routing for Seattle, it was  the \nTigers _Mariners  game, since I&#39;m not much into sports, I wasn&#39;t really  sure if \nit was a rerun or not, but they seemed to be happy, when I went into my  \nroom to work, I could hear them in the front room chatting amongst  \nthemselves.  Sometimes it&#39;s neat to have company out here, and I don&#39;t even  have to \nfeed them.  Would you know anything about who the fella is in the  second \none?  He is saying &quot;save a company.&quot;\nBonnie\n**************An Excellent Credit Score is 750.
