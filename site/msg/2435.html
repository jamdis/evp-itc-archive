<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Here&#x27;s what i got:

1.  &quot;You are the one to prove that ghost would talk&quot;
2.  &quot;Found out, male dog&quot;...(rest i think was radio and said 50% off)
3.  I actually heard that file exactly the same way you said it was.
4.  Heard same as you.

&gt; I was checking out a little boom box here, and decided to do a 
quickie session using manual sweep of the AM band. This is at work
(don&#x27;t tell the boss!). 
&gt;  
&gt; The one about the male dog might refer to the mate to this female 
poodle we have now. For those unfamilar, our daughter in-law knows 
someone that rescues dogs, and she was tryuing to get rid of some of 
her too many animals. The daughter in-law at first gave us the male 
poodle a few weeks ago, but he was deaf, blind, and someone, 
probably the puppy mill he came from, pulled all his teeth. He was 
too much to deal with, he fell down our stairs twice, and we felt he 
was suffereing too much, so we took him to the Dumb Friends League. 
Now we have his mate, but she has most of her teeth, and can hear, 
see and is a little sweetie. #4 is hopefully accurate.
