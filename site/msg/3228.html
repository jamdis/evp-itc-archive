<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello all,



This is just a note to let you know that the AA-EVP in now on You  
Tube at http://youtube.com/aaevp.  There are two videos (part 1 and  
2) with testimonials from a few members of the Big Circle, including  
examples. We think they offer hope to all of us that our loved ones  
are okay on the other side. Please consider including the link in  
your website and sharing it with friends.



There is also a banner with an embedded link at http://aaevp.com,  
which you can copy and paste into emails on your website.



We know that many of you who are receiving important contacts from  
loved ones are not in the video. Those who are were at the last  
conference and Lisa Huston, the producer of the video, had  
interviewed them.



We apologize if you have heard from us about the new video via other  
emails. We are trying to make sure everyone knows about them.



Tom and Lisa Butler
