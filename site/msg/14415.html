Frank do you think it's similar to what was used in 20's and 30's by  
mediums, where a trumpet (long piece of aluminum metal cone light  weight shaped 
device) was used, it was a form spirit to form their own  vocal cords in mid 
air.  Perhaps, you should set up a test, try asking  something of the 
spirit that you do not know, where it could be verified later,  that way it won't 
have any physical influence.  I remember voices easily,  it's the work I 
do, so I do recognize my mother's voice, I do think you are all  onto some 
thing here, which should one day be as the air plane, who every  thought humans 
would one day fly?  Try some light weight metal object in  the box, maybe 
it would help, maybe shaped like a pair of vocal cords, with  folds see it 
that helps. sf

I make the boxes and I don't know, it seems to be a natural  ability that 
most spirits have. Thoughts can interact with the electronics,  and even 
"voices" of the living can come through, in that way I think we can  create what 
we are expecting to hear. 
 
 When I first started making this stuff, I gort my wifes "voice" as  she 
was stepping in the shower, upstairs, "I'll be out in two minutes", in her  
voces, throught he box. It's seems to be more difficult to conciously form  
voices, kinda like doing PK, it's more of a subconcious function. Of course  
that was with the radnom sweep, linear sweep seems to work a little  
differently, and seems to take more ability, or effort. 
 
 The voices seem to made inside the electronics, you can record with  no 
sound output, and still get the same kind of results. Even that could  support 
that suggestion that it's imagination, in that we'd still hear the  same 
stuff in the chopped up audio, not that I believe that. 
 
 Someone needs to study this stuff that hasn't already made up their  minds 
what it is.

Hi, I have a question for those who use a box instead of radio, where  do 
spirit get the ability to talk with a box?  Are there certain  channels going 
by with the box as is like a radio? sf
