<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I would like to propose a subject for some research sessions.
It involves Identical twins and the spiritual and mental connection 
that they share.

The way identical twins are conceived is when the egg enters the womb 
for some reason it splits into two separate eggs. The resulting two 
fetuses develop independently of each other, but carry the same 
genetic
code and identical DNA. they are in essence clones of each other.

some cases of identical twins that where separated at birth for 
whatever reason, and then have been reunited later in life find that 
they have developed similar if not identical traits and habits, such 
as an interest in art or the same music or literature. They also 
share common memory patterns that are impossible to develop other 
than through some sort of telekinetic link. Being separated at birth 
they could not have experienced any joint memories. There have even 
been cases where one twin will become gravelly ill pr have a serious 
accident and the other will to a certain extent feel the pain and 
suffering of the other twin.


This raises a few questions that might be a good research subject for 
us to pursue.

Is the relationship that we build with our technician/guides similar 
in content as the subconsious or spiritual bond between twins?

When the egg separates in the womb do the individual twins share a 
single spirit or soul?

Does the soul get divided as well to serve both individuals in the 
physical and then reunite as one entity after death.

Most likely one twin will die before the other, when the second twin 
passes is the spirit of the second twin absorbed into the first and 
vice verse?

Does each twin receive it&#x27;s own unique spirit and if so does the 
spiritual energy remain identical the same as the twins DNA and 
physical characteristics?

These are just a few of the possibilities we could explore with this 
subject.

If anyone is interested please contact me so we can discuss it.
