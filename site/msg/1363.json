I&#39;m adding  mic amps and speaker drivers \nto the blank portion of the board, which will be pretty crowded. I&#39;m hoping \nto have a board layout done within a week, and get at least this much in \n(limited) production, since the sweep generators are relatively simple. The \nchip is the LA1816, and is a pain to work with since it&#39;s a shrink dip 24 \npackage, the pins don&#39;t fit any boards, or sockets, so it almost has to be \non a printed board. I used #30 wire-wrap wire to connect to the chip, after \ncutting slots in the perf board to allow the pins to protrude through. My \nfirst attempt with this chip, I made a socket for it, but couldn&#39;t get the \nchip to work. Other than the weird pin spacing the chip is pretty easy to \nwork with, but you have to watch the grounds, the RF ground is DC isolated \nfrom the chasis, or DC  return. Then because I&#39;m using an RF amp for AM \ninstead of a bar antenna, I had to add the choke between the antenna input, \nand RF ground. The data sheet showed a 39mh choke, which would have been \nimpossibley large, so I used a 2 mh, and it works ok. There always seems to \nbe these little &quot;mistakes&quot; on the data sheets. With the LA1135, there is a \nresistor on the data sheet that is ten times to large, which keeps the chip \nfrom working at all if you use the value on the data sheet. That was the AM \nonly chip I used for a recent proto type.\n\nGuess that&#39;s enough techno drivel!\n\n\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nPicture this ï¿½ share your photos and you could win big!  \nhttp://www.GETREALPhotoContest.com?ocid=TXT_TAGHM&loc=us\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_699c_5ceb_3f4b\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;AM-FM-board.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;AM-FM-board.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_699c_5ceb_3f4b--"}
