On the low tech end, I wonder if justusing humming as a base would give the spirits the energy andfrequencies they need to form the sounds of language. I will play withthis and let you know if that pans out.\n\nIf this worked, we would be a big step further, since it would be very easy to seperate the humming from the voice afterwards, leaving the undistorted EVP. But unfortunately, experience teaches us that it&#39;s not sufficient to provide a uniform signal as a base; the sound source has to vary aperiodically, it works best with a speech-like signal. This - among other observations - lead me to the conclusion that EVP is not a question of energy but rather a question of information.\n\nBut this is only my personal interpretation; other experimenters may have different experiences. So please ignore this and try using humming! :-)\n\nStefan"}
