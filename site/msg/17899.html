<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>TRF=tuned radio frequency. The kind of radio that was in use when radio was
first invented. There is a modern chip version, it has three pins and is
very simple to set up. TRF has the advantage of less noise and static, but
in a box the stations tend to over lap, but it still can give good results.
It&#x27;s the same radio in earlier version of the Mini box, and Chapple also
used it in one of his projects. I have found it&#x27;s best to wind the coil and
tweak it to the radio by removing tunrs until it covers the AM band. I start
with 70 turns of wire, the remove five at a time--or you could just wind
sixty turns and leave it at that, but being anal I tend to over do it.

 At 3 seconds &quot;April, that gorgeous (capsule)&quot;, at 6 seconds &quot;break it up&quot;,
and 11 seconds &quot;that woman-talk to Hultay&quot;.
