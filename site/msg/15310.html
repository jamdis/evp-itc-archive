<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I would be interested in having some of the items created by Mike Coletta (www.ufogeek.com) built. He gives full permission for anyone to re-create  his prototypes and I would I be happy to if I was not so tech-backwards. Thanks. Robb

&gt; &gt; Hello all! I just wanted to say hello to everyone in the group, and introduce myself. I have been active in paranormal investigation for some time. I was hoping to find someone to help me with building existing products (labor and cost paid by me) for paranormal investigation. I was sent in this direction by Mike Coletta who spoke highly of the skills and kindness of the members of this group. I look forward to hearing from some of those tech-savvy individuals that I envy! =) Thanks in advance, Robb Demarest
