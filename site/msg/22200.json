I think some forget that you can argue theory and\n&gt; ideas,  but not be personal or petty. We can be civil and friends the end\n&gt; of the day, we may agree to disagree about topics, but the proof is in the\n&gt; data,isn&#39;t it? Frank is a really nice guy and I have always been treated\n&gt; well by him, learned from him and respect his work. He has put in tireless\n&gt; amounts of time and effort into his boxes and has always welcomed ideas and\n&gt; discussion on anything he has posted. Can we go back to the scope of this\n&gt; group and leave the drama at the door?\n&gt; \n&gt; Pete Haviland\n&gt;"}
