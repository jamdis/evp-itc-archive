It &quot;could&quot; be anything but the probability is that it is  \n&gt; only\n&gt; certain things. It is most likely NOT someone with a radio or other\n&gt; electronic device fooling with you.\n&gt;\n&gt; Zack\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, 18 Aug 2008, black bear hollow wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; What difference would a recording make?

There are spirits who have  \n&gt; never been\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; incarnated into human form. They tend not to be involved in any  \n&gt; way with\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; lower forms of vibration.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Edgar Cayce spoke of them. Their souls were created as the  \n&gt; moment of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Creation. They chose not to have ever incarnated. Since their  \n&gt; vibration\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; level is far more than a lowly entity, I highly doubt that they  \n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; interact with lower entities. They are on a completely different  \n&gt; level of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; existence.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Al\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; -- black bear hollow &lt;blackbearhollow@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I just said that in reference to Al&#39;s comments.
