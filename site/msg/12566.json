Don&#39;t you wish \nyou could have taken your ghost box out there with you, but were afraid \nit would get all wet and ruin the sensitive electronic circuitry?\nWell... worry no more. Now you can take ghost box functionality with \nyou when you&#39;re all wet, or at least the environment you&#39;re in is all \nwet. Now you can listen to those ghosts, singing in the shower.. :-)\n\nHere&#39;s a video that shows you how to make a waterprroof SONY ICF-S79V \ninto a ghost box with non-stop sweeping audio.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSjEug601Q\n\n- Mike Coletta (UFO Geek)\nhttp://www.ufomagazine.net"}
