<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting, Mike.  

I am wondering how it will work...nothing seems to make sense to me 
with any of this, but somehow we are getting responses. LOL  

Yesterday, I thought of your little Listen Up! audio amplifier with the 
Y adapter, headphones and the recorder as an EVP recorder set-up for 
real time audio EVP on investigations.  My plan is to suit-up one of my 
EVP specialists and test in the field within the next couple weeks.  
Perhaps, they might be able to hear the replies as it is being 
recorded, so they can then ask questions.  Interestingly enough, I just 
received an EVP over top of my ghost box sweeping audio on Friday.  
Weird. However, I did not envision the chamber with &quot;prongs&quot;(?) like 
you built, though.  

LOL  Can&#x27;t wait to hear about your results.

&gt; You know me and my weird devices... yes I&#x27;ve built another.
&gt; This one came to me in a dream last night.  I think it was because 
some 
&gt; of you guys were talking about echo chambers.
&gt; Anyway... when I woke up I went looking around the house for stuff to 
&gt; make this thing before I forgot what it looked like in my dream.
&gt; I completed it but now I guess I must test it to see if it is what I 
&gt; think it is... an EVP Box, maybe???
