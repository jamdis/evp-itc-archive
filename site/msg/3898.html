&gt;  I did not intend to quit the group, I just needed to stop the e-
mail, that was too much. I was staying up past midnight trying to 
read and respond. I probably stayed up too many nights in a rwo 
workng on that board, till 2am Saturday morning, the 3 am Sunday, and 
the till about 1a on Monday  night, then stayed up til midnight 
Monday on e-mail, then I couldn&#x27;t sleep. i need this board done post 
hast, so I can do another over the Holidays, want to see how 
difficult it is to add shortwave, just one more coil, and switching--
I think.
