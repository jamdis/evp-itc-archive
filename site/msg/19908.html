&gt;   I love that you&#x27;re able to catch these things, Frank. I can hear the
&gt; message clearly, but I&#x27;ll tell you right now that I would have missed it
&gt; over and over again during the review.
&gt;
&gt; Between you &amp; Hultay, it&#x27;s inspiring to see that one is able to attain this
&gt; level and proficiency of &quot;hearing&quot; when it comes to GB communication (with
&gt; lots of hard work and thousands of hours of listening, no doubt).
&gt;
&gt; It gives me something to look forward to and keep working towards.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for sharing!

&gt;   This will be hard to hear, it&#x27;s not made of the usual bits of words,
&gt; just mostly out of noise. I can use/do anything else, but tobacco is
&gt; absolutely forbidden. This was a result of thinking last night that as much
&gt; second hand smoke as I have to endure, I might as well smoke.
