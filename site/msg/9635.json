He will find that the energies involved in SPIRICOM are also of a nature that can be used to help him grow mentally and spiritually and become more God-like (that is more like the beings on the higher planes) or they can be focused on trivia which will make it even harder for him to grow out of the present deplorable mess in which Western civilization&#39;s social, economic and political actions are tending toward disintegration.\n ----------------\n  * For the spiritually oriented, we report some advice given by high level spirit communicators: If SPIRICOM researchers adhere to the following procedure they will not suffer possession by negative forces.
