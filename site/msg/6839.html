Even though they portray a pretty poor image of what a lot of us do, there is an upside to their shows. They spark interest in the uninitiated enthusiast who will find their way to the meat of the research. They may start on the cheesy side but end up making a real contribution.

LC,

 

We all know that most of the paranormal community, given the opportunity would choose 

a cheesy tv sci fi ghostie show complete with mirrors, bed sheets and scary sound effects.

over legitimate selfless paranormal research purely for research's sake.

 

But if it were not for these type of shows what would all the self proclaimed psychic mediums

and paranormal experts do? crossword puzzles. Don't you realise that it is shows like this and taps that

have shown that anyone that can afford an emf detector, voice recorder and camcorder with nightshot

and a brand new shinny silver case to carry it all in, can start a paranormal investigating society and

pay their entry fee to get into places like eastern state penn. and collect "REAL" paranormal evidence.

 

maybe we should try that and stop killing ourselves doing real research and trying to gather legitimate evidence.

 

come on you guy's knew I had to throw my 2 cents in!

 

Bruce

I just got to add to FS' point with respect to Paranormal State. 

Anyone notice Ron Milione (TAPS gadget electronics expert) appeared 
on Paranormal State as now a "demon expert," identifying an EVP on 
the show as a "demon" by the sound of its voice on the recording?

Then I saw Ron on the History Channel's UFO Hunters as a UFO 
researcher/expert. I'm trying to keep count, but that makes him a 
electronics guru, UFO expert and demonologist! Nice guy, but I think 
he just has a great agent that can get him these "roles." 

Also, I saw a lady have her home investigated by the Penn State bunch 
on Paranormal State and supposedly in need of their help, then I turn 
the channel and see her as a paranormal investigator on Ghost Hunters 
International! She must have a great agent, too. ;)
