&gt; Hi Marty.  What group are you involved with?  I&#x27;m from Staten Island
Paranormal Society in NY.  I agree about the drama!  We&#x27;re having a
meeting tonight and I plan on talking about some EVP experimenting.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   Hey all, joined a few days ago and just getting around to doing an
intro.
&gt; 
&gt;   The name&#x27;s Marty, I&#x27;ve known Frank (via the internet) for a year and a
&gt;   few months.
&gt; 
&gt;   Paranormal investigator, but not interested in promoting &quot;negative and
&gt;   scary&quot; as Frank calls it (or drama as I call it). Just interested in
&gt;   research, documentation, etc. 
&gt; 
&gt;   My main interest right now in ITC (beyond as a tool for communication)
&gt;   is in establishing guidelines/protocols/etc. for evaluation of
&gt;   recieved communications. I.E. you recieve a valid message (a
&gt;   confirmed ITC), now you have to go about validating its content. 
&gt;   Frank and I had a few discussions last year regarding context and
&gt;   meaning of some of the material he was recieving last year around this
&gt;   time (the changes that were to occur around May through July in 2006)
&gt;   for example.
&gt; 
&gt;   I&#x27;m very interested in hearing other list member&#x27;s experience in this
&gt;   area and look forward to contributing to this discussion list.
&gt; 
&gt;   Marty
