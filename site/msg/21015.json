Whith this , you can calculate the frecuency , and the amplitude . And you will know what is the minimum value and maximun value . \n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Equations!? I don&#39;t use any equations, if sweep isn&#39;t fast enough, I put in a smaller capacitor. I think you are making the sweep much more complicated than needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; F-S\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Luis&quot; &lt;luispucp098@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I post this archive , it contains equations to modify the kit for get apropiate linear circuit .
