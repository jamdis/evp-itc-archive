Played with the R75 shortwave a \nbit tonight.  The R75 may not scan fast enough - I&#39;ll play with \nadjusting the filters next.  I recorded a bit of it scanning and ran \nthat thru EVPmaker and got some clips - not great but it worked, so \nwent back to the doctor giving a talk raw audio on EVPmaker and got \nthese two.  Guess I&#39;ll make a box....\nWilly"}
