Zack I am not aware, and don't believe I received any warnings.  I will say that Jason did get a message regarding the Assassination over in the middle east the day before it happened.  I think he was going to upload it if he already hasn't.

couldn't locate its source. They felt it was NOT an earthquake.

Have there been any ITC messages about this??
