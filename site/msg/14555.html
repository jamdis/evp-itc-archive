Your are absolutely correct. This is why  us paranormal investigators throw 
out most EVP. It has to be completely clear.  Clear enough that many people 
hear the same thing to be considered real proof  of spirit communication. 
When in doubt, we have to throw it out. In other  words, it can't be a 
personal communication, but a communication that anyone  can make out.
 
That doesn't mean that what you guys are  getting isn't real 
communication-That doesn't mean that what you guys ar
 
It is VERY interesting to me, as you  mentioned, to see what different 
people tend to hear. It is back to the  Rorschach tests.
 
From what I have gathered about you, you  seem to be at least somewhat 
Christian, and hear Christian  prayers.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] some,



What I've noticed, is that some will hear,  a swear word   C...T, is what 
they thought that spirit said,  where, I heard two words, that is, "cut in" 
and it was a man's voice  telling someone to jump in at any time, I guess he 
meant into the  conversation, but someone I guess thought he was expressing 
a filthy  term.  It's all in what we perceive I guess, even though no one 
could  hear my mother talk on Steve's first show that I heard, she did verify  
herself, and yes, Pink was her favorite color, but I also heard her voice,  
when no one else did.  Even in real life, people will disagree on what  the 
hear and see, so it will be difficult to develop this further. Just my  
take, sf
