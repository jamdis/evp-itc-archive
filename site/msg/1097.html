<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, I&#x27;m not misleading anyone, the optical microphone using a flame in and of itself works very well in the capture of Spirit voices. I don&#x27;t know exactly why, after almost two years I am still studying it although I can speculate it could because there is a lot going on during it&#x27;s use. Change of state from liquid to vapor to heat and light, IR radiation, thermal noise and some processes I am missing or unaware of. The radio sweep is used as a source of sound samples, the microphone also works well using music or plain speech. The limited high frequency response also seems to act as a built-in bandpass filter. I&#x27;m not using anything complicated or out of the reach of a Wal-Mart or K-Mart shopper. I&#x27;m using an off the shelf oil lamp with a 3/4 inch wide flat wick, a phototransistor from Radio Shack and an FM radio.  There is more to the flame microphone then modulated light, I can modulate the DC feeding a flashlight or and LED and not get the same results. Here is an exchange using the optical microphone and FM radio sweep, my voice is reduced by 10db.
Dave: (NOT EVP) &#x27;How many of you are are testing today?&#x27;

Response : &quot;Fourty Seven&quot;

Dave: &#x27;Please state your name, thank you&#x27;

Response : &quot;Ingrid&quot;





Maybe it&#x27;s dumb question, but..................

 If the flame is being &quot;modulated&quot; by air movements caused by 
atmosphereic sound pressure waves, so the flame varies at an audio 
rate, then those flame variations are picked up via the photo 
transistor and converted to electrical signals...what&#x27;s the difference 
between the optical mic, and an accoustic mic? And why would one want 
to introduce yet another seemingly exotic piece of hardware?

 I know it&#x27;s interesting, but it really has nothing to do with how to 
get ghost voices, and maybe misleading to some that are searching for 
that magic technology.
