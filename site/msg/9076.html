Bruce,how can I make my own Franks box? My friend Leslie owns an 1800s farm house here in Stafford Virginia and we have picked up many ghost whispers in her home.  I have an RCA digital voice recorder. How can you shorten the recordings to get just the questions and ghost answers? I am really new at this but I am so excited because Leslie's home is so active. Do you know Leslie? She bowls with Brenda.

A minibox is a spirit communication box that works on the same premise as Frank's box or the RS hack.
It was developed by Paranormal systems and marketed by them for sale. It was put on the market before the RS boxes where discovered
so Because it was smaller than a frank's box, I guess they decided to name it the mini box. It carried a heavy price tag. 399.00 before
the production models and 499.00 after.
 
It was meant for experienced resaechers and para investigating groups. Not the average new person interested in experimenting with box research.
I own one, but have never quite gotten the caliber of communication that I recieve from other boxes. The RS hacks came on the seen shortly after the minibox,
they worked just as well and you could be up and running for under 50.00. So that kind of put the nail in the coffin for the minibox.
 
I have gotten information from the inventor and distributer of the minibox, that they have a newer more beefed up version they are calling the Maxi box.
And it should be available before long.

      Ok, what's a mini box?
Logically, I'd think it is a small version of Frank's original box?
But, experience has taught me never to assume. lol
