There has been some evidence\nthat some EVP recordings are meant for one individual only.  I&#39;ve been\non investigations where there were 5 or more people recording audio\nsimultaneously and only one got an EVP ... then later another person\ngot a different EVP and no one else.\n\nWith ITC, it&#39;s a whole different game.  It appears someone somewhere\nis selectively making a tuner pass certain words or parts of words\nfrom a radio station and having those come through as messages. The\nmechanism seems to be completely different than the ghost hunting EVP.\n\nSort of like the difference between talking to someone and driving\nyour car into their garage.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn 11/9/10, Adriana Jones &lt;adrianamjones@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This has probably already been discussed a hundred times over by people\n&gt; building ghost boxes, but... what&#39;s the average emf range of ghosts... and\n&gt; would creating sounds in that emf range make it easier for the ghosts to\n&gt; communicate?  And would it be possible to make those sounds heard somehow?\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
