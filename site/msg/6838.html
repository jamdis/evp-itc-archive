LC,
 
We all know that most of the paranormal community, given the opportu=
nity would choose 
a cheesy tv sci fi ghostie show complete with mirrors, b=
ed sheets and scary sound effects.
over legitimate selfless paranormal rese=
arch purely for research's sake.
 
But if it were not for these type of sho=
ws what would all the self proclaimed psychic mediums
and paranormal expert=
s do? crossword puzzles. Don't you realise that it is shows like this and t=
aps that
have shown that anyone that can afford an emf detector, voice reco=
rder and camcorder with nightshot
and a brand new shinny silver case to car=
ry it all in, can start a paranormal investigating society and
pay their en=
try fee to get into places like eastern state penn. and collect "REAL" para=
normal evidence.
 
maybe we should try that and stop killing ourselves doin=
g real research and trying to gather legitimate evidence.
 
come on you guy=
