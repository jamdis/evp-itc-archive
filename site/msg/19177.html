<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was on one investigation with about 8 others where I had both a digital
audio recorder and a video recorder going. I got the same EVP on both
machines. Other people next to me did not get them. In other cases they got
EVP and I, a couple feet away, got nothing on either machine. That was
fascinating to me.

&gt; I&#x27;ve been into the Paranormal for 33 years,and I agree about picking up
&gt; different evps off multi digital recorders on a investigation,we even pick
&gt; up responses off camcorders and not on recordesr.When using FB boxes # 77-#
&gt; 80 we always use digital recorders/cams...We always get evps and recordings
&gt; with out any of the FB boxes...When using the boxes brings a whole new
&gt; aspect to responses.I have more luck on FM sweep,but the responses I get are
&gt; just too unreal.Had a friend over a couple weeks ago and he &quot;Didn&#x27;t believe&quot;
&gt; in anything in this field,I asked the Q: Whats Al doing tomorrow? Answer:
&gt; going home..Next Q: hows he getting there? Answer: Flying on plane.......I
&gt; have asked the Q..Are you from past present or future amd get some wild
&gt; answers......
