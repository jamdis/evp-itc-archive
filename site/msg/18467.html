&gt;  Hmmm, I don&#x27;t know, I thought they were always here. Plus I don&#x27;t think
&gt; they have to be present to communicate. I used to get some saying they were
&gt; in other cities, like etheric versions of our towns.
&gt;
&gt;  We seem to have an old man that died here and doesn&#x27;t to know it. I&#x27;ve
&gt; gottewn his voice twice on two different boxes, and one of the kids friend
&gt; knew the guy.

&gt;&gt; It is interesting that you posted this because I was thinking of asking
&gt;&gt; the group if using the box, a digital recorder, EVP Maker, and the like
&gt;&gt; created any odd occurences in your home. I have had things happen and it
&gt;&gt; always seems to be after I have spent some time trying to communicate with
&gt;&gt; one of those methods. Does this kind of communication bring spirits into
&gt;&gt; your home? Has anyone else had similar experiences to Rick?
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Country
