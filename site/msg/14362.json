IMO, that is the biggest problem that serious \n&gt; researchers of any  field face-their own biases. It is good to be skeptical, but you \n&gt; HAVE to keep  open to any possibility, and realize that there can be holes in \n&gt; even your own,  well thought out theories.

I think I paid $50. \n&gt; They are very  light and comfortable for full headphones. They have thick, \n&gt; padded ear cuffs  and a padded headband. The others I have-the ear bud types, \n&gt; make my ears hurt.

I does \n&gt; have a cadence similar to someone speaking, but it could just as  easily be \n&gt; something present in the environment-&lt;WBR&gt;a natural background  noise. There is \n&gt; no way for me to tell for certain as it is just too feint. I  can&#39;t make \n&gt; out any clear words. Sure-I could probably matrix some in, but that  is all it \n&gt; would be. For an EVP to be considered proof positive of spirit  \n&gt; communication by the community at large, it has to be clear enough that many  people \n&gt; hear the same thing, without hints or coaxing. If you have to have high  \n&gt; quality devices to make it out, it just isn&#39;t good enough. That does not mean  it \n&gt; isn&#39;t a true EVP, just that it isn&#39;t good enough to stand as evidence. As  \n&gt; for the whistle, it sounded like feedback to me as well, but I will have to  \n&gt; take you word for it that you were no where near any other electronics or  \n&gt; EMF&#39;s that could contribute to feedback. Even so, if I am trying to remain  \n&gt; unbiased and objective, there is no way for me to say this is a spirit,  \n&gt; without personally being with you when you caught it. The only thing I can  \n&gt; still say about it is could be, but for me it is non conclusive. If someone  \n&gt; does not hear what you are hearing, try to remain objective and just  \n&gt; understand that it isn&#39;t personal. You have to understand that with just these  \n&gt; recordings alone, there is no way to scientifically prove what you have  \n&gt; recorded is spirit communication. If you could get consistent, intelligent  \n&gt; question and answer recordings, then you would be alot closer. Here again, we  are \n&gt; back to the &quot;So what?&quot; thing.

In my short time I have gathered  enough &quot;proof&quot; for myself \n&gt; that this method works for ME. And from what I have  seen from others that I \n&gt; have let &quot;listen&quot; to my files (friends) I am blessed  with the &quot;ability&quot; to \n&gt; HEAR very low audio artifacts... Go to my Folder in the files  section &quot;Jim&#39;s \n&gt; RR-DR60 EVP&#39;s&quot; and see if anyone (needs to) decide &quot;FOR ME&quot; and  let me \n&gt; know if I am of the serious type.

And I am OPEN to any help to reach my goals (or help  others) \n&gt; with their goals. Have fun people. On a HAPPIER NOTE :) I was lucky  enough to \n&gt; catch the RR-DR60 taking a nap yesterday...&lt;WBR&gt;.it missed a few  evp&#39;s real \n&gt; close together (in a 5 second clip) the Sony ICD-B7 heard a male  use a \n&gt; different number than what I used. I said 16 (my earlier age I was  saying in \n&gt; recorder) and the male evp said 13....then a female laughs. All this  was \n&gt; missed by the DR60 (except my 16 was recorded in both recorders) BUT  Go to my \n&gt; Folder in the files  section &quot;Jim&#39;s RR-DR60 EVP&#39;s&quot; and see if anyone (needs \n&gt; to) decide &quot;FOR ME&quot; and  let me know if I am of the serious type.
