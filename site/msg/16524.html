<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just a guess, since I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with this - probably
the mesages are meant for one user and it&#x27;s best if one user listens at a
time.

It could be that some messages come through that are meant for multiple
users at once. I&#x27;ve heard the same things as Frank in some of the recordings
he&#x27;s posted. FWIW.

&gt;   Thanks Zack.  So how do you see not asking it questions squaring with
&gt; Frank&#x27;s comment of &quot;It&#x27;s not the device, it&#x27;s the user. The messages
&gt; received are for the user, and rarely does anyone hear the same thing as the
&gt; original listener.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Does that mean two people can&#x27;t use it together?  How would they know which
&gt; the message was for if they do?  Or is it best to only use it alone?

&gt; I don&#x27;t think any of us know really who or what the &quot;entities&quot; are. They
&gt; have told a few people who they are, but given the propensity of some to
&gt; lie, who knows?
&gt;
&gt; I also believe you do not need to ask any questions at all - just let the
&gt; box run and listen to what comes out, maybe record it at the same time so
&gt; you can replay it later.

&gt;&gt;   Perhaps I am not being clear.  I am not asking how it works.  I am
&gt;&gt; asking what you claim it does.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For example, from your statements below, I get:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &quot;The Frank&#x27;s box allows entities to use FM and AM radio broadcast as raw
&gt;&gt; material, which these enties select and shape to communicate with the user.
&gt;&gt; The messages received are for the user, and rarely does anyone hear the same
&gt;&gt; thing as the original listener.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can you be any more specific as to what you mean by &#x27;entities&#x27;?
&gt;&gt; Also, can the user be defined as the person asking the box questions?
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  It&#x27;s a freaking radio!  The tuning is swept across the entire band, AM or
&gt;&gt; FM, the resulting bits of speech, music, and noise are used by the enitites
&gt;&gt; as a raw material to build their voices from. The sweep can be linear,
&gt;&gt; random, or manual, and it does not have to cover the entire broadcast band.
&gt;&gt; This is one method and device for providing the raw audio, and if you&#x27;re
&gt;&gt; tesitng to see if it&#x27;s just broadcast fragments, consider this-the concept
&gt;&gt; is the same as EVPmaker, EVPmaker runs on a computer, the entities
&gt;&gt; manipulate that raw audio *inside* the conmputer, and if you think stray
&gt;&gt; RF is going to get *inside* the hard drive and mix with the audio file
&gt;&gt; you have no clue how any technology works.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Testing is irrelavent! It&#x27;s not the device, it&#x27;s the user. The messages
&gt;&gt; received are for the user, and rarely does anyone hear the same thing as the
&gt;&gt; original listener.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  You test it by use, you judge it by what comes through and what it means
&gt;&gt; to you, you can&#x27;t play the sound snipets to a panel of numbnuts(objective
&gt;&gt; listeners)) and expect to get an unbiased/honest test. No two people hear
&gt;&gt; the same, so an &quot;objective listener&quot; is an insult to most people doing this
&gt;&gt; work.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I know, I&#x27;m being harsh.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey all, I&#x27;ve seen lots of people posting their perspectives and results
&gt;&gt;&gt; and such about the Frank&#x27;s Box. In order to help develop some good testing
&gt;&gt;&gt; for it, I think the first step is to get a common or official consensus or
&gt;&gt;&gt; statement on what it is the Frank&#x27;s Box is claiming to be doing. This might
&gt;&gt;&gt; seem a silly question, but I think it&#x27;s important to make sure any testing
&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn&#x27;t go off in some irrevelevant direction.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Frank - or anyone - what is a good official statement on what the Frank&#x27;s
&gt;&gt;&gt; box can do?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
