&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Well, I&#x27;ll still be hoping... and watching things like composite Z-scores
&gt; at the EGG project. After all, the dates could refer to something in their
&gt; world, not ours, but still show up here as energy anomalies... if we know
&gt; where to look.
&gt;
&gt; Checking last year&#x27;s EGG composite numbers, I see a notable drop between
&gt; August 14th (7 spikes) and 15th (7 spikes), and the 16th (4 spikes) and the
&gt; 17th (3 spikes).
&gt;
&gt; That doesn&#x27;t mean anything, of course, but it&#x27;s something that I check now
&gt; &amp; then. (I&#x27;d have a better sense of the significance if August&#x27;s monthly
&gt; graph was available, but that file is showing no data right now.)
&gt;
&gt; On May 7th of this year, there was a significant dip (6 spikes on the 6th,
&gt; 2 on the 7th, then 6 on the 8th). But, it was one of three similar dips this
&gt; month. I&#x27;m not sure that they correlate to anything geopolitical.
&gt;
&gt; There may come a time when the puzzle pieces fit together. Until then, I
&gt; feel a little color-blind trying to figure which piece goes where, and which
&gt; aren&#x27;t even part of the puzzle I&#x27;m studying!
&gt;
&gt; Cheerfully,
&gt; Fiona

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve gotten dates before, and nothing happens. It&#x27;s a non-specific
&gt; &gt; rpediction, so it doesn&#x27;t mean much. We had August 15th last year,
&gt; nothing,
&gt; &gt; and I had May 7th, this year, nothin&#x27;. someday something will happen on
&gt; one
&gt; &gt; of these dates and we&#x27;ll have our proof ;-0
