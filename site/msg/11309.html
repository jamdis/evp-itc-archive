<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks! Well, the Sony Arm Band radio is almost usable, FM being 
pretty weird. AM works with the usual 8 volt tuning voltage, but FM 
is tuned from 8 volts to 13 volts, probably because FM is also used 
for TV and weather. I&#x27;ll probably use it as an AM only box. 

 The Honda radio seems usable. It was new enough that it had the anti 
theft feature, requiring an access code to even turn on the radio. 
Fortunately, someone had written the code on the bottom of the radio. 
I was able to work on the pin out of the tuner modules, not only 
that, I had one of these exact same radios back in 2004, but no code, 
so never could figure out the tuners. I did keep the tuner modules, 
so hopefully I&#x27;ll have two sets.

 Producing this stuff always seems to cause problems, and I don&#x27;t 
know what the solution is.

&gt; Hey Frank!
&gt; Dont ya just love thrift stores?!  Its amazing what ya can 
find in those places if you actually go in and look.  I not to 
big on the 469 but I thik thatsonly cuz of the clicking...it just 
annoys me and I end up focusing on that rather than voices.  
Wish I had the ability to make a box...maybe if they approve me 
for school in the fall I&#x27;ll take a cpl classes that would help...its 
not criminal justice but it could be an elective hmmm, I&#x27;ll have to 
check into that.  Hope ur havin a good weekend so far.  Oh 
I heard from that guy finally, we didnt get the boxes of radio parts! 
I was hopin...but I&#x27;ll keep my eye out for more, ya never know what 
people are giving away on freecycle!

&gt; Hi All;
&gt;  
&gt;  Busy-busy-busy! I found the RS arm band radio works the best, 
the 469 is a POS, mess with it too much and it quits working. I have 
one with bad AM, and another with F&#x27;d-Up FM. I found this Sony 
at the thrift store of $6.99, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s usable yet, but it&#x27;s 
better than $35 for the RS. Anoither Honda radio, this one is only a 
maybe at this point. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Techno question; I see people making banks of RS 12-469s, and 
I can only ask why!?  Some seem to have the technical 
expertise to build the sweep circuit, why not just make a simple box 
that&#x27;s proven to work? I wouldn&#x27;t use that multi-radio set up, it&#x27;d 
be impossible to understand anything from it.  It would seem 
more cost effective to start wit something that works. 
&gt;  
&gt;  The 12-470 can use an external sweep voltage, but you have to 
locate the converter stage that turns the digital pulses into a 
voltge the varactor can use. It takes the 8 volts (max) for AM, but 
FM is weird, it tunes form +4 to 8 volts. I have newer car tuners 
like this as well.
