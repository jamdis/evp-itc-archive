<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Allen,

Looks like plans have changed and I won&#x27;t be at the Stanley Hotel 
paranormal event after all.  There was some sort of disconnect and my 
name didn&#x27;t show up on the guest list, so they couldn&#x27;t give me a 
room there. That&#x27;s what the hotel supervisor said last night 
anyway... and it&#x27;s too late in the game to follow this up.
He did say about 245 people will be in attendance, so you should have 
a good time.
Frank Sumption and I were both on their speaking agenda to talk and 
use some new devices for half the group at a time, but I heard Frank 
might not be able to make it either.

I hope to meet you and April at a future event sometime...

&gt; Mike,
&gt;
&gt; I like the microphone. What did you use if you don&#x27;t mind giving
&gt; specifics?
&gt;
&gt; April and I will be at the Stanley also. We will be selling TAPS
&gt; merchandise and magazines. Stop by if you get a chance. We would
&gt; like to meet you.
