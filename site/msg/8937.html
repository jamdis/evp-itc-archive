<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Jeff.  By the time you buy the unit and pay taxes on it, pay the eBay listing fee, spend 
your time doing the hack, and packing/shipping, you might be losing money at that price.

&gt; Stefan,

&gt; This guy who sells on Ebay does get 55.00 a unit for them.  He is out  f New 
&gt; York.  He originally wanted 129.00 for it.  I was considering  posted a 12-469 
&gt; for 24.95 plus shipping and I will modify it for free or if  anyone wanted 
&gt; too I was going to post the instructions to modify one on the same  add just to 
&gt; screw with this guy.  What do you thing?

&gt; On ebay I just saw a RS12-469 in a auction and the bid was $49.95.  I  can&#x27;t 
&gt; believe this shit that people try to pull off.

&gt; Hi Jeremy,  hi group,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Holy shit! That&#x27;s insane! Well, if people are paying  for it, then more
&gt; &gt; power to &#x27;em.
&gt; 
&gt; On ebay.de I saw one for €25  (about €40), what is still expensive for
&gt; such an old and low-quality  device.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the Raudive method with a  germanium diode.
&gt; &gt; Radio shack only carries silicon, so I&#x27;ll have to  order the germanium
&gt; &gt; and give it a shot.
&gt; 
&gt; You could also try a  schottky diode which is more sensitive than a
&gt; german diode. See:  http://en.wikipediagerman diogerman digerma
