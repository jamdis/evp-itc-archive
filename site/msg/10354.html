<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rob.  What I&#x27;ve noticed in some of my recordings is that sometimes mundane things, 
such as recorder movement, or brushing against a jacket, can sound like EVP.  Sometimes 
it is, and sometimes it isn&#x27;t.  I do hear what sounds like the words &quot;help me&quot; in your clip, 
but given the circumstances, it&#x27;s really hard to say for sure.  It sounds very similar to 
brushing against the fabric windbreakers are made from.

Ordinarily I would say try to recreate it but that&#x27;s pretty hard given you were on a plane.  
For example, one time I got what I thought was an EVP while opening my mailbox.  But 
then I thought, nope, it&#x27;s just the mailbox sound.  In that case, I was able to go back out, 
open/close the door repeatedly in order to compare, and as it turned out, I think I really 
did have an EVP because all the tests sounded only like a mailbox, if that makes sense.

As for someone in spirit being on a plane ... well ... my thought is this:  They go where we 
go.  If you are on a plane, and someone connected with you for whatever reason saw an 
opportunity to make contact, then they might take advantage of that opportunity, just 
because they could.  

I&#x27;m not sure what could have been meant by the words &quot;help me&quot; because there is nothing 
to put them into context.  It seems like sometimes those in spirit we hear via EVP are 
talking directly to us, and sometimes they are talking to each other and we are in essence 
eavesdropping on them.

In a airport, I imagine it would also be more possible than normal to pick up on RF.  
Though I admit, that doesn&#x27;t have the sound of stray signal to me, but it&#x27;s important to 
keep in mind that our recorders can and do pickup misc signals from the air.  This is one 
reason why I personally think that context, and apparent meaningful responses are 
important in ruling out what is referred to as &#x27;false positives&#x27; (mistaking something 
mundane for something paranormal).

So, I guess given all my above ramblings, you might put this in the &quot;maybe&quot; file.  And 
move on to doing other sessions where you can determine, more definitively, if the results 
based on circumstances are strongly suggestive of the content being &#x27;real&#x27; EVP.

Just my fifty cents on the subject.  ;-)

Welcome to the wonderfully mysterious, sometimes whacky, but never boring world of 
EVP.

&gt; Hi all, new to the group...I recorded this by accident on plane last 
&gt; year while waiting to take off, and trying to figure out an mp3 player 
&gt; my son just bought me.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s real or not...I remember 
&gt; no one was talking around me at the time...could it have been some 
&gt; random fabric sound?
&gt; 
&gt; If it is real, how likely for someone on the other side to be on an 
&gt; air plane, and what kind of help would they need?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Rob
