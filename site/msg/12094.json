Each time I get direct responses back it amazes still.  I really like the look on my mrs&#39;s face when I let her here one.  It cracks me up.  She doesn&#39;t do sessions with me or get involved in my research, but she&#39;ll listen to a clip every now and then.  \n\n    As far as the batteries, yes, they will get drained if something is around.  I eventually switched over to another hacked radio that had a normal AC adapter power plug just to keep going.  \n\n\nAll the best,\nBryan\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: ourobouros2k2 &lt;ourobouros2k2@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Tuesday, September 9, 2008 3:23:45 PM\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] First run, 12-469 in my apartment\n\n\nThought I would let everyone know about my wife and I&#39;s first run with \nthe modded 12-469 shack box today.

Goes without saying I will be \nconducting another session in the near future. One odd thing, the \nrecorder I had running at the time inexplicably lost power (new batt) \nat 6:12 minutes in the middle of the session, so I missed recording the \nlast half.
