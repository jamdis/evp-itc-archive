It would be a great chance to try out one \n&gt;of the new boxes and get some orders for the prototypes. Orders=$$ for new \n&gt;parts.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   This is close to my home, at teh Stanley Motel. I probably won&#39;t go, I \n&gt;need\n&gt;to spend too much for parts. I found this through the Ghost Village.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Calling All Ghost Hunters and Ghost Lovers,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The National Ghost Hunters Getaway is proud to present\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;���The Shining��� Investigation\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;January 27th & 28th 2007\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Join professional, amateur hunters and just plain ghost lovers as they\n&gt; &gt;investigate the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, CO. This magnificent Hotel \n&gt;was\n&gt; &gt;the inspiration to Stephen King���s ���The Shining��� and he himself spent time\n&gt; &gt;there developing his horrific nightmare, that we still enjoy today. \n&gt;Granted\n&gt; &gt;the spirits in his award winning book are more on the devilish side. The\n&gt; &gt;hotel does house some of the less life threatening spooks and has \n&gt;possibly\n&gt; &gt;done so shortly after its opening in 1909. This amazing structure offers\n&gt; &gt;the ghost hunters a late night investigation as we venture into it���s\n&gt; &gt;darkened halls and closed down facilities. The night may hold an eerie\n&gt; &gt;silent chill, but who���s to say some spirits are just dieing to speak to \n&gt;an\n&gt; &gt;unsuspecting ghost hunter. So spend the weekend learning what other ghost\n&gt; &gt;hunters do, collecting evidence, sharing your findings or just make new\n&gt; &gt;paranormal friends as we investigate the ghosts of Haunted Stanley Hotel.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Tickets for this event are $35 per person\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Rooms are $99 a night (double occupancy) for this special event\n&gt; &gt;So please remember to let them know you are with the Ghost Hunters \n&gt;Getaway\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;You will be responsible for your our own travel and hotel arrangements.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;More details and event are being scheduled, so please feel free to \n&gt;contact\n&gt; &gt;AGHOST at\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Phone: 253 203-4383 or email Theresaghost@...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Fixing up the home?
