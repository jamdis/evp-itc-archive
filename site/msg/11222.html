<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Aliens supposedly from Zeta Reticuli, the guys that hijacked the 
Hills back in the early 60&#x27;s, and supposedly channeled by Nancy 
Lieder of zatatalk.com

 Not only did I get the voice, but one their faces showed up in the 
shower window. 
 
 Everytime I get these warnings I get this pain in the middle of the 
night that starts i nthe center of my back, goes through my checst, 
then trevels up to my head, and even my teeth hurt. I&#x27;ve had this 
several times, and it only lasts minutes.

&gt;  I had a warning about June sixth earlier on the tape, and nthe 
past few months, even tonight while I was tweaking a box they were 
talking about it live, but I only catch about half the live stuff. 
Thank the Zetas--I guess, if nothing happens.  Frank-S
