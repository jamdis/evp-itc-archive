I've had the H4 and the edirol r-09, both h=
ave superior sound quality. Just like Zack, i bought it to record my band d=
uring practice. 

When i took up ghost box stuff, i just used what i had.

=
For regular evp work, i use my 2 panasonic rr-dr60's, rrqr200 and rrqr100. =
I also have the rt-evp, which is great for evps. The sound quality on that =
recorder is unbelievable.

It also has a ghost box built in, but i don't us=
e that feature. I think you can get that around $200 now on ebay. For my gh=
ost box work, i use my edirol r-09.
