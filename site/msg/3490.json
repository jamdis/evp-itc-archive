For one person to say he is the &quot;pr=\r\nimary tester&quot; is inaccurate, he was the first that kinda understood how it =\r\nwas supposed to be used, or so I thought. I think we left the &quot;treting phas=\r\ne&quot; some time ago, perhaps it&#39;s time to return barrowed equipment?  I wasn&#39;t=\r\n quite finished with that e-mail-- I hit the send button in my rush to get =\r\noff to work.     I put out a box use guideline thing a year or two ago stat=\r\ning that no one has the right to take my equipment and and claim their use =\r\nsupercedes anyones else&#39;s use, or results. So, to contiue...  As a far as &quot;=\r\ntechnicians&quot; I don&#39;t get any of that stuff, but---they do talk about a netw=\r\nork, and connection to our equipment. When I first made my &quot;Ghostman&quot; box, =\r\nlast week, it wasn&#39;t working well, but a day or so later, it came to life, =\r\nand one of the voices said it had been connected to &quot;the network&quot;. Supposed=\r\nly there is a similar connection made to computers running EVPmaker. I&#39;m no=\r\nt sure if these &quot;network&quot; connections are maintained if equipment is taken =\r\nout for investigations, or demostrations. Of cousre, I can&#39;t say if these n=\r\networks are a fact. I would think as maker of the box, these etheric techs =\r\nmight want to give me, or others some hints.  As far as the ghost box, or F=\r\nrank&#39;s box, being a &quot;telephone to the dead&quot;, I think is very poor analogy, =\r\nthe old style phone system of Edison&#39;s day had operators, plural, not one p=\r\nerson that recieved all calls, then interpreted what was being said to othe=\r\nr parties. That&#39;s more of a master control schema.The old phone system didn=\r\n&#39;t charge you an arm and a leg to talk to someone in the same room either! =\r\nSome might say these &quot;Technicains&quot; are the operators, but even if anyone es=\r\nle could hear these voices, why do you need someone to interpret what&#39;s bei=\r\nng said. I say if not many can hear it, or something similar, it ain&#39;t real=\r\n! There is a certain kind of conatct, ion that that your own mind uses the =\r\nnoise as a sort of psychic prop, you hear the stuff in your head, it may be=\r\n accurate and real inforamntiion, but no one else is going to hear it. i th=\r\nink that what all this supposed converstions wiht Edison maybe.  I have in =\r\nfact heard a voice that said &quot;Edison here&quot; but there was no other real info=\r\nrmation conveyed that I could understand.  As for portals, demons and evil =\r\nspirits entering the world through these &quot;unauthorized&quot; boxes, I an only sa=\r\ny, as the original mker of the box, I have gotten voices cuzzing, swearing,=\r\n name calling, and even threatening, but nothing that has seemingly &quot;entere=\r\nd&quot; our world. Even those &quot;threatening entities&quot;, when pressed to bring it, =\r\nfold up like paper tigers. These beings and spirits already exist all aroun=\r\nd us, and at a higher level, so they have full access to this, a lower leve=\r\nr. Besides. There is that &quot;network&quot; that seem to allow for better contacts,=\r\n and kinda helps highter being to come through.   I made these &quot;boxes&quot;! The=\r\n idea was not &quot;Edisons Telephone...&quot; What I got was an assemblage of my own=\r\n expereince and knowlegde, put together by my own mind as answer to my ques=\r\ntion of what else could I use for spirit comuncation. All technology involv=\r\ned was based on what I had worked on in the past for radio experimentation.=\r\n I had in fact, a couple years before my interest in EVP, been experimentin=\r\ng with voltage tunable radio modules removed from car stereos for AM DX, th=\r\nat&#39;s listening to distant AM radio stations. I was hoping to find other tal=\r\nk shows similar to Art Bell, and there used to be one out of Cincinati(?). =\r\nThe idea of using a random voltage to tune the radio was after using EVPmak=\r\ner, which uses a method of generating random speech bits for the entities t=\r\no use. It was a small leap to apply the random technique to an anolog syste=\r\nm. I am not the first to be focusing on a problem, and have the mind provid=\r\ne an solution in complete form. Nothing mystical about it. The fact is, aft=\r\ner much work, and experimenting, the tuning doesn&#39;t have to be random, a li=\r\nnear tuning works much better. Yet another fact of  the box, covienently ig=\r\nnored.  What really chaps my hide, as maker of the box, is to have someone,=\r\n who knows nothing of electronics, and technology completely ignore everyth=\r\ning I say about the box, and presume to tell me how it really works, how it=\r\n should be used, and what is acceptable from it. This guy is so honest, he =\r\nwon&#39;t even use his real name, but huff and puff at at anyone that contradic=\r\nts his use of my equipment. I say, as &quot;a Tester&quot; if you can&#39;t use it in an =\r\nhonest manor, bring the stuff back--testing over! Like it or not, the publi=\r\nc has this technology, you can keep pissing and moaning, trying to spread f=\r\near, or you could choose the way of Light.
