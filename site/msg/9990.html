<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>In regards to the Spiricom story - I have to assume you&#x27;re referring to 
the Mark IV model as diagrammed/written up in the Spiricom manual (as 
opposed to the INCORRECT diagram made by Polish researcher Wojciech 
Drewniak...http://www.worlditc.org/k_06_spiricom.htm ).

While my research is still not finished (and I&#x27;ve been working on this 
for a little over 2 years), I&#x27;m leaning toward the Mark IV 
conversations as having been hoaxed by Bill O&#x27;Neil. HOWEVER - I believe 
he acted alone and that none of the other members of the Metascience 
Foundation were involved with this hoax. As to O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s motivation for 
the hoax - I still don&#x27;t know. But I will also say that the veridical 
evidence that O&#x27;Neil claims to have received about Dr. George J. 
Mueller through clairaudience is amazing and it is tough to see how 
O&#x27;Neil would have gotten this information given his finances, location, 
the timeframe, etc.

I&#x27;ve been promising to get my personal website up and operating for 
some time now but have been busy. Hopefully soon. Then I&#x27;ll start 
posting what I have found out so far.

P.S. The recordings of the Spiricom cassette that can be found at the 
GOS website ( http://www.ghostpix.com/spiricom/spiricom.html ) are very 
poor. Scott L over at Ghostly Talk pulled much a much cleaner version 
directly from a source cassette provided to him by Mark Macy ( see 
Ghostly Talk show archive noted as a &quot;Bonus&quot; and &quot;Repost&quot; for August 
22, 2006: http://www.ghostlytalk.com/node/616 ).

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt;     I&#x27;m new on this group. Not too sure whether this topic was 
&gt; discussed already or not but I wanted to get your oppinion on the 
&gt; Spiricon device.  Does anyone know more about it?
