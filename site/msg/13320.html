Sure, comments are always welcome either good or bad. That's ho=
w we 
progress in what we do, different points of view are always 
importan=
t. This research is still new and very unexplainable, but we 
devise theori=
es (Not Facts) as we go along in hopes that we are right 
or at least on th=
e right path. I have several samples and 
information on my web site if you=
 are interested in how i go about 
what i call RTSC (Real Time Spirit Commu=
nication) research.

www.keyportparanorm al.com

I also have a yahoo group =
dedicated to this with some of our theories 
and documents that we feel mig=
ht help others in understanding this a 
bit more. Other opinions of course =
are always welcome.
