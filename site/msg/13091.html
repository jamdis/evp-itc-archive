<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That sounds like an extremely important discovery, Laurie.
If you have found that recorders are sensitive to some radio
frequencies, and those recorders and those frequencies have not been
well tested or documented, then potentially some recorders are also
senstive to normal AM/FM, as well as other frequencies.  This should
bring into serious question any EVPs people have gotten, unless they
know those sensitivies beforehand.

&gt; YES!

&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; We have had cell phones set off our EMF meters.
&gt; 
&gt; What made me ban the use of two way radios was when I noticed that
they were causing interference on the DVRs..
&gt; 
&gt; they also cause humming and static on some audio recorders - as do
some cell phones.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; For large aeas like Gettysburg, ffort Mifflin, ESP, etc, what we do
is map out the area ahead of time, with a scheduled rotation of small
groups. That way we know where everyone is at all times. So far this
has been successful for us. This method assumes a level of
responsibility and respect on the part of the investigators - I have
found that if you are doing an event where others and the public are
invited it is essential to have them see the schedule and agree to
abide by it when they sign up and then again when they arrive.

&gt; Tom, 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I own a Motorola Razor. On a recent investigation I had my Razor set
to vibrate. I recieved a phone call that set off the EMF detector and
it subsequently &quot;spiked&quot; from the color green to red and did so for
each vibra signal the the phone was receiving... This false positive
reading led me to make sure that everyones phone was instead turned
off entirely.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I have also recieved radio interference or bleed over from other
two-way radios in the area that can be confused as EVP if not
mentioned when recording audio. Still, I find 2-way radios convenient
if not necessary for larger scale field investigations. I&#x27;m sure my
colleagues in the Gettysburg area would agree with me ... but I also
hear from my friend Bill Murphy that many have resorted to hand held
GPS systems to mark particular areas of interest when conducting EVP
or ITC sessions in the field...

&gt; That&#x27;s interesting Laurie. How have you seen radios like that messing
&gt; up equipment? What equipment do you think is susceptible to that kind
&gt; of radio interference?

&gt; &gt; Two way radios - arghhh - they interfere with equipment! We forbid

&gt; &gt; I know my team when we go out we have two way radios and cellphones
&gt; so there is no yelling and we are pretty quiet. During the whole in
&gt; vestigation except prayers.But the only time we had to be loud is when
&gt; I was attacked.

&gt; &gt; Im sitting here watching Ghost Hunters...and I know alot of it is
&gt; done for drama purposes...but Im curious...when ya&#x27;ll are out on an
&gt; investigation do you talk as much as they do? I can hardly hear
&gt; anything over them chatting. Also I notice a cpl of their people
&gt; freak out when they get knocks or other responses... nobody ever says
&gt; hey thanks for the effort you put into responding or great job or
&gt; anything like that..its always wtf was that, what the hell is going on
&gt; in here, etc...do ya&#x27;ll say thanks and compliment the efforts of the
&gt; responding spirits? Ive never been on an investigation with a team so
&gt; Im kinda curious how different groups work and run things.(wish I knew
&gt; people in arizona I could go on an investigation with) I know when I
&gt; do my research here with my radio shack hack I always say thanks and
&gt; am polite and have never freaked out or cussed in response to one of
&gt; the responses Ive gotten. Anyways just curious. Hope everyone has a
&gt; great weekend!
