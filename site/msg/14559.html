Interesting find, though not completely surprising. This very well could be=
 an explanation for why two people in close proximity perceive different th=
ings. It can also be explained by simply not focusing ones attention or hav=
ing a persons expectations manifest via personal perception.
=A0
I did a li=
ttle research a while ago on using an=A0ultrasounic, non-linear acoustic si=
gnal as a carrier wave for audible sound. What happens with this phenomena =
is an audible signal is embedded and transmitted through the air and is cal=
culated to demodulate at certain points in three dimensional space. In othe=
r words we could transmit sound that is inaudible to anyone else around and=
 have it manifest in a 3D bubble where ever we wanted. A person standing on=
ly 2 feet away could not hear the music or speech that the person in the be=
am could.
=A0
If for some reason you believe it impossible take a look at t=
he work of=A0Dr. Joseph Pompeii. He use to work for Bose and=A0since receiv=
ed his PhD from MIT in aucoustics. He invented and owns exclusive rights to=
 what he calls the audio spotlight (google it). 
=A0
Now, I said all that t=
o say this...if it is possible to do this with sound of a low vibration rid=
ing energy of a higher vibration then could it also be possbile for a entit=
y of a higher vibration demodulating to a lower vibration=A0and manifesting=
 physically. All things in the universe consist of energic vibrations oscil=
lating at different rates and at different vectors, even what we perceive a=
s solid! Is this possible, if not why?

Thought these comments might be interesting in l=
ight of recent
threads. Dr. Sam El-Khazen recently published an article in =
the
Journal of Neuroquantology (study of brain function at the quantum
mech=
anical level). In this paper entitled "DNA The Gateway to
Time", El-Khazen =
talks about the relationship between the structure
of DNA, time, conscious =
perception and gravity. There is credible
evidence that these are intimatel=
y correlated. 

An important finding for this group has to do with how we m=
ay in
fact detect external influences in the physical world. If El-Khazen
h=
as it right, two EM waves must align in order for the preception
process to=
 even begin. If this does not happen, there is nothing to
perceive, even th=
ough we may be impacted by an external potentially
influencing EM wave. The=
 second wave is generated from borrowed
energy within our brain cells and i=
s modelled upon the structure of
DNA strands. So yes we are impacted by bil=
lions of EM signals per
second but we actually detect only a small portion =
of these that we
later process in the late-stage perceptual processes. 

Th=
is would nicely explain why two people would perceive events
differently de=
spite the fact that they were literally side by side
witnessing the same ev=
ent. Again this is strictly a matter of
random probability, it seems to hav=
e nothing whatsoever to do with
volition or intention. That is more the foc=
us of the later
perceptual processing which is in turn dependent upon this
=
probabilistic process.

This could also explain why it is that EVP and ITC =
signals are
perceived differently by different people even when no physical=

alteration to the media has occurred and why different things are
heard mo=
re easily at different times by the same person.
