<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>A few weeks ago I posted that Rick Moran had written an article
stating that children and high school students would be part of the
testing subjects of the mini-box. Later that day the article was
replaced with a different article about the mini-box. I was told that
I was stating mis truths. I wasn&#x27;t. I finally was able to locate the
missing article. I&#x27;m providing a link to the entire article along with
the statement regarding our children. If the link somehow becomes
unavailable, I have done a screen shot and will provide it to whoever
asks.
Believe me when I say that this isn&#x27;t to cause or stir crap. I was
basically called a liar and this clears up that misconception. If I am
banned from this group for telling the truth, than so be it. 

&quot;...it was not the question of whether the phenomenon existed to begin
with, but rather what is the phenomenon.  That will require a good
deal more effort to explore and beginning in January we will be
undertaking test sessions all over north and east Texas as well as
other national locations with a wide variety of folks to see what
happens within the group dynamic.  The testing will include folks who
are both believers and non-believers, skeptics, critics, other
researchers, children, high school students, college and grad
students, and senior citizens to name a few categories.&quot;

Are you willing to &quot;see what happens&quot; with our children?</pre>
