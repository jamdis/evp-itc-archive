<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I got this recording while out yesterday doing recordings with my
radio shack hack ghost box. I just posted it to my newly created
folder titled &quot;John Frick&quot;. I have a definite thought on what it says
but I fully realize that our perception can be colored by what we
expect to hear (our perception can also be colored by whatever someone
has said they hear, so please try to listen to it before reading
others opinions on it). I would like to get as many people&#x27;s
interpretations of what this might be saying as possible. If you have
more than one idea for what it is saying I&#x27;d like to hear it. You can
post here or email me at jfrick45@...

I diminished the static before and after the voice/noise to reduce the
irritation level of playing this multiple times. Any help with
identification would be appreciated.

I&#x27;ll update the file later with what words that seem most likely.</pre>
