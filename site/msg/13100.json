Ive never been on an investigation with a \nteam so\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Im kinda curious how different groups work and run things.(wish \nI knew\n&gt; &gt;&gt; people in arizona I could go on an investigation with) I know \nwhen I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; do my research here with my radio shack hack I always say thanks \nand\n&gt; &gt;&gt; am polite and have never freaked out or cussed in response to \none of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the responses Ive gotten.
