<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>In agreement here.  My first thoughts when I started hearing about 
commercial endeavors involving frank&#x27;s box, copies, or similar 
creations was &quot;What happens to those out there that give out this 
info for free, like - say - their inventor?&quot;  And of course the 
immediate answer was threats, lawsuits, etc.

Not to get too spiritual here, but in my life almost every contact 
I&#x27;ve had with whatever is out there has left me with the impression 
that they frown heavily on using them for personal or financial 
gain.  A good friend of mine, also named Frank, who is possibly the 
best psychic I ever met (really the only one I&#x27;ve met that I truly 
believe can speak with spirits and he has an uncanny ability to tell 
you things about yourself that he shouldn&#x27;t know) refuses to charge 
for his services because every time he tried to use his ability for 
commercial purposes it would fail him.  His &#x27;guide&#x27; as he calls it 
has flat out told him that they will not be used to make money.  LOL.

So my thought is, if this would be true, that those that stand to 
make money off of this might not be getting the results they used to 
or the results they want...combine that with the free availability of 
the information and its not a good picture for them.

&gt; &gt;  I can make two guesses One is some religous fanatic taliban type 
a-
&gt; hole thinks we are talking to demons, and letting evil into the 
&gt; world, so they have to shut it down for our own good. The other, 
and 
&gt; more likely is someone might loose money, so going to extreme 
&gt; measures.  I don&#x27;t sell my boxes, so they are relatively rare, and 
&gt; have little, but controlable  impact, but the inexpensive radios 
are 
&gt; easily obtainable, and you don&#x27;t need a guru to tell what you are 
&gt; really hearing. There&#x27;s more than one party out there that stands 
to 
&gt; loose much if the current paranormal theories, and fear crap is 
&gt; disproven, so don&#x27;t get the idea I&#x27;m talking aobut one person.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  The informatin is out there, the site contents copied by many. 
&gt; Making threats over the internet to control people is federal 
crime, 
&gt; and the FBI has a site for reproting this.    Frank-S

&gt; &gt; I just went over to their website and saw all the modification 
&gt; information was gone and a reference to a disturbing message about 
a 
&gt; threat was there. Anyone know what happened?- Mike
