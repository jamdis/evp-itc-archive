Look in the Files section of the group \non the Yahoo groups website for &quot;theghostbox.pdf&quot;. Unfortunately, he \nhas left out some details (like size/composition of the &quot;echo \nchamber&quot;, etc.) and most of the schematics are hard to read due to \ndigitizing (resolution) problems.\n\nThe key component that can be difficult to find is the Sanyo LA1135 \nAM Tuner IC that&#39;s at the heart of the system. Frank has apparently \nscrounged this chip from old car radios.\n\nHere&#39;s how it operates:\n\nThe RVG (Random Voltage Generator) output is fed to the &quot;tuning&quot; \ninput of the LA1135 AM radio receiver. What this basically does is \nsimilar to a human being rapidly and randomly hitting the tuning \nstation buttons in a car radio or varying the tuning dial of a \nstationary or portable radio. The output of this randomly-tuned AM \nradio is then fed to a small speaker into an internal &quot;echo chamber&quot; \n(although his box also provides an output jack for an external \nspeaker to use an external &quot;echo chamber&quot; or even just the room) \nwhich also contains a small electret microphone (these are the types \nthat a very tiny and can be clipped to your lapel, tie, etc.). The \noutput of this mike is then fed to another speaker (or optionally to \nheadphones) for the output. Where the &quot;entities&quot; interact with the \nbox is in this &quot;echo chamber&quot; (probably just a small, soundproof \nplastic box) using the speech snippets from the randomly-tuned AM \nradio stations as a carrier for any EVP.\n\nHope this helps everyone!\n\nGuy\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been doing evp research for a number of years now and have \n&gt; exhausted all venues so when something like this comes along of \ncourse \n&gt; it is a m7ust have for the serious researcher. I have been \n&gt; experimenting with the sweep method only for a few days but to me \nit is \n&gt; just another evp recording method and still needs to be edited and \nyou \n&gt; don&#39;t have that real time communication.\n&gt; I was disabled at 911 and have all the time in the world to \nexperiment \n&gt; so I believe the box would be put to good use. can anyone steer me \nin \n&gt; the right direction as far as who to contact or how to have a box \nbuilt?\n&gt; \n&gt; all help is greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; bruce\n&gt;"}
