&gt;
&gt; Well Id first wish to introduce myself. My name is Matt Dowdell and im from
&gt; a small group of people who have been doing paranormal
&gt; research/investigation in the CT area. This is my first post, but i have
&gt; been lurking threw these forums for some time.
&gt;
&gt; One thing i would like everyone who reads this realize is that paranormal
&gt; research/investigating, like any new science, nothing can be written in
&gt; stone.
&gt;
&gt; Now i do want to say that the research into the boxes and other devices by
&gt; Frank and others can not go unnoticed, but there is still one or two flaws
&gt; in them.
&gt;
&gt; I mean, with the short bit i listened to, i dont feel as if they are
&gt; bashing you or frank personally but the idea behind the boxes, but without a
&gt; doubt in a ignorant fashion.
&gt;
&gt; Regardless, i personally try to stay away from the boxes, but i join this
&gt; site inorder to learn more about them and how they work. To me the boxes
&gt; have to much &quot;chance&quot; to may be or may not be something. I have used one in
&gt; the past and had an interesting result, but for all i know, it could have
&gt; been a rogue radio wave from a station in the area. Im just hoping to give
&gt; you an idea of this thinking is VS bashing your ideas and work, which im
&gt; simpley not. Science is about proving something from every angle and being
&gt; without a doubt its correct without anyone able to say its something else.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunetly, with the boxes, there is alot of noise and when matrixing
&gt; comes into mind, you create a situation where something is absolutly
&gt; nothing, seems to be otherwise. Im not saying they dont work, from it, again
&gt; im saying it could be a &quot;chance&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Video, pictures are fool proof, audio really isnt, and honestly, when my
&gt; team picks up EVPs we go into them with a doubtful mind and dont depend on
&gt; them to be our evidence.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;

I&#x27;d y o explain how he damn hings wo k, bu I doub i would be unde s ood.
