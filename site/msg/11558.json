When I am\n&gt; facing a &quot;hostile&quot; entity I literally step out of my &quot;self&quot; and one of my\n&gt; Guides will step in an take command of whatever task we are trying to\n&gt; complete.\n&gt; The first time this happened was when my girl friend and I were on a date.\n&gt; We had gone to play some games at one of Esther&#39;s girlfriends house. The\n&gt; girlfriend was &quot;possessed.&quot; The girl friend had a date and suddenly one of\n&gt; my Guides mentioned that the young woman was possessed and needed to be\n&gt; cleansed. The Guide also mentioned that the young woman&#39;s date was a\n&gt; minister-in-training at a small school nearby. But the guy was not yet\n&gt; ready to face this type of event.\n&gt; I was told to wait until he left and then the both of us could start the\n&gt; possession ceremony. Once the guy left, Esther and I approached the young\n&gt; woman and explained what we had been shown and asked her if she wished to\n&gt; be cleansed. She said yes and asked us to start. It needs to be understood\n&gt; that this young woman was in a wheel chair because she had some sort of\n&gt; deformity of her legs and they were basically unusable.\n&gt; Esther and I started with prayers. We asked to be covered with the white\n&gt; light of the Ruach Ha-Kodesh (The Spirit, the Holy). The young woman\n&gt; started to curse us in languages that we did not understand, nor cared\n&gt; about. Eventually, the young woman levitated out of her wheel chair and\n&gt; floated through her parents house. We walked behind her saying prayers.\n&gt; Our prayers became so fervent that we understood that we were speaking to\n&gt; one another by thought and not orally. Then I felt as if I was moved aside\n&gt; in my spirit and a Guide came forward and commanded the spirit to leave.\n&gt; The young woman then slowly settled back into her wheel chair, she gave\n&gt; one more scream, and then she went limp. She feel into a really deep sleep\n&gt; of exhaustion.\n&gt; Esther tucked the girl friend into her bed covered her and stayed for the\n&gt; rest of the evening. The next morning, they both went to church and the\n&gt; young woman sang in her wheel chair as she had never had sung previously.\n&gt; Full of joy and happiness.\n&gt; Al\n&gt;\n&gt; -- &quot;Carol B.&quot; &lt;cbreck@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I should have worded that better. What happened was that during and after\n&gt; the sageing the energy really kicked it up several notches. I had placed\n&gt; my emf meter on the end of my daughters bed. While sageing, I felt an\n&gt; electrical type feeling start up the back of my hands..going all the way\n&gt; to my chest. At that time, the emf meter had a sustained, high reading.\n&gt; We continued to sage, and the emf meter was just buried in its\n&gt; readings....I left the house...leaving the emf meter on and placing a dvr\n&gt; on the bed also....we came back a couple hours later...the emf was reading\n&gt; the usual low reading, and upon playback of the dvr you could hear the\n&gt; beeping of my emf meter go crazy for about 20 minutes..after which it did\n&gt; not beep again. So, I think the sageing actually stirred up the\n&gt; entity....\n&gt;\n&gt; Carol B.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Carol, if you don&#39;t mind my asking, how did the sage and salt &quot;feed&quot; the\n&gt;&gt; energy?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jeremy\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt;&gt; From: Carol B. &lt;cbreck@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Friday, July 18, 2008 6:33:27 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] blue lighting\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Well, first, we saged and salted. That really fed the energy to the\n&gt;&gt; point\n&gt;&gt; we had to leave the house for a few hours. We did the same thing again\n&gt;&gt; and again. Then, a friend in CA called and together, on the phone, we\n&gt;&gt; got\n&gt;&gt; rid of it. You should have heard my emf meter beeping it&#39;s freaking head\n&gt;&gt; off while my friend sent his energy to get it to go. I had it on the end\n&gt;&gt; of my daughters bed...where usually there is nothing to set it off. Boy,\n&gt;&gt; did it ever react to the &quot;banishing&quot; for lack of a better word. My\n&gt;&gt; friend\n&gt;&gt; in CA is a sensitive, and helped me a great deal..I am forever thankful\n&gt;&gt; for him.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Carol B.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I apologize, I didn&#39;t know the extent of the matter, I also have a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; friend\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that had some nasty negative energy attach to them. I know what he went\n&gt;&gt;&gt; through, and no one should have to go through that. I glad to hear you\n&gt;&gt;&gt; got rid of it, and I hope it didn&#39;t hurt your daughter. If you don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;&gt; mind\n&gt;&gt;&gt; me asking how you got rid of it?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Rees\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- On Fri, 7/18/08, Carol B. &lt;cbreck@elknet. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Carol B. &lt;cbreck@elknet. net&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] blue lighting\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Friday, July 18, 2008, 4:18 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, it was not cool at all!
