I think it should be a brief description on how to do all the hacks.\n\n12-469 old\n12-469 current\n12-470 old\n12-820 current\n20-125 current\n\nDid I miss any?  For a $1 listing fee, and no hassles of buying product in advance then \nhaving to ship, that would be totally worth it.  Unlimited downloads (for how long can you \nlist - 9 days?) would reach a heck of a lot more people than selling units at cost.  :-)\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; opps I mean:\n&gt; \n&gt; Can someone send me the written instructions on how to hack the 12-\n&gt; 469!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Kay\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I checked to see what it would cost to sell one of ebay. To list \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; it is $1.00 for $25.00-449.00 plus 8.75% of the initial $25.00 \n&gt; &gt; ($2.19), plus 3.50% of the remaining closing value balance ($25.01 \n&gt; &gt; to $1,000.00)\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would be willing to list the one I have plus give the \n&gt; information \n&gt; &gt; on the free hacking and that fact that you can get one at Radio \n&gt; &gt; Shack for $24.99 just to shut this guy down. At the most I would \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; out $1.00 to not sell it!!!!

You could then list them just like the ones that are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; selling...so they pull up identical to the listings that are up \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there.  :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking if someone would list a FREE DOWNLOAD of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; instructions for the various hacks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the Radio Shack units, it could put an end to the business \n&gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sellers that are taking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of people who are unaware that they could probably \n&gt; &gt; hack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the units for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen &quot;downloads&quot; of various things listed before.
