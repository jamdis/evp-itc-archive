<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Margret,

yes, acoustical soundwaves - this could of course be a possible focus
point for manipulation by &#x27;them&#x27;. However, I&#x27;m not sure if this really
takes place. Some time ago I had made some experiments to find out if
the sound is changed for EVPs. I compared the original signal to the
signal which had been transferred acoustically, and except for the
reverberations from the room etc. I could never hear any significant
differences; thus a manipulation of soundwaves did not take place and
seemed to be unnecessary for the production of EVP. This led me to the
conclusion that &#x27;they&#x27; usually don&#x27;t manipulate our physical
surrounding.

&gt; Hi Stefan and Steve. The closest thing I&#x27;ve gotten to an answer from
&gt; &quot;Arthur&quot; about how this is working is the words &#x27;air&#x27; or &#x27;air-to-air.&#x27;
&gt; This makes little sense to me, unless there is some type of additional
&gt; manipulation taking place acoustically, because I am not recording in
&gt; a closed environment. I am playing the file from EVP Maker using an
&gt; external speaker and recording using the built-in mic of my MAC.

&gt; I have no idea, what, if any difference this might make in terms of
&gt; opportunity for &#x27;them&#x27; to speak intelligent phrases. Just thought I&#x27;d
&gt; share what I&#x27;m hearing. I&#x27;ll keep asking, and trying to get a clearer
&gt; explanation of the process (though I&#x27;ve never had much luck with that
&gt; in the past, in regard to getting explanations for the mechanics of
&gt; any other technique!)
