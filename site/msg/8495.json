Given in my opinion the boxes do open a portal \ndue \n&gt; to the connection necessary for real time two way communication, \nand \n&gt; the wide spread belief that entities can and do manipulate physical \n&gt; objects when in the presence of them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have just been made aware of a situation that has happened to a \n&gt; fairly new researcher whom I believe to be honest and forthcoming.\n&gt; \n&gt; the incident involved the aftermath of a regular RS box session. \nThe \n&gt; researcher had finished his session with the practice of asking \nthat \n&gt; any entities that may have traveled through the box, return and \nasked \n&gt; for conformation, then proceeded to end the session and turn the \nbox \n&gt; off. he was assured that he turned the box off by going back to the \n&gt; recording after the incident and validating verbally that he did in \n&gt; fact turn off the box.\n&gt; \n&gt; He left the room for a few moments , when he returned he allegedly  \n&gt; witnessed a white cloud move across the room and noticed that his \nRS \n&gt; box was turned on and running.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is actually the first instance I have encountered where the \n&gt; possibility of an entity that may have\n&gt; \n&gt; purposely stayed behind to turn the box back on and let other \n&gt; entities through. matter of fact\n&gt; \n&gt; that concept has not occurred to me before. but now sounds very \n&gt; possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; This may even happen at times we are never aware of and they \nactually \n&gt; turn the box on and when \n&gt; whatever comes through is through they turn it off again and we are \n&gt; none the wiser.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will definitely address this in my sessions, what I suggest is \n&gt; until we come to a mutual agreement among researchers\n&gt; on this occurrence, I think it best that when we end a session we \n&gt; remove at least one battery from the box to prevent it being turned\n&gt; back on.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n\n\n    \n          \t\t\t\n&lt;!--\n\n#ygrp-mkp{\nborder:1px solid #d8d8d8;font-family:Arial;margin:14px 0px;padding:0px 14px;}\n#ygrp-mkp hr{\nborder:1px solid #d8d8d8;}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd{\ncolor:#628c2a;font-size:85%;font-weight:bold;line-height:122%;margin:10px 0px;}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads{\nmargin-bottom:10px;}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad{\npadding:0 0;}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a{\ncolor:#0000ff;text-decoration:none;}\n--&gt;\n\n&lt;!--\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc{\nfont-family:Arial;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc #hd{\nmargin:10px 0px;font-weight:bold;font-size:78%;line-height:122%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc .ad{\nmargin-bottom:10px;padding:0 0;}\n--&gt;\n\t\n&lt;!--\n\n\t#ygrp-mlmsg {font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;}\n#ygrp-mlmsg table {font-size:inherit;font:100%;}\n#ygrp-mlmsg select, input, textarea {font:99% arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;}\n#ygrp-mlmsg pre, code {font:115% monospace;}\n#ygrp-mlmsg * {line-height:1.22em;}\n#ygrp-text{\nfont-family:Georgia;\n}\n#ygrp-text p{\nmargin:0 0 1em 0;}\n#ygrp-tpmsgs{\nfont-family:Arial;\nclear:both;}\n#ygrp-vitnav{\npadding-top:10px;font-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;margin:0;}\n#ygrp-vitnav a{\npadding:0 1px;}\n#ygrp-actbar{\nclear:both;margin:25px 0;white-space:nowrap;color:#666;text-align:right;}\n#ygrp-actbar .left{\nfloat:left;white-space:nowrap;}\n..bld{font-weight:bold;}\n#ygrp-grft{\nfont-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;padding:15px 0;}\n#ygrp-ft{\nfont-family:verdana;font-size:77%;border-top:1px solid #666;\npadding:5px 0;\n}\n#ygrp-mlmsg #logo{\npadding-bottom:10px;}\n\n#ygrp-reco {\nmargin-bottom:20px;padding:0px;}\n#ygrp-reco #reco-head {\nfont-weight:bold;color:#ff7900;}\n\n#reco-grpname{\nfont-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;}\n#reco-category{\nfont-size:77%;}\n#reco-desc{\nfont-size:77%;}\n\n#ygrp-vital{\nbackground-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:2px 0 8px 8px;}\n#ygrp-vital #vithd{\nfont-size:77%;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;color:#333;text-transform:uppercase;}\n#ygrp-vital ul{\npadding:0;margin:2px 0;}\n#ygrp-vital ul li{\nlist-style-type:none;clear:both;border:1px solid #e0ecee;\n}\n#ygrp-vital ul li .ct{\nfont-weight:bold;color:#ff7900;float:right;width:2em;text-align:right;padding-right:.5em;}\n#ygrp-vital ul li .cat{\nfont-weight:bold;}\n#ygrp-vital a{\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\n#ygrp-vital a:hover{\ntext-decoration:underline;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #hd{\ncolor:#999;font-size:77%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov{\npadding:6px 13px;background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov ul{\npadding:0 0 0 8px;margin:0;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov li{\nlist-style-type:square;padding:6px 0;font-size:77%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov li a{\ntext-decoration:none;font-size:130%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #nc{\nbackground-color:#eee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:0 8px;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad{\npadding:8px 0;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad #hd1{\nfont-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#628c2a;font-size:100%;line-height:122%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad a{\ntext-decoration:none;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad a:hover{\ntext-decoration:underline;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad p{\nmargin:0;}\no{font-size:0;}\n..MsoNormal{\nmargin:0 0 0 0;}\n#ygrp-text tt{\nfont-size:120%;}\nblockquote{margin:0 0 0 4px;}\n..replbq{margin:4;}\n--&gt;\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
