I&#39;ve never seen the whole show online .. We all sat \nin a \n&gt;   &gt; circle (Me, Jeffrey Wands, my Team, and the Producers) .. We \nasked \n&gt;   &gt; questions and recorded in complete silence and also as Jeffrey \nwas \n&gt;   &gt; speaking and so much of what Jeffrey said was validated in the \nEvp \n&gt;   &gt; recordings. We had over fifty Evp&#39;s. The exciting part is that \n&gt;   Maury \n&gt;   &gt; doesn&#39;t sound skeptical anymore .. \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Just a small part of what went on was featured in the show ... \nOne \n&gt;   of \n&gt;   &gt; the other segments had a little boy who sees a girl spirit who \n&gt;   plays \n&gt;   &gt; with the toys in his room. I was speaking to him backstage and \nhis \n&gt;   &gt; stories were amazing! He can&#39;t wait to move. \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%\n40yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , \n&gt;   Lisby\n&gt;   &gt; &lt;lisby@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; Debbie--will the show be available in its entirety online?
