Babs.. I appreciate the need for
validation and your argume=
nt about children and high school kids.  As a
mother that is fully engaged =
in my children=92s school =96 I can
guarantee you that no school in this co=
untry will allow any device in their
school to test.  If parents choose to =
bring their children to a testing
than that will be their decision.. right =
or wrong.  
 

  
 

It seems to me your posts are always
confrontational o=
r at minimum passive aggressive.  Kudos to you for being
a strong person wh=
o will stand up for what you believe in.  But having
read back through all =
your posts I find that you indeed only post messages when
you feel the need=
 to confront people or defend your point of view.  I
think we get it now..
=
 

  
 

So here are your facts:  You strongly
believe only 30 people can d=
o this and anyone who disagrees with this is
wrapped up in their own ego.  =
You feel the minibox is a rip off as well as
the RS hack and that these dev=
ices will possibly bring negative and dark forces
to the rest of us if we a=
ren=92t in perfect harmony with the good. And finally
that Mr. Moon is an u=
p-standing guy whose work and words are at best mis-understood. 

 

  
 

=
Okay we get your point. I for one think there
are many versions of =93the t=
ruth=94. There is yours, mine and theirs. 
Unfortunately they never all mat=
ch up.  I wish you the best of luck in all
your research and development an=
d hope that you will remain a positive outlet
in this field.  I just ask th=
at the next email I read from you has
something positive to add to the rese=
arch.

Absolutely Kristin. As I said, my purpose was to clear
up=
 any

misconceptions about my honesty. I think anyone would have done the

=
same. Although I think it's funny that the truth gets a "can we drop

it no=

replies to my =
post. I know that it will be read and knowing that

maybe, just maybe, some=
one will stop and consider the truth is enough

for me. After all, we are n=
othing if not honest.

Have a great day everyone and get back to work!
