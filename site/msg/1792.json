I put an attenuator on the output of the AM \ntuner, which helps.\n\nIt&#39;s the type of voices that gets to me sometimes, how many times to I have \nlisten to crackhead aliens saying they&#39;re coming to pick up their Purple \nPrincess!?  I think the purpose of EVP is make us nutz! Or maybe I need some \nof Art Bell&#39;s Gray Away Spray!?\n\nFrank-S\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nTease your brain--play Clink!
