<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>AMEN Sister !!!!  The last time i bought a phone the salesman was explaining that it had internet, mp3, video, digital camera...etc.

So i asked him if it rang, because i already have all the other things.  He said they don&#x27;t offer a simple phone that just rings anymore.

&gt; I have that and other ghost hunting apps on my Android. However, the stupid phone has so many apps it&#x27;s hard to use it just for a phone! I just went out and bought a $100.00 jaw bone for it, because it was constantly going off. I wish I had just stuck to my Black Berry.
&gt; 
&gt; I miss the days of when a phone was just a phone and not a ghost meter, video recorder, camera, game consol, answering machine, camera, PC, browser, YouTube uploader,.........

&gt; &gt; &gt; I started a group about Ghost Radar App. If you use it come by and check it
&gt; &gt; &gt; out. I want to be able to share experiences using the new tool.
&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks
