Some know me, some don&#39;t.\n\nI have recently returned to this board with the sole intention of \nhelping all the new people I can., the way I was helped when I got \nstarted. I&#39;m sure if you are reading the posts here, you are aware that \nthere is a bit of friction here between some of us older members.\n\nthat is niether here nor there. The reason for this post is to say \nthat, I have been involved in box research for a while now and have \ndevoted many, many hours to research and helping new peolpe get started.\nI have aquired Rs 470 boxes that where not readily available and made \nthem available to new researchers that could not find or afford one.\n\nI do not want to pat myself on the back, just let all you new people \nthat my experience is notable and available to you whenever you feel \nyou ned some help or have a question.\n\nAnsd I can not stress this enough, any advice or suggestions I give are \nsolely MY OPINION based on my experience in this research.\n\nAnd remember, and this has been stressed here and everywhere all the \ntime. NONE of this is carved in stone and no one really has the true \nanswers just there opinions. And that goes for everyone! including me.\n\nHere is my private e-mail if you would like to contact me off group.\n\nparanormalinvestigating@... this is for anyone to use.\n\nI am also on SKYPE under the contact name bruce halliday If anyone \nwould like to talk in person. My door is alway&#39;s open.\n\nthanks for listening\nBruce"}
