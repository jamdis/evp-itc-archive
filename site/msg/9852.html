Hi Michael, et al.  I'm thinking it won't work because the allophones voice tone and 
enunciation isn't distinct enough for the program to learn recognition (as Aaron 
mentioned).  My father recently tried with a friend to have the program learn his voice, and 
was unable to do so (his voice is deep and can be a little hoarse sounding at times, which 
apparently prevented recognition.)  Let us know what you discover if you try this.
