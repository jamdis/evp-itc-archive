I checked the roster about a month ago and looked interesting if you are a fan of some of the TAPS members who are attending or one of the other guests.\n\nYou live close? I&#39;m not that far from there maybe an hour if I get lost(or 2 lookin for a place to park LOL)\n\nFeeds might be cool depending on what information they are sharing with the public. I may check in to see if they got them up later.\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- On Sat, 7/19/08, kolrone &lt;a.cronk@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: kolrone &lt;a.cronk@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] TAPSCON Clearwater Florida\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, July 19, 2008, 9:42 AM\n&gt; I tried sending this yesterday (Friday), but I guess it\n&gt; didn&#39;t go through. &quot;I know how some people feel\n&gt; about the TAPS guys, but is anyone going to TAPSCON (\n&gt; http://tapscon.com/ ) in Clearwater, Florida this\n&gt; weekend? I can&#39;t make it on Saturday, since I have to\n&gt; work, but I&#39;m thinking about going on Sunday. If you go\n&gt; to the site it has a live feed (which I plan to watch at\n&gt; work) and its venue, etc. There&#39;s going to be all\n&gt; kinds of different stuff, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s\n&gt; worth the money. I think it&#39;d be interesting to go\n&gt; though.&quot;\n&gt;   \n&gt; -Aaron"}
