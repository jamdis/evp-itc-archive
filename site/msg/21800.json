There never was a historical jesus and even credible historians\n&gt;&gt; have written plenty of books tracing its origins so don&#39;t take my proof.\n&gt;&gt; However the otherside does implicate that buddha did exist and is within\n&gt;&gt; their realm.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent via BlackBerry from T-Mobile\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; *From: *&quot;ghosteinstein&quot; &lt;jon.almada@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *Sender: *EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; *Date: *Sun, 24 Jul 2011 14:24:35 -0000\n&gt;&gt; *To: *&lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *ReplyTo: *EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; *Subject: *[EVP-ITC] Re: Amy Winehouse, 3 try,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That is a rather definitive proof you submitted about the existence of\n&gt;&gt; Jesus... lol.
