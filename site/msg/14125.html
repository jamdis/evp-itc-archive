<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>If the steel was the only issue, there is a way around that. 

The Queen Mary is not a submarine: it has upper decks, windows, and areas open to the air.  So if it&#x27;s radio transmissions you need, you&#x27;d just have to make the requirement that you did your thing in an area that wasn&#x27;t too insulated from outside EM.  The ship does have wireless internet installed in all areas from what I hear, but I don&#x27;t know if that helps you.

But I can understand how you would not want to put yourself into a situation where someone might try to perform unplanned testing of the EVP claims.  That would probably be pretty embarrassing for you, and why would you want to go through that?

&gt;  He&#x27;s listed on the Darkness Radio event site. I didn&#x27;t want to name names
&gt; becuase i don&#x27;t trust these dweebs.
&gt; The event was starting to smell already. Then, how is one supposed to get a
&gt; radio signal inside a stewl ship? The debunkers would just say see, it
&gt; doesn&#x27;t work!

&gt; &gt;  I hear ya Frank.... that&#x27;s what makes you so different and interesting.
&gt; &gt; You don&#x27;t want all of this publicity and crap that most NAMES IN THE
&gt; &gt; PARANORMAL field do.
&gt; &gt; And the email I received about the Queen Mary event doesn&#x27;t say who is on
&gt; &gt; the engineer panel
&gt; &gt; that picks the inventions.
&gt; &gt; Who is this debunker on Discovery?  Got a first or last name?
&gt; &gt; Can&#x27;t think of who you are talking about...

&gt; &gt;    I&#x27;m not doing the QM thing, not if they are sneaking in that infamous
&gt; &gt; debunker that Discovery usaully as on.  I don&#x27;t have a vested interest in
&gt; &gt; this paranormnal crap, and I don&#x27;t have to take that darkside sneaky shit!
