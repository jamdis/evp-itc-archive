&gt; That even was suppose to be Mansfied.  But as far as I know there
was  no 
&gt; taping donae at all and definitely NO live broadcast event.  But yes
the  event 
&gt; was billed out as a Paranormal underworld event.

&gt; Well, this guy said there hasn&#x27;t been a live event in over 2 years,
or  any 
&gt; attempt to do one. I just want to know why there&#x27;s an event
scheduled for  July 
&gt; 2008 if that&#x27;s the case.

&gt; That&#x27;s because the site is never updated.  It just sits there  dormant 
&gt; looking stupid.

&gt; The website, www.paranormalunder _world.com_ (http://world.com/)  is
still 
&gt; up, and there  is an
&gt; event advertised that was supposed to take place in July of this  year.
&gt; What&#x27;s up with that?

&gt; &gt; I would like  to make all aware that paranormal underworld no longer
&gt; &gt; exist, nor  dose on line production . This was my creation. I had the
&gt; &gt; idea and ,  brought it to the paranormal community . We have not
done a
&gt; &gt; alive  event in over 2 year. Nor has there been attempt. It was a
&gt; &gt; great  concept. But unfortunately it never took off . I will not have
&gt; &gt; my  name associated with something that boarders on fraud. 
&gt; &gt; I am more  than willing to share the temp plates , and the
&gt; &gt; technology, and what  is needed at the location, and how I set this
&gt; &gt; up for free .I will  gladly explain what server I used, and how to 
&gt; &gt; present a event what  equipment that is required, and how it was
&gt; &gt; promoted , also I will  tell you the problems I ran in to so you can
&gt; &gt; avoid them, as well as  what I enjoyed about this, my experience is at
&gt; &gt; your disposal, all I  ask for is a invite to the event . 
&gt; &gt; If any one is interested you can  contact me at
&gt; &gt; shadow71414@ ... I will do my best to get back to you  in 24
&gt; &gt; hours. Or I am more than willing to give my cell number out  and I do
&gt; &gt; return calls promptly .
