&gt; Believe me when I say that this isn&#x27;t to cause or stir crap. I was
&gt; basically called a liar and this clears up that misconception. If I am
&gt; banned from this group for telling the truth, than so be it.

No one called you a liar, I don&#x27;t think. I believe we said we didn&#x27;t
agree with your verdict that spirit communication harms children, that
there are portals from hell, or that negative entities are a real threat.

&gt; 
&gt; &quot;...it was not the question of whether the phenomenon existed to begin
&gt; with, but rather what is the phenomenon.  That will require a good
&gt; deal more effort to explore and beginning in January we will be
&gt; undertaking test sessions all over north and east Texas as well as
&gt; other national locations with a wide variety of folks to see what
&gt; happens within the group dynamic.  The testing will include folks who
&gt; are both believers and non-believers, skeptics, critics, other
&gt; researchers, children, high school students, college and grad
&gt; students, and senior citizens to name a few categories.&quot;

I don&#x27;t mean to parse--well, okay, yes, I do, but if you actually look
at what is written here, it does not say anywhere that these devices
were going to be taken into schools. I believe &quot;high-school students&quot;
should be read as an age group--like teens. So, this hysteria about
evil, untrue miniboxes being foisted on unsuspecting school kids
intheir classrooms needs to stop. It ain&#x27;t happening and never was.

&gt; Are you willing to &quot;see what happens&quot; with our children?

Exactly whose children are you so worried about? The ones whose
parents will almost certainly let them participate? The idea that the
intent is to do this by stealth is completely unfounded.

I know that I plan to let my kids in on the experiments, if they want
(they might not give a flip) just as my grandmother (a Spiritualist
medium) did for me. I was raised, from birth in an Spiritualist
environment where afterdeath communication was normal. Am I scarred
for life? Nope. More like fascinated for life.

There are lots of kids in the world who are in danger that is a hell
of a lot more real and pressing than the possibility that someone may
show up at their school with a minibox and force them to listen to
dead people. If you want to be fearful, be fearful, but at least do it
about the children who really help.

Can we now close this topic by agreeing to disagree?
