Misty, I have a service plan with Cingular/ATT, but because I didn't purcha=
se this phone through them, and it's not even available anymore, I don't th=
ink they would replace it.  Even if it had a warranty, my name isn't associ=
ated with it, so I'm pretty sure I'm out of luck.  I couldn't seem to get a=
nywhere trying to negotiate the Sony-Ericsson website either, but as that's=
 the manufacturer, I'm going to follow your suggestion and make another att=
empt to see if can be repaired/replaced through them.  

Thanks for calling=
 me on my procrastinating nature!

Robin
