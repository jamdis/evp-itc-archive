It&#39;s like t=\r\nhe psychics again, but with visual aids.\n\n\nI think the reason EVP studies a=\r\nre not securing more interest, as you noted, are a little of both effects. =\r\nFirst is the anthropomorphism problem: I notice many EVP experimenters proc=\r\nlaim what their results sound like, or name the sound file by what they&#39;ve =\r\nheard. But like the creaks, &quot;sounds like&quot; does not equal &quot;is&quot;. This is then=\r\n compounded by the technology backing: regardless of how valid the EVP rese=\r\narcher&#39;s results are, the technology can seem intimidating, but the researc=\r\nhers often proclaim the obviousness of their results. People again become t=\r\nurned off by it because it is not obvious to them, and in the end it is jus=\r\nt another piece of technology presenting sounds, with no obvious connection=\r\n to the paranormal, except by the claims and interpretations of the present=\r\ners.\n\n\nI believe, taking these issues into account, there is a way for EVP =\r\nstudies to garner more interest. For now, the analysis coming from the rese=\r\narchers usually seems like a claim, and it is these claims, imho, that is b=\r\neing classified by the public with the rest of the paranormal claims, and s=\r\no, it also becomes less of an interest. A new approach could be one without=\r\n the claims and interpretations of the investigators, one where the sounds =\r\nare simply played and not labeled.
