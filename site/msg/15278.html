<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I look back in my search results and actually see that I tried to find &quot;sabonika&quot; hanukkah and was given the suggestion &quot;Salonika Hanukkah&quot;. I don&#x27;t know......it does sound like SAVONIKA or SABONIKA to me. But he does say the words fast...... Either way, it is definatly JEWISH :) --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:

&gt;   Uploaded by : clockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt; 
&gt;   Description : Went to Glendale Cemetary today (Des Moines-Iowa) Stopped at two Mausoleums. Got one evp...man said &quot;were dead&quot;, I also went over to the Jewish Burial Site. I asked to have an Elder or someone with an accent to speak so I could have some proof. I get this EVP. It says &quot;Jim &gt;Salonika &lt; Hanukka&quot; Now I&#x27;m NOT positive it says &quot;Solonika&quot; but I tried to use &quot;savonika&quot; (spelled it something like that) and Google gave the Salonika suggestion. But I do know it says &quot;JIM.........HANUKKAH&quot;.
