Hi all, and hope you all had a good Easter!
   
  I keep listening to everyone's recordings and since they are clips of what you are doing, my question is how do each of you start a recording to even get these responses?
   
  I write procedures and education instruction, and I am missing this piece.
   
  So you pull out the radio
  You plug in the external speaker
  You turn the radio on
  Then set the recorder to record
  But how do you start the recording?
   
  I mean, do you start off by saying, "hi everyone this is Bruce, or Kristn or Rhonda. Is anyone one there?"  Or do you start calling out names, or do you even pray the night before that you plan to turn the radio on at 9am on such and such a date, or is it when you turn it on they are waiting for you?
   
  Also lets say you turn the radio on, and a spirit says hi Rhonda!. From there what is your response? What types of questions do you ask? 
   
  Is it more like a phone call to a family member, friend, or even just talking on a CB radio to truckers passing by trying to learn who they are etc.....
   
  I am trying to step out a method for myself and it is frustrating me that I dont have a plan when I turn that rradio and recorder on.
   
  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!
