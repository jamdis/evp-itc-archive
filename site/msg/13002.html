<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>hey guys. im glad to be part of a group like this. my husband had 
joined a bit ago and didnt have the time so i kinda got the &quot;to do&quot; 
list. this being the first on the list. we have been doing much work 
with evps and some itc. the odd thing is i truly have come to belive 
that women and men hear at different frequencys. some times the 
recording we have the two of us hear compleatly different words and 
when played for others its the same (same sex hears same words) and 
most of the time i can pick out things that he dosent even hear. to be 
honest i thought i was going crazy at first.....then i would play it 
for others. i would like to know if anyone else had had this same 
result. the other thing i had on my list was posting some evp/itc 
online. i have tried esnips and it has become a HUGE pain. dose anyone 
have suggestions. thank you all for your time in reading this and i 
hope to post again.
