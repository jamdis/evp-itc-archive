On our way back we stopped at a Truck Stop so some could use the restroom.            I went over to the picnic tables and then soon walked up to a big rock while recording for possible EVP&#39;s. I didn&#39;t think I would have much luck.  \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jim%27s%20RR-DR60%20EVP%27s/BLESS_YOU-Original%20Audio-evp.wav \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/forms/general.htmlfiles\n\nRegards,\n\nclockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt;"}
