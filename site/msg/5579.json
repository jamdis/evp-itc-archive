EVPmaker is what they started calling me \nKiera on back in 2001, and it&#39;s getting cloudy here as a winter storm \ncomes in.  EVPmaker has the advantage of clear, albeit distorted \naudio. The distortion is from the chopping of the raw audio, and can \nbe controlled by the size, or chop rate. In this case the raw audio \nis an old school board meeting stored as a wave file. I don&#39;t jack \naround with the sound like some do with EVPmaker, I just let it do \nit&#39;s job. The way some use the program is very bizarre and \npuzzling.
