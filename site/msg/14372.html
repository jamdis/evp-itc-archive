<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve noticed this type of message is a constant theme within EVP transmissions.

I am intrigued by the &quot;robotic&quot; voice, this could support the holographic universe theory:

I think it&#x27;s worth approaching this field with a mind to helping those requesting assitance. 


But what does helping mean ? 
Perhaps  prayer or for those of an agnostic nature postive thoughts focused on the recipent do have a tangeble effect,  our &quot;materialistic&quot; nature may give a form of heavy duty thought energy which for those on the other side can effect &quot;real world&quot; benefit.

&gt; Not to get all religious but do you folks have a prayer to say for some of  
&gt; these people?  It must be that The Man Upstairs has given us all a job to  
&gt; do here, that&#x27;s probably the reason He has allowed these groups to hear the  
&gt; other side.  :&gt;/ or something. sf

&gt; You could pray for that female spirit. Sometimes just knowing that  they 
&gt; are not be alone helps.

&gt; One last question before I got to bed after 1am :) What are those noises  
&gt; often heard before or after an EVP? I have found quite a few voices that I  
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t have noticed hadn&#x27;t I first heard a &quot;pop&quot; sound. Actually had to do  
&gt; some MAJOR enhancing on 2 of them to even hear them at all. I mean one was  
&gt; impossibly buried in the noise. But after slowing it down I got a &quot;wiff&quot; of 
&gt;  it, and through more passes of the Audacity effects I was rewarded with a  
&gt; female voice. It was sad though...she said in a mechanical pattern &quot;can - 
&gt; you  - help- me.........please - help. Still, the audio is so painfully low.  
&gt; Hearing her plea will forever effect me. Hopefully I can find someoneone 
&gt; here  that can hear them as well as I. That can verify this for me :) I hear  
&gt; it...but is nice to know someone else is there with you :) I went back to 
&gt; that  location little over an hour later (after found the voice) Is under 1 
&gt; mile  from me. It&#x27;s a real sad thing to hear and not knowing what to do.Jim H
