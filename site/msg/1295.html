<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I know, I am new to this as it is.
I have tried many methods, but not on the computer (yet), and not the 
sweep tuning method. I really want to try it out.

Can someone with a little time explain it to me, in detail?
I need to know from the very beginning...because I don&#x27;t get how you 
guys are doing it.

I have &#x27;Audacity&#x27; on my comp, haven&#x27;t used it yet.
I usually just use my oldie recorders.  
I have a regular cassette recorder from years ago w/ built in mic, and 
a super oldie reel to reel w/ mic too.
I also have a digital recorder...tiny handheld Panasonic RR-QR160.

Any help would be greatly appreciated to get me started.
As soon as I get going I can post what I get.

Thanks,  Laura</pre>
