<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Iowa county reverses vote on ghost hunters in mental asylum

FROM ASSOCIATED PRESS

IOWA CITY, Iowa  The Johnson County Board of Supervisors has changed
its mind about allowing a paranormal team to look for ghosts at a
one-time mental asylum.

Board members last month approved an investigation of the buildings,
but decided to vote it down in response to negative feedback, said
Board Chairman Rod Sullivan.

He said the board initially did not oppose a request from the Johnson
County Historical Society to have a paranormal team conduct a free
investigation at the site, which is now a private residential care
facility for the mentally ill called Chatham Oaks.

Chatham Oaks officials were among those opposed.

``I think the rules have changed a bit because Chatham Oaks stepped
up,&#x27;&#x27; said board member Terrence Neuzil. ``Obviously, the cards have
changed a bit.&#x27;&#x27;

Historical society officials said the controversy began in March when
they passed along a request from the Carroll Area Paranormal Team to
do a scientific study of the site. The team planned to spend one night
at the site to look for paranormal activity, using equipment such as
thermal imaging cameras and voice recording systems.

Brandon Cochran, museum operations assistant for the historical
society, said one of the most common questions from people touring the
153-year-old poor farm is whether it&#x27;s haunted. Cochran said he had
hoped the study would end all the speculation.
