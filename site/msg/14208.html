Code 7 is either code for being out of service (short for 10-7), or a meal=

      Tonight at work I was talking to a state trooper, there had been an=
 accident. I asked him if there were any deaths (it was very very bad) and =
he said he didnt know so he got on his radio and called in and asked them i=
f it was a 7 at the site. They told him negative, and he told me the little=
 boy who was the worst off was still alive. I asked him why did you ask the=
m if it was a 7. He said code 7, I was asking them if they were dead. So if=
 you ever hear anyone call 7 over the radio that means someones dead.

ust thought I would pass that on. I find it interesting since I know alot o=
f us have heard this before when used to describe who is speaking rather th=
an a name they say seven.
