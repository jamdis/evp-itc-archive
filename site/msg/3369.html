<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce I tend to agree with on everything you just stated. I cherish my
FB and even though I must choose the location carefully with it it&#x27;s
the messages that come through that make it profound. But the Shack
Hack is an important development, the timing of it is ironic
considering other recent Box developments.

&gt; HEY GUY&#x27;S 
&gt; 
&gt; OF COURSE I HAVE MY RS HACK AND GETTING RESULTS THE FIRST DAY.
&gt; MY INITIAL OPINION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS LITTLE GEM IS FROM TWO 
&gt; EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS ONE PERFORMED BY STEVE HULTAY AND MYSELF AND 
&gt; THE OTHER BY MYSELF ALONE. THE FILES I HAVE POSTED ARE GLEENED FROM 
&gt; ONLY THE FIRST MINUTE OR SO OF A TEN MINUTE RECORDING.PLEASE TAKE A 
&gt; MINUTE TO LISTEN AND POST YOUR FEEDBACK.
&gt; 
&gt; THE FILES ARE POSTED IN THE FILE SECTION UNDER: 
&gt; 
&gt; 11-26-07_radio shack hack files_Bruce 
&gt; 
&gt; AFTER DOING ONLY ONE RECORDED SESSION AND TWO SESSIONS TOTAL. I AS A 
&gt; SERIOUS BOX RESEARCHER WITH EVRYDAY EXPERIMENTING ON FRANK&#x27;S,JOE&#x27;S 
&gt; AND NOW THE RADIO SHACK HACK BOX CAN PREMATURELY SAY THAT THIS RADIO 
&gt; MAY BE SMALL IN SIZE BUT IT PACKS A BIG PUNCH ! AND IT WAS UNDER OUR 
&gt; VERY NOSES ALL THE TIME. THANKS TO SUM DUC FOR HIS INSIGHT IN 
&gt; DISCOVERING IT.
&gt; 
&gt; AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING REDUNDENT I MUST REITERATE THIS RS BOX WILL 
&gt; HOLD IT&#x27;S OWN WITH THE BIG BOYS. THE RESULTS AND LEVEL OF 
&gt; COMMUNICATION BOTH IN REAL TIME DURING A SESSION AND WHAT IS MISSED 
&gt; BY OUR RUDIMENTARY HUMAN HEARING AND CAUGHT ON A RECORDING RIVALS OR 
&gt; MAY EVEN GIVEN ENOUGH TIME FOR FREQUENCY IMPRINTING BY OUR SPIRIT 
&gt; FRIENDS AND PROPER RESEARCH METHODS WILL SURPASS JOE&#x27;S BOX AND PULL A 
&gt; CLOSE SECOND TO FRANK&#x27;S BOX. 
&gt; 
&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE RS BOX WAS REMINICENT 
&gt; OF THE AM LINEAR MODE OF MY FRANKS BOX #12. LET&#x27;S FACE IT A FRANKS 
&gt; BOX IS A FRANKS BOX IN AS NO TWO ARE EXACTLY THE SAME THAT IS WHAT 
&gt; MAKES THEM SO UNIQUE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT I BELIEVE A SMALL PART OF 
&gt; FRANK HIMSELF TRANSFERS INTO EVERY BOX HE MAKES AND HE IS VERY WELL 
&gt; RESPECTED ON THE OTHER SIDE FROM WHAT MY GUIDES AND TECHS TELL ME.
&gt; 
&gt; I HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE RON RICKETS MINI BOX YET BUT I 
&gt; AM HEARING VERY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT&#x27;S PERFORMANCE ALSO AND CAN NOT 
&gt; WAIT TO EXPERIMENT WITH IT.
&gt; 
&gt; I THINK OUR FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE FINALY DECIDING TO PUSH 
&gt; FORWARD WITH THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS AND ALLOW IT TO BECOME 
&gt; ACCESABLE TO MANY MORE PEOPLE. WHAT THEY HAVE CONVEYED TO ME OVER 
&gt; NUMEROUS SESSIONS IS THE DESPERATE AND INTRIGAL NEED FOR COMBINED 
&gt; HARMONY AMONG RESEARCHERS AND COMMUNICATORS. THE MORE MINDS THAT ARE 
&gt; THINKING AND MOVING TOGETHER FOR THIS COMMON GOAL THE STRONGER THE 
&gt; SPIRITS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE AND THEY WILL HELP WITH DEVELOPE MENT 
&gt; OF THE TECHNOLOGY SO THINGS ARE LOOKING UP AND HEADING TO THE FUTURE. 
&gt; 
&gt; WHAT I HAVE GATHERED OVER MANY SESSIONS IS THEY DEFINATELY WANT THE 
&gt; WORD AND THE TECHNOLOGY SPREAD TO AS MANY AS ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT IT 
&gt; WITH AN OPEN MIND. I AM RATTLING ON AND HAVE DRIFTED FROM MY ORIGINAL 
&gt; POINT WHICH WAS, THIS RADIO SHACK BOX IS AND WILL BE A VERY IMPORTANT 
&gt; AND USEFULL TOOL IN FURTHERING OUR COMMUNICATION PROCESS.
&gt; 
&gt; THANKS FOR LISTENING.
&gt; 
&gt; BRUCE
