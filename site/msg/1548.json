I had this vision in my head that \n&gt;you were doing some new age, melodramatic ritual over the box to infuse it \n&gt;with some kind of magical energy. All you were doing is making our spirit \n&gt;colleagues aware of your presence and intentions to use the box.\n&gt;\n&gt;We did the same sort of thing with a statement of intent and introduction.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanx for the feedback,\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank R.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nhttp://newlivehotmail.com"}
