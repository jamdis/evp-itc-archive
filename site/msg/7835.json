Posted by: &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; lcdupla@... lcduplaDate: Wed Mar 12,\n2008 1:16 pm ((PDT)) Frank S., thanks for uploading the files. Very\ninteresting sounds and idea. Could definitely provide the means for\nvery clear communication.  I am assuming that you are trying to\nproduce random sounds and see if they can be manipulated into words,\nor do you have another idea on how they can choose the specific sounds\nnecessary to create words, kinda&#39; like some cosmic typewriter? ;) LC&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  No, it&#39;s a comic typewritter! Just kidding. Yeah, I trying to see\nif I can radnomly access the chip, make it output speech bits and\nother sounds to be used as the raw audio for ghost voices. It&#39;s just\nthe start of the project. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Connect and share in new ways with Windows Live.\n&gt;\nhttp://www.windowslive.com/share.html?ocid=TXT_TAGHM_Wave2_sharelife_012008\n&gt;"}
