Thanks again for everyone who participated! I admire your courage and =
 
motivation to try different methods, see what works, and try to improve  =

everyone's understanding of EVP-ITC.

If you recall, on 7/10/2010 I  place=
d an object on top of my computer 
monitor, right in front of me, and left =
 it there until today, 7/14/2010, noon 
Denver time. The experiment was for=
  participants to determine what it was. 
Vague or partial answers wouldn't=
 be  counted (for example, just colors, 
shapes, sizes, what it's made of, =
etc):  we're looking for what it is. 
Participants could use their ghost bo=
xes, EVP  recorders, or I suppose any other means 
they chose.

In order to=
 keep me  honest, I took a picture of the object at the start of 
the exper=
iment and  loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this 
group. If yo=
u can follow  the link, it is here:

_http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EV=
P-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip_ 
(http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-=
ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip) 

The  idea was that you could download the=
 file at the beginning of the 
test, and  'keep it safe' on your computer. =
Then at the end of the test, I would 
release  the password so you could re=
veal the contents of the file. That 
way, you were  in control of the origi=
nal image during the entire test, not 
me. 

The  password for that file is=
: 123BlastOff
Instructions, if you need them, are  also in that RJ folder.
=

And if you did not care to download the zip  file before the test, I will =

post the final image there too.

So to the  results:

Number of participan=
ts: 5
Total tries: 8
Ambiguous  answers: 0
Correct answers: 0

Object: A ra=
dio
Uzipped  picture:

RJ.20100710.1.JPG_ 
(http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ=
.20100710.1.JPG) 

So  what do the results mean? All that we can really agr=
ee on from this 
experiment  is that no participant, with whatever theories=
 or methods or 
technology they  used, was able to correctly determine the =
object. We can't say 
those theories  or methods or technologies never work=
. Just as we can't say 
they do. Just  that, for whatever reason, they did =
not work this time. Readers 
can take the  results, use them to improve or =
change their methods, or keep 
doing what  they're doing.

If anyone has an=
y observations, comments, or ideas for  improvement, let me 
know. I hope t=
o get a new experiment up and running soon.  Since there 
wasn't much parti=
cipation Mon-Wed, I think the next experiment  will be arranged 
to mostly =
span the weekends.

Again, thanks to everyone  who participated in this fir=
st experiment.
