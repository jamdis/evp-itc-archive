&gt; Well, our main goal here is to research and share. It looks like our 
sharing is having a big impact, with a major player in the field of

&gt; Stephen Wagner writes about Paranormal Phenomena for the very popular 
website, About.com. In an article he wrote yesterday, he tells his 
readers about the Radio Shack Hack. Steve even went out and bought a 
12-470 and hacked it!
