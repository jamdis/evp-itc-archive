I suppos=\r\ne one route is to, as you suggest, just walk away from all this.  I guess y=\r\nou have to look at the big picture and decide if it&#39;s worth the frustration=\r\n, the stress, and the angst, especially what it does to your health.  Nothi=\r\nng is worth throwing your health away over.  \n\n            Even dropping al=\r\nl this, just for a while, might also tell you if any health problems you ar=\r\ne experiencing might be being aggravated by all the drama.  And it might ha=\r\nve the side effect of letting all the negativity and egos out there burn th=\r\nemselves out, so if you do look back into things a while down the road, it =\r\ncould be a prettier picture then.\n\n            Other than a full retreat, I=\r\n don&#39;t think anything else would make a difference other than a full attack=\r\n: creating, for  instance, good objective standards for evaluation and test=\r\n of the technology and results, which the shows and &#39;experts&#39; seem to find =\r\nanathema.  Then, if their claims were to be confronted by such standards, t=\r\nhey&#39;d find themselves unable to stand up to them, and eventually, hopefully=\r\n, be embarrassed back into obscurity.\n\n\n\n\n            --- On Mon, 4/6/09, F=\r\nrank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n              From: Fran=\r\nk Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n              Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC]=\r\n Re: Is pride so wrong!?\n              To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n        =\r\n      Date: Monday, April 6, 2009, 2:40 PM\n\n\n\n               Yeah, it&#39;s for=\r\n that reason that it&#39;s very tempting to walk away from all things paranorma=\r\nl.

You seem to have put alot of thought and time into t=\r\nhat. \n\n                         What really bothers me is the self proclaim=\r\ned experts out there that take all evidence and experience and try to make =\r\nit negative, and evil.

Too bad the =\r\ninterest in EVP doesn&#39;t pick up while that ghost hunting mentality drops of=\r\nf. I keep saying, you&#39;ll get better, more consistent, and more meaningful m=\r\nessages if you record at home. The ghosts, spirits and entities can and do =\r\ntravel. You also have to listen to the recordings more than once. \n        =\r\n                  &gt; \n                          &gt; Frank\n\n                   =\r\n       That is an interesting observation. I think the core of the issue is=\r\n that there seems to be a `sweet spot&#39; in paranormal beliefs where there is=\r\n just enough science, just enough technical backing, just enough paranormal=\r\n claims, and just enough indefinite evidence that keeps people interested i=\r\nn the ghost hunting mentality\n\n                          Evidence which bec=\r\nomes too indefinite turns off most people. As they become more aware of sen=\r\nsitives who simply make claims (&quot;I feel there is a GHOST here!&quot;), but provi=\r\nde no evidence other than statements, people eventually get bored. Similarl=\r\ny, people eventually grow tired of the anthropomorphism of every little occ=\r\nurrence in a house: a creak implies a footstep, which implies a person, whi=\r\nch, if not seen, implies a ghost. But a creak does not equal a footstep.\n\n =\r\n                         And while this kind of indefinite evidence can los=\r\ne an audience, so can evidence that is claimed to be &quot;obviously&quot; evident by=\r\n technology. Here, the investigator is no longer making vague claims, but w=\r\naving science around, like FLIR cameras, or EMF meters, and then making pro=\r\nclamations of the results. But again, people eventually see these are just =\r\nlights and sounds from electronics, and investigators making more claims. I=\r\nt&#39;s like the psychics again, but with visual aids.\n\n                       =\r\n   I think the reason EVP studies are not securing more interest, as you no=\r\nted, are a little of both effects. First is the anthropomorphism problem: I=\r\n notice many EVP experimenters proclaim what their results sound like, or n=\r\name the sound file by what they&#39;ve heard. But like the creaks, &quot;sounds like=\r\n&quot; does not equal &quot;is&quot;. This is then compounded by the technology backing: r=\r\negardless of how valid the EVP researcher&#39;s results are, the technology can=\r\n seem intimidating, but the researchers often proclaim the obviousness of t=\r\nheir results. People again become turned off by it because it is not obviou=\r\ns to them, and in the end it is just another piece of technology presenting=\r\n sounds, with no obvious connection to the paranormal, except by the claims=\r\n and interpretations of the presenters.\n\n                          I believ=\r\ne, taking these issues into account, there is a way for EVP studies to garn=\r\ner more interest. For now, the analysis coming from the researchers usually=\r\n seems like a claim, and it is these claims, imho, that is being classified=\r\n by the public with the rest of the paranormal claims, and so, it also beco=\r\nmes less of an interest. A new approach could be one without the claims and=\r\n interpretations of the investigators, one where the sounds are simply play=\r\ned and not labeled. The interpretation of the data could be left to the lis=\r\nteners. Web sites which present EVPs could be developed where people could =\r\nnot see others interpretations until they entered their own. I think this w=\r\nould be such a novel approach, that it would give the public a better feeli=\r\nng of true involvement in the research, and feel less like they are simply =\r\nbeing exposed to the claims of others. And I think that feeling of involvem=\r\nent is what is needed to reignited the public interest here.\n\n\n\n           =\r\n          \n\n\n\n           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_0140_01C9B77C.B67B9570\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18702&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;OMG Zack!!

As they \n                          become more aware of=\r\n sensitives who simply make claims \n                          (&quot;I feel ther=\r\ne is a GHOST here!&quot;), but provide no \n                          evidence ot=\r\nher than statements, people eventually get \n                          bored=\r\n. Similarly, people eventually grow tired of the \n                         =\r\n anthropomorphism of every little occurrence in a \n                        =\r\n  house: a creak implies a footstep, which implies a \n                     =\r\n     person, which, if not seen, implies a ghost. But a \n                  =\r\n        creak does not equal a footstep.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And while this \n           =\r\n               kind of indefinite evidence can lose an audience, so \n      =\r\n                    can evidence that is claimed to be &quot;obviously&quot; evident =\r\n\n                          by technology. Here, the investigator is no long=\r\ner \n                          making vague claims, but waving science aroun=\r\nd, like \n                          FLIR cameras, or EMF meters, and then ma=\r\nking \n                          proclamations of the results. But again, pe=\r\nople \n                          eventually see these are just lights and so=\r\nunds from \n                          electronics, and investigators making =\r\nmore claims. \n                          It&#39;s like the psychics again, but w=\r\nith visual \n                          aids.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I think the reason EVP s=\r\ntudies are not \n                          securing more interest, as you no=\r\nted, are a little of \n                          both effects. First is the =\r\nanthropomorphism problem: I \n                          notice many EVP expe=\r\nrimenters proclaim what their \n                          results sound like=\r\n, or name the sound file by what \n                          they&#39;ve heard. =\r\nBut like the creaks, &quot;sounds like&quot; does \n                          not equa=\r\nl &quot;is&quot;. This is then compounded by the \n                          technolog=\r\ny backing: regardless of how valid the EVP \n                          resea=\r\nrcher&#39;s results are, the technology can seem \n                          int=\r\nimidating, but the researchers often proclaim the \n                        =\r\n  obviousness of their results. People again become \n                      =\r\n    turned off by it because it is not obvious to them, \n                  =\r\n        and in the end it is just another piece of technology \n            =\r\n              presenting sounds, with no obvious connection to the \n       =\r\n                   paranormal, except by the claims and interpretations \n  =\r\n                        of the presenters.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I believe, taking these \n=\r\n                          issues into account, there is a way for EVP studi=\r\nes to \n                          garner more interest. For now, the analysi=\r\ns coming \n                          from the researchers usually seems like=\r\n a claim, and \n                          it is these claims, imho, that is =\r\nbeing classified by \n                          the public with the rest of =\r\nthe paranormal claims, and \n                          so, it also becomes l=\r\ness of an interest. A new \n                          approach could be one =\r\nwithout the claims and \n                          interpretations of the in=\r\nvestigators, one where the \n                          sounds are simply pla=\r\nyed and not labeled. The \n                          interpretation of the d=\r\nata could be left to the \n                          listeners. Web sites wh=\r\nich present EVPs could be \n                          developed where people=\r\n could not see others \n                          interpretations until they=\r\n entered their own. I think \n                          this would be such a=\r\n novel approach, that it would \n                          give the public a=\r\n better feeling of true involvement \n                          in the resea=\r\nrch, and feel less like they are simply \n                          being ex=\r\nposed to the claims of others. And I think \n                          that =\r\nfeeling of involvement is what is needed to \n                          reig=\r\nnited the public interest here.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                         =\r\n &lt;DIV \n                        style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;=\r\n&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                &lt;DIV \n              style=3D&quot;COLOR: =\r\nwhite&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQU=\r\nOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n    &lt;=\r\nP&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n    &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot; \n  width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End group e=\r\nmail --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0140_01C9B77C.B67B9570--"}
