For the past couple years I&#39;ve been using\nmostly what I call direct mode, or no echo chamber. When I use an aluminum\nfoil chamber I seem to get more ET types, and that&#39;s what I used to get &quot;we\ncome from the 6th planet&quot; years ago.\n\n A very large echo chamber can have a dramatic effect, like 12 inches\nsquare, and 4 feet long. I made one that size out of MDF board and lined it\nwiht aluminum foil, the voices were so demonic sounding that I took it\napart. Later I found that if something works, you tend to get the negative\nguys to try to scare you away from it.\n\n F-S\n\nOn Sat, May 15, 2010 at 8:33 PM, &lt;dc3644@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So in building a Frank&#39;s Box is it essential to use an echo chamber?
