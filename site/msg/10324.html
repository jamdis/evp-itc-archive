Hi frank,
 
Weird stuff I am use too and I welcome very much.  It just means I  have 
reached someone or something and they want me to know they are there.   I love it 
when that happens.

Good  Jeff! You are finding a resonance with another researcher. Your contact 
fields  are joining. This is the resonance you read about from the first 
contacts of  the 80's and 90's that is so hard to maintain. Its hard to maintain 
not just  because differences in opinion or arguments but also your "paths" may 
join for  only a while and then split as you seek your different destinations 
(so to  speak). 

I write about this like I know because I have shared these  same connections 
with a few select members of this group and we get messages  all the time for 
each other and messages for those they are connected to  beyond me. You begin 
to see depth of the spiritual network. As the bond gets  stronger, stranger 
things may happen so don't get caught off guard. I'm not  talking about scary 
stuff, just weird stuff that makes you stop in your tracks  and think,"Whoa"I wri

Regards,

Frank R.

Hi Frank,
 
You are absolutely right.  I  have a woman who works for me who is intrigued 
by all of this.  I started  to do a few box sessions with her and have great 
results.  She says she  doesn't hear a lot of things but a lot of things she 
does hear.  And now  she says she is a believer.  And once she made that 
statement we reached  a different plain of all religious ramblings and singing.  This 
is  something new for me but when I am with her doing this that is all we get 
 mixed in with messages.  We have gotten some great results and then they  
start singing to us and it is all good communication.  Think I will keep  her 
around for more sessions.
 
Jeff

Look, if you look around it won't take long  before you find this type of 
hate laden speech. It stems from fear and  misunderstanding. It is invited by 
those who seek validation. You can  explain to them your ideas till your blue in 
the face and they still won't  get it.

My point is, don't try to convince the unconvincible. Seek  people of like 
mind and spiritual nature and you can't go wrong. I remember  reading this blog 
among others and I have to say, I am not impressed by  their logic or 
argument. Follow your own path.

Regards,

Frank  R.

That  was the very point with my previous post I was trying make!  But little 
 old me knows nothing, hummmm!
 
I  guess Frank is the only one who people choose not to listen to.  Maybe  he 
is a wise old owl (no pund intended Frank on the old part,  lol).
