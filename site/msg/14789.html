I figured out how to upload them to this group, the two files are in the  
listing under my screen name then in the Ft Mifflin folder.

I will give a short explaination of what and where we were conducting the  
RS hack session.  It was in the small artillery armory building at Fort  
Mifflin.  Present were myself, a cameraman Greg, sound person Crystal,  and the 
person they are talking about "Bobbi".  She is a medium or  pyschic.  She 
can read people and has proven to me that she can.
 
THe only voice on this segment from the living was her's saying "is that  
me?" the rest were unexplainable voices not from anybody in the room with  
us.  I feel this is a good catch on our first night using the thing  
considering our ears and mindset weren't trained yet with this new tool.
 
please let me know what you think.  I am having a hard time  convincing my 
other teammates.
 
Thanks
Eric (ejspinn)

Attach it to your post like you would  attach a file to an email. But I 
think you have to do it via email, and not  directly to the board.

Hello everyone I am a member of Peace of Mind Paranormal Society here in  
Pittsburgh, PA

We just recently investigated Fort Mifflin. I made a  Radio-shak hack with 
directions from UFOgeek's videos. This was our first  attepmt with it. How 
or where would i upload the wav file for you guys to  take a listen.

I am having a hard time getting some of our more  skeptical members to buy 
into the ITC-EVP ghost box stuff. I am convinced  with everything i seen and 
read about Frank and all his work to what i saw  on Youtube etc...

please  respond
