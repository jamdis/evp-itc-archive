You&#x27;ll probably get a lot of different responses as to favorites but I&#x27;ve 
been very happy with the Olympus VN-960PC I got a few years ago. It comes 
with a USB cable that plugs into your computer.

It will record 6 hours in hi-quality mode.

Radio Shack sells newer versions like the VN-4100PC which probably have 
more recording time than you will ever need on a single investigation.

Some other Olympus models actually allow you to use the flash memory built 
in for storing and transferring data via the USB port.  The VN-XXXPC 
series only allow you to download the recordings you&#x27;ve made to your PC. 
I might consider getting one of the fancier ones some day. Check out the 
Radio Shack website for further details. But I think they all use built-in 
flash and don&#x27;t use separate CF or SD cards.

&gt; Hi Al,
&gt; Do you know if there is a digital voice recorder that has an SD card slot? That would be nice to switch SD cards from time to time. Especially if one had a great EVP.
&gt; How does listening to EVP&#x27;s make you feel about the dead? This is not meant to be a theological argument in any way. Just a question...I am a medium, and I approach the subject as a medium. But then I am involved with being a medium daily.
&gt;
&gt; Al, thank YOU for your honest and kind reply. I appreciate your taking the time out of your busy day to reply to me. The time and effort does not make typing easy for you.
&gt; Blessings,

&gt;
&gt; Al, this is the other Al, heh. I like the Olympus and have three of them and one Sony. IMHO the Olympus beats Sony hands down. Model WS-300M is my favorite. I believe it runs 24-hours -- I use it for overnight evps in houses and have captured very clear sounds. It is stereo and snaps apart to convert into a memory stick complete with usb. You can store data/text files and music, and the tiny speaker is excellent. This thing is so light a good Cuban cigar weighs more. I believe these go for $150 or so, but I got this one new on ebay for $65. Another good one I use all the time is Olympus VN-960PC, which may not be in mfg. any more. It records about 16 hours and is slightly larger, but has a darn good mike and I like the clip for the shirt pocket. Also it has a lighted display (as does the ws-300m) thhat&#x27;s larger than the other one, consequently with bigger figures for easier reading. You didn&#x27;t ask for this, but the one I&#x27;d avoid is the Sony icd-st25. The sound is nowhere near true and though it has most of the features of the Olympus models the sound quality is first in my book. I think all of these are available at wally world, costco, and circuit city, though you can usually save a lot at ebay if you&#x27;re patient.
