Who got sick during the session.  EMF levels were off the hook there with a weird pulsing of EMF on 4 k2 meters all at same time. But the radio kept saying his name was Nate.  We get a couple cuss words, a few short sentances. I didn&#39;t upload it yet but the box went around the table saying are names in order it was kinda neat.\n\nIs it easier to view them there on Youtube or upload them here and take up space?  Let me know.  Most everybody knows how to navigate youtube and if your on several yahoo groups (like most of us) it&#39;s easier to just link them to there instead or uploading the same files several times?"}
