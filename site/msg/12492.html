EVP-ITC] Re: The Ghost Box, is training required?


obviously steve, you fa=
il to remember when just a week ago i had to
apologize to you for asking yo=
u a question that i had no idea you and
the other person did not speak? i w=
as only interested in the
technology and furthering itc research. but i gue=
ss that one question
came across too smug.

you said to black bear that he =
doesn't know you he dislikes you. I
don't think that is the case at all. i =
still don't have a problem with
you either. all i ever wanted to do is talk=
 about the research you
were doing.

I now have 2 frank's boxes (the GHOSTM=
AN 3 and FB#33) to do my
research. (btw.. i thanks you a bunch already fran=
k.. so thank you again)

Steve, you come across as an expert is all i am sa=
ying. that is why i
contacted you. "boxmaster estraordinaire" is it? For yo=
u to say "who
is this guy?" and cause problems for a mutual friend is absur=
d. so..
for you and everyone to know a little about me...

oct 22 i turn 33=
 years old. I have been interested in the box
technology for a few years no=
w. i have been doing paranormal
investigations for 19 years now and took a =
3 year break (which is when
you popped up on the scene.) Now i'm back and h=
itting it hard again
and want to be able to use the best equipment that mon=
ey can't buy.

Frank doesn't even pretend to be an expert nor does he expec=
t his name
to be mentioned every time an article is published. anyways.. i
=
probably said more than i should have already.

bear... i'm up for that due=
l.. sounds fun...lol best one wins a
"certificate of expertification" sign =
by the us president... lol

btw.. one rule bear... no cutting and pasting c=
lips together to make
one up. haha
