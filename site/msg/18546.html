<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank , thanks again for your answers , i have another question , i need to know what is the range of frecuencies of triangle wave , i know its variable, but , what is the common range , like lower frecuencie ,and max frecuencie? .... for example when the pot is totally right turned , the frecuencie min is .....
and when the pot is totally left turned , the frecuencie is ...

&gt;  I make the triangle sweep adjustable so I can cover the entire AM or FM
&gt; band. Some tuners have different sweep requirements for each band, so
&gt; sometimes have to add a pot to adjust the max level for one of the bands.
&gt; AM=530 to 1710 Khz and FM 88.5 to 108mhz, but you don&#x27;t have to cover the
&gt; entire band, all that is required is enough to provide the raw audio bits
&gt; the entities use to make their voices.
&gt; 
&gt;  A Danish researcher back in the 80s was just &quot;wobbling&quot; between a couple
&gt; stations to make contact. His name was Stein and there&#x27;s more info on the
&gt; German VTF site. Stein also has his sweep circuit there.
&gt; 
&gt;  The best sounding systems seem to be the way Steve Hultay makes his, by
&gt; adding sweep to a complete radio. see keyportparanormal.com. I take the
&gt; tuners out of the radio, and supply my own amplifier and sweep. At present
&gt; I&#x27;m making a box using a Timex clock radio tuner, the triangle sweep, and
&gt; computer sound amplifier and speaker system for the bass response. I just
&gt; started this project yesterday. I use Timex model T309T AM/FM/nature sounds
&gt; clock radios when I can find them in thrift stores cheap. I found a Timex
&gt; model T313T this morning, and hoping it has the seperate tuner board inside,
&gt; as the 300 series has so far.
&gt; 
&gt;  I used to use car stereo tuner modules, but those tend to be too noisy. Box
&gt; 13, that Hultay just got back is based on a car tuner. He did a YouTube
&gt; video of it.
&gt; 
&gt;  I&#x27;m still pretty much an amateur at this, there are so many variables.

&gt; &gt; I am very glad for your atention Frank , i will make a box and i need it be
&gt; &gt; very good , for best results . So , your answer says to me the diferents
&gt; &gt; results take origin by materials , not much the dimensions , isnt it? .
&gt; &gt; Another important question , what is the range of frecuencies of the
&gt; &gt; triangle wave ? I know about the model of radio determine that , but what is
&gt; &gt; the common range ? ... hz? , khz? ...

&gt; &gt; &gt; Aluminum seems to work the best. I got a voice that sounded like Raudive
&gt; &gt; &gt; saying copper. I have used plastic and wood. Different materials seem to
&gt; &gt; &gt; allow different levels, but it&#x27;s hard to tell for sure who/what is
&gt; &gt; talking.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Folding the tube seems to make it act like a larger tube. With just a
&gt; &gt; long
&gt; &gt; &gt; straight tube the sound tends to be tinny. I made a chamber 12 inches
&gt; &gt; square
&gt; &gt; &gt; and 4 feet long from MDF board lined with aluminum foil years ago, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; voices were almost demonic sounding, so I took it apart.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The only difference with the hacked radio is the sweep. With the hack
&gt; &gt; radio
&gt; &gt; &gt; the sweep steps so the radio is tuned in 10khz increments. With the box
&gt; &gt; it&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; a continuous sweep, linear uses a triangle wave.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok Frank , thanks for your answer , but , what material you recommend
&gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the best results? , what is the diferent whith the long of tubes in
&gt; &gt; results
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ? and could you say a hacked radio produce the iddentical results like
&gt; &gt; a box
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; built ? (considering echo in box)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#x27;s just a chamber, an enclosure, anything can be used depending on
&gt; &gt; how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much room you have. The effect is like a mechanical sound filter. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; larger
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the siaze the lower tyhe effected frequencies. I use tubing so it can
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; made smaller to fit inside a cabinet. I don&#x27;t even measure anything
&gt; &gt; when
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make an echo chamber, it&#x27;s just made to fit whatever cabinet I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; using.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The boxes work without the chamber, but the chamber seems to add
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maybe a space where the sound can be more easily manipulated.
