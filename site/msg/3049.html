<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I can get that way too, but it&#x27;s going over the top. I don&#x27;t think 
there is a paranromal as such, it&#x27;s all normal. Banned button finger 
stands poised!

colleagues and peers the world over.  Ah,  well,  it&#x27;s not really 
important in the short-haul anyway.  Let me assure you Frank-S,  none 
of my intensions were to personally attack anyone!  I do attack ideas 
and statements that I strongly feel are blatantly wrong, mis-
construeing and apt to mis-lead if left to themselves, especially to 
the lay-person.  I am obviously opposed in my &quot;philosophy&quot; by several 
persons who,  in my opinion,  are prejudiced against those of us who 
are more open-minded concerning perceptions, analysis, experience, 
objectivity and etc. concerning the Paranormal.  This is,  of 
course,  S.O.P.  and expected.  Don&#x27;t be so sensitive,  open up and 
enjoy the contension.     --Rod

&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] for rod or eric or whatever your name is
&gt; 
&gt;       You have been a member of this group since 2004 and still 
have no 
&gt; idea what it&#x27;s about ? As far as me not watching ghost shows on tv, 
&gt; it seems by your explanation of how you have been involved in the 
PI 
&gt; field that you are a lot like those cheesy ghost hunting shows. To 
&gt; make a statement that spirits are not interactive and could care 
less 
&gt; about us or what we are trying to do, that alone shows you know 
&gt; nothing. I am a disabled rescue worker injured in the 911 attacks 
and 
&gt; am home all day with plenty of time for research and I can 
&gt; imphatically tell you that they do pay attention they do interact 
&gt; they are definitely interested and they are working harder than we 
&gt; are to communicate. 
&gt; 
&gt; maybe you have formed your opinion because in your vast wealth of 
&gt; knowledge and experience you have never come across a spirit that 
was 
&gt; interested in you. besides throwing you all around a room or 
lifting 
&gt; you into the air and hurling you like a shot put or whatever you 
&gt; claim some ghosts did. And if they did do that to you that sounds 
&gt; pretty interactive to me. I can see why they would want to throw 
you 
&gt; around and kick and bite you but if I where you I would find 
another 
&gt; hobby.
&gt; and I say hobby because by your analogy of it that&#x27;s all it is to 
you.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as your friend with the mini box, yeah I&#x27;m not stupid I 
&gt; figured that out, you can stop trying to defend it no one here is 
&gt; gonna buy that piece of crap.
&gt; 
&gt; I will not trade any more malicious posts with you so don&#x27;t bother.
