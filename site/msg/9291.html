 This might work and the price is right. I actau=
lly have two boards I want to make, the sweep board, and the AM tuner board=
. Then I might want to make a complete board, tuner and all. I was working =
on a board made to fit a RS project box, so the sides taper slightly. I had=
 to make two seprate boards, the sweep is on a smaller daughter board-both =
using perf board. 
 
 I hate it when that excitement starts setting in! It =
usually means days without sleep. 
 
 BTW, I don't think I would want 30 of=
 any given board, all at once anyway, but would want them available to othe=
rs--they can order their own(?) 
 
  The next problem is power, using the A=
A-8 packs is kind of poor, sometimes they melt down, and the life isn't lon=
g enough. 1.2ah gel cells are good, but pricy. $50 just for batteries. The =
boxes require a + and - supply, or two 12 volt batteries.
