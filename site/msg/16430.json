I&#39;m curious, because I know that if I try to record without plugging directly into the box, I don&#39;t hear much of anything -- it&#39;s only when I record the box directly (as well as a mic into which I ask my questions) that I hear all the numerous responses on playback. \n\nJill\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  27 seconds &quot;Frank we&#39;ll save you&quot;, 35 seconds &quot;this is progress&quot;, at 55\n&gt; seconds &quot;We prove Norma(wife)&quot;, and at the end, &quot;Record--Our Princess&quot;. I&#39;m\n&gt; using an Olympus WS-210S and I use a line adapter to plug directly into the\n&gt; board instead of recording open air.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
