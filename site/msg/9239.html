<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank,

I think you mentioned once before you were thinking about using PCBExpress 
to make boards.  I could probably make them a lot cheaper than they do. 
The only drawback I have is that if they are double-sided boards, I can&#x27;t 
do plated-through holes and have to use &quot;C&quot; wires for thru-board 
connections.

&gt; I hate to ask for anything. I can afford what I need for myself. What I want to do is make some printed circuit boards that have the sweep, and amplifiers, then I would only have to add whatever tuner I want to use to form a system, and I could make the boards available. I wouldn&#x27;t mind putting this stuff together for others, but the requests/demands are so overwhelming, there just isn&#x27;t enough time.
