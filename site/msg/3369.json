I cherish my\nFB and even though I must choose the location carefully with it it&#39;s\nthe messages that come through that make it profound. But the Shack\nHack is an important development, the timing of it is ironic\nconsidering other recent Box developments. \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot;\n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; HEY GUY&#39;S \n&gt; \n&gt; OF COURSE I HAVE MY RS HACK AND GETTING RESULTS THE FIRST DAY.\n&gt; MY INITIAL OPINION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS LITTLE GEM IS FROM TWO \n&gt; EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS ONE PERFORMED BY STEVE HULTAY AND MYSELF AND \n&gt; THE OTHER BY MYSELF ALONE. THE FILES I HAVE POSTED ARE GLEENED FROM \n&gt; ONLY THE FIRST MINUTE OR SO OF A TEN MINUTE RECORDING.PLEASE TAKE A \n&gt; MINUTE TO LISTEN AND POST YOUR FEEDBACK.\n&gt; \n&gt; THE FILES ARE POSTED IN THE FILE SECTION UNDER: \n&gt; \n&gt; 11-26-07_radio shack hack files_Bruce \n&gt; \n&gt; AFTER DOING ONLY ONE RECORDED SESSION AND TWO SESSIONS TOTAL. I AS A \n&gt; SERIOUS BOX RESEARCHER WITH EVRYDAY EXPERIMENTING ON FRANK&#39;S,JOE&#39;S \n&gt; AND NOW THE RADIO SHACK HACK BOX CAN PREMATURELY SAY THAT THIS RADIO \n&gt; MAY BE SMALL IN SIZE BUT IT PACKS A BIG PUNCH ! AND IT WAS UNDER OUR \n&gt; VERY NOSES ALL THE TIME. THANKS TO SUM DUC FOR HIS INSIGHT IN \n&gt; DISCOVERING IT.\n&gt; \n&gt; AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING REDUNDENT I MUST REITERATE THIS RS BOX WILL \n&gt; HOLD IT&#39;S OWN WITH THE BIG BOYS. THE RESULTS AND LEVEL OF \n&gt; COMMUNICATION BOTH IN REAL TIME DURING A SESSION AND WHAT IS MISSED \n&gt; BY OUR RUDIMENTARY HUMAN HEARING AND CAUGHT ON A RECORDING RIVALS OR \n&gt; MAY EVEN GIVEN ENOUGH TIME FOR FREQUENCY IMPRINTING BY OUR SPIRIT \n&gt; FRIENDS AND PROPER RESEARCH METHODS WILL SURPASS JOE&#39;S BOX AND PULL A \n&gt; CLOSE SECOND TO FRANK&#39;S BOX. \n&gt; \n&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE RS BOX WAS REMINICENT \n&gt; OF THE AM LINEAR MODE OF MY FRANKS BOX #12. LET&#39;S FACE IT A FRANKS \n&gt; BOX IS A FRANKS BOX IN AS NO TWO ARE EXACTLY THE SAME THAT IS WHAT \n&gt; MAKES THEM SO UNIQUE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT I BELIEVE A SMALL PART OF \n&gt; FRANK HIMSELF TRANSFERS INTO EVERY BOX HE MAKES AND HE IS VERY WELL \n&gt; RESPECTED ON THE OTHER SIDE FROM WHAT MY GUIDES AND TECHS TELL ME.\n&gt; \n&gt; I HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE RON RICKETS MINI BOX YET BUT I \n&gt; AM HEARING VERY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT&#39;S PERFORMANCE ALSO AND CAN NOT \n&gt; WAIT TO EXPERIMENT WITH IT.\n&gt; \n&gt; I THINK OUR FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE FINALY DECIDING TO PUSH \n&gt; FORWARD WITH THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS AND ALLOW IT TO BECOME \n&gt; ACCESABLE TO MANY MORE PEOPLE. WHAT THEY HAVE CONVEYED TO ME OVER \n&gt; NUMEROUS SESSIONS IS THE DESPERATE AND INTRIGAL NEED FOR COMBINED \n&gt; HARMONY AMONG RESEARCHERS AND COMMUNICATORS. THE MORE MINDS THAT ARE \n&gt; THINKING AND MOVING TOGETHER FOR THIS COMMON GOAL THE STRONGER THE \n&gt; SPIRITS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE AND THEY WILL HELP WITH DEVELOPE MENT \n&gt; OF THE TECHNOLOGY SO THINGS ARE LOOKING UP AND HEADING TO THE FUTURE. \n&gt; \n&gt; WHAT I HAVE GATHERED OVER MANY SESSIONS IS THEY DEFINATELY WANT THE \n&gt; WORD AND THE TECHNOLOGY SPREAD TO AS MANY AS ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT IT \n&gt; WITH AN OPEN MIND. I AM RATTLING ON AND HAVE DRIFTED FROM MY ORIGINAL \n&gt; POINT WHICH WAS, THIS RADIO SHACK BOX IS AND WILL BE A VERY IMPORTANT \n&gt; AND USEFULL TOOL IN FURTHERING OUR COMMUNICATION PROCESS.\n&gt; \n&gt; THANKS FOR LISTENING.\n&gt; \n&gt; BRUCE\n&gt;"}
