<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanx, i have great contacts and communication.  I get very similar 
results with every box i have tested so far, i just like to put my 
files up for everyone to hear.  Sharing the files is the key to great 
research, i can tell people i get great communication but i&#x27;d rather 
show them.  It adds validity to my claims.

&gt; Just look at the date to see the 2 files from today. I was 
verifying 
&gt; communication for others to hear. So i used Babs as an example of 
an 
&gt; uncommon name as well as mine and bruce&#x27;s name. The first file 
&gt; probably got lost on this board at this point with all the audio 
&gt; uploads recently....JULI !!!!! Just kidding, but listen to the 2 
new 
&gt; files from today in the folder and let me know what you guys think. 
I 
&gt; already know i have good communication with my two friends on the 
other 
&gt; side named Mike and Lisa, but i want to show others that what i get 
is 
&gt; real. If anybody wants to do a test session through Skype just e-
mail 
&gt; me and we can set something up.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx,
&gt; -Steve H.
