&gt; &gt; This is Frank&#x27;s group and I am here to learn how to make the boxes and

&gt; don&#x27;t believe in what we are
&gt; &gt; doing or trying to do.... If you don&#x27;t have a box to work with or listen
&gt; to, how can you be skeptical about
&gt; &gt; what someone hears regardless of whether they write out what they hear or
&gt; not? Alot of times we don&#x27;t hear
&gt; &gt; the same things ,so it is ridiculous for people to believe it&#x27;s the power
&gt; of suggestion.
&gt; &gt; RJ&#x27;s experiments are to disprove for his own personal reasons, not to
&gt; help this group in any way.
&gt; &gt; So, why don&#x27;t you skeptical people and the ones who want to try different
&gt; methods and any other personal
&gt; &gt; ideas that you have, start your own group? This is Frank&#x27;s group......
&gt; &gt; I personally want to see what Frank and Steve come up with and that&#x27;s why
&gt; MOST of us are here....
&gt; &gt; not to criticize them..or try to do experiments disproving anything....

&gt; &gt; if frank will end that project here, then you (or we all) have the
&gt; possibility to open another yahoo group and we can continue
&gt; &gt; to discussing. in a group all members must have the opportunity to write
&gt; his ideas and, if someone like RJ (or some others,
&gt; &gt; maybe like me) tend to other types of ideas and try to point to other
&gt; prespectives, what is here wrong?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; we must be prepared to all evidences, also evidences that are not
&gt; convenient to our personal ideas but
&gt; &gt; maybe we can learn something more and we can change our point of view.
&gt; think about that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; i try to reach the goal of the &quot;voices&quot; with a sceptict mind, but i am
&gt; experimenting with many differente methods to hopefully
&gt; &gt; reach maybe one day something more convincing.

&gt; &gt; RJ, it is very obvious that you are not here for the same reasons we are.
&gt; We are trying to prove something we know, and
&gt; &gt; you are trying to disprove it .
&gt; &gt; Why don&#x27;t we all just ignore him from now on and not reply to anything he

&gt; &gt; I realize you have plenty of subjective anecdotal evidence.I don&#x27;t
&gt; consider that &#x27;hard evidence&#x27; however. I am looking for something a little
&gt; more objective and less subject to influence and interpretations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And stop putting words in my mouth. A person can misinterpret something,
&gt; mistake something, or confuse something, without lying about something. And
&gt; before you jump down my throat claiming I am saying all results are
&gt; mistakes, I am not. I am performing experiments, keeping an open mind, and
&gt; considering all evidence I find.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The way you have been attacking me by calling me names at every turn,
&gt; just because I try new things and don&#x27;t always agree with your world view,
&gt; is eerily reminiscent of the way the church of old tried to suppress new
&gt; thought and discoveries, except you&#x27;re just substituting the word &#x27;heretic&#x27;
&gt; with &#x27;science&#x27;. and &#x27;blasphemy&#x27; with anything that disagrees with you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There&#x27;s an old saying: &quot;We become that which we hate&quot;. So far, all you&#x27;ve
&gt; done is denounce people&#x27;s efforts to try new methods and see what works. You
&gt; accept nothing anyone else proposes if it does not agree with you. That is
&gt; the realm of the extreme skeptic: the same skeptic you ridicule.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You certainly don&#x27;t have to agree with my comments. And I don&#x27;t have to
&gt; agree with yours. But no one needs all the name calling Frank. It really
&gt; adds nothing to support your theories.

&gt; &gt; Yeah I know, science no accept anecdotes. There is plenty of hard
&gt; evidence, trouble, science don&#x27;t accept that either cuz they are taught, no
&gt; spirits, so there are no sprit voices, fact is fact is facts. Well that&#x27;s
&gt; about all there is in this field. Perhaps you should take bird watching or
&gt; something concrete. To not accept what others say is the same as calling us
&gt; all liars, and I find very insulting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How irrational is it to ignore all evidence and continuously try to fit
&gt; the phenomon into a diffintion where it will not fit and does not belong,
&gt; and then claim you&#x27;re looking for a more rational explantation, it just does
&gt; not make sense. I say forget the BS &quot;science&quot; whatever that is, puts out and

&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t think I have enough data yet to make any conclusions, so I plan
&gt; more experiments. Since there are different distinct claims about what the
&gt; box or the recorders can do, I try to make different distinct experiments
&gt; for each.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Some people claim they can get the box to tell them things that the
&gt; operator couldn&#x27;t know, so my &quot;whats the object&quot; experiment is one way to
&gt; examine that. Some people claim the boxes can make predictions, so
&gt; cataloging predictions and examining the results can help examine that. If
&gt; there are other claims, I will try to figure experiments based on those.

&gt; &gt; I get our last dogs from time to time, and used to get them via white

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yeah, I think I was too hard on RJ. I don&#x27;t know why, but testing doens&#x27;t
&gt; seem to work, but we get enough to prove this to ourselves. It&#x27;s probably a

&gt; &gt; Here is a short file, where someone says, &quot;Scamp, Scamp,&quot; then Scamp
&gt; barks. &quot;yap.&quot; This little dog belonged to my grandma, when I was about 9 or
&gt; 10 years old, he was a Manchester Terrier, and lived with us for many years,
&gt; and this is his bark for sure. I&#x27;d know that bark anywhere. Sorry, that I
&gt; can&#x27;t make it any clearer, I need to get one of those better ghost boxes I
&gt; guess. RJ, spirits are just like us, they are not omnipresent like God,
&gt; probably why David doesn&#x27;t want to play the guessing game, he has better
&gt; things to do over there, and has said, they have thousands of people
&gt; standing in this long line waiting to get into the Heavens, and He can&#x27;t
&gt; just drop His job and go to your house to see what you have over there, He
&gt; did tell me that first time what it was, and i sent it to you, but it was
&gt; too late. It&#x27;s hard for me to understand them sometimes, He was also right
&gt; about that little boy, Syler being killed, and where his body would be
