I am getting an error message when I start the record button on the 
Audacity program.

 It says Error while opening sound device. Please check the imput 
device setting and the project sample rate.

Any advice?

Kay

&gt; Hi Kay.  Just use the patch cord I described in my previous 
response ... connect it from the 
&gt; headphone jack on the recorder to the mic jack on your computer.  
Open Audacity (or 
&gt; whatever), hit the record button, then hit the play button on the 
recorder to play the 
&gt; session into the computer.  
&gt; 
&gt; When you&#x27;re done, press the stop button on the recording software, 
the stop button on 
&gt; the recorder itself, and then save your session.  From there, you 
can begin to work with it, 
&gt; without worry of losing any data.  Just be sure when you close the 
file DON&#x27;T SAVE 
&gt; CHANGES on the original, so you always have the raw version to 
refer back to.
&gt; 
&gt; You can do this same thing with any recorder that has an earphone 
jack.  Just go with the 
&gt; one you are drawn to.  There are a bunch of them on eBay.  If you 
are doing sweep, you 
&gt; don&#x27;t even need a digital recorder, just plug in a mic into your 
computer and record on it.  
&gt; This saves you all the time and hassle of moving the file from the 
recorder into your 
&gt; computer.  That&#x27;s what I do.  You really only need a digital 
recorder for traditional work or 
&gt; portability (unless you have a laptop, which is pretty easy to take 
with you.)  :-)

&gt; &gt; Can anyone tell what would be the best way to transfer a session 
I 
&gt; &gt; recorded on an older microcassette recorder to my computer? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I did my first recorded session last night. All went great except 
for 
&gt; &gt; the lousy reception. I didn&#x27;t realize just how much you miss 
during a 
&gt; &gt; real time session when you play back what you recorded. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I got two different Steve&#x27;s one sounded Australian and a Mike. I 
also 
&gt; &gt; got the number &quot;Seven&quot; I am sure there is lots more there but my 
&gt; &gt; reception was so bad I can&#x27;t hear everything.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also what would be a good digital recorder (relatively cheap) to 
get 
&gt; &gt; that you can easily transfer to your computer?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any help would be appreciated.
