<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah--it&#x27;s the the minibox. Everything I posted so far tonight was in  
the first 1 minute of turning it on. I haven&#x27;t even gotten midway  
through listening to it and realized this is another one of those  
sessions where things were bang on and I could post dozens of files.  
Wow.

Bruce, I think you&#x27;ll be pleased to know that I lit my Buddhist altar  
and did a protection prayer first. :)

And I put a quartz crystal on top of the box to boot.

Hedging all my bets today!
