&gt; Time is absolutely being removed from the audio files. There is so
&gt; much more than just listening to the files, you have too look. You
&gt; have to train your eyes as well as your ears to make any sort of
&gt; judgment. The second I load some of these files, before I listen, I
&gt; see problems. I know the site isn&#x27;t set up to really leave comments 
on
&gt; files with the file but something should be included in the name or
&gt; something. Without it, it is not true representation of what the 
file
&gt; is or what has happened between the capture and the post. We listen
&gt; and think &quot;Wow! Great catch&quot; but we really do not know. 
&gt; 
&gt; Are you starting the scan on your 3 469&#x27;s at different frequencies?
&gt; What is the ratio being mixed? Is it equal between the three? 
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that Mark and Debbie Constantino (sp)of Nevada use water
&gt; almost exclusively for their recordings. I have found that method to
&gt; be difficult in hearing the results. Are you feeling that those
&gt; communications are from spirits or earthbounds and what makes you 
feel
&gt; that way?
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ve recently started analyzing a 40 min 469 session. The results 
are
&gt; scary. I&#x27;d say at this point, and I&#x27;m only 1/2 way through, 90% of 
the
&gt; communication is negative in nature and mentions many supposed 
Demonic
&gt; names. The layers of voices are, in many cases, multiple. Often, the
&gt; listener hears very little of what is actually said. The voices can 
be
&gt; mocking or downright crude. I have not yet formed an opinion fully 
but
&gt; it would seem to me that these models are easy devices for lower 
level
&gt; entities to figure out how to use. I can not speak of the attitudes 
or
&gt; fears of those investigators present although at times, their voices
&gt; are a bit shaky.

&gt; &gt; Very good observation Babs. Let me say that you have many friends
&gt; and associates here just for the simple fact that you have an 
interest
&gt; in ITC, are a researcher and a complex thinker. I think we have 
shown
&gt; in the past that we can have a disagreement and still remain 
friends.
&gt; You make a lot of good points in your post and I would like to know
&gt; who removes time from their recordings. I have never removed time 
from
&gt; my recordings and see no reason why anyone else would without saying
&gt; so in an accompanied post.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have limited experience with the 12-469&#x27;s as a single piece of
&gt; equipment. I have arranged mine per Mike&#x27;s, &quot;Spiricomp&quot; design. I 
have
&gt; 3, 12-469&#x27;s feeding a four channel mixer, which goes into a laptop
&gt; running DC6 with Soundsoap 2. Mine scan equally spaced on the FM 
band.
&gt; I have had pretty good results until recently.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; At first the messages were pretty clear but I had a feeling I was
&gt; getting a different group than I normally have for the last few 
years.
&gt; When I would ask about my friends on the other side they would tell 
me
&gt; they will look for them. Well about 2 weeks ago the 12-469 
arrangement
&gt; started generating a lot of interference and feedback. I started
&gt; hearing radio static voices as I use to get with shortwave. Not 
voice
&gt; fragments but voices made of static (metallic and robotic). They 
were
&gt; breaking through the sweeping. I had a feeling someone else was 
trying
&gt; to force their way through. Finally the interference got so bad I 
was
&gt; forced to revert back to a simpler method I used before, which is
&gt; using fan noise. One of the first messages to come across was from a
&gt; familiar voice telling me and I quote, &quot;your method sucks&quot;. I have 
not
&gt; used the 12-469&#x27;s since because of the clear messages I have been
&gt; getting using water and fan noise. That does not mean I have given 
up
&gt; &gt;  on the 12-469&#x27;s but I won&#x27;t use them again until I am persuaded 
to
&gt; by my friends on the otherside that they are willing to use and 
adapt
&gt; to it. To my knowledge only Misty, Laura and myself use water for
&gt; recording.

&gt; &gt;     
&gt; &gt;             Alright, you all know I&#x27;m vocal and I haven&#x27;t made any
&gt; &quot;friends&quot; here
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; but, if we can put that aside for a moment...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Spirit communication has been my passion since day one, a little 
over
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 6 years ago. I am a believer in the afterlife and a believer in
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; spirits attempting to communicate with us for a variety of 
reasons. I
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; have spiritual beliefs that I feel strongly about and devote much 
of
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; my waking (and sleeping) moments to thoughts about this field.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; However, I am also a researcher and a skeptic. In order for me to
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; allow ideas to become part of my reality I must experiment. In 
order
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; for me to believe something is paranormal I HAVE to rule out all 
other
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; possible causes. That being said, I have some questions. My hope 
is
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; that there are some here willing to enter into discussion with me.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a difficult time with many of the files here. Many times, 
there
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; is no question included in the file. I can not determine whether 
or
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; not the &quot;reply&quot; is an intelligent reply. Maybe this has to do with
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; allowable file size.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Some of the files I have been able to download. (I don&#x27;t always 
keep
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; my email settings on for this group as I get too many - lol) When 
I
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; look at the file I see problems. There will be complete flat line
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; silence between the words. Many times the &quot;reply&quot; is also at the 
same
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; decibel as the question askers voice. Those two things should not
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; occur naturally considering the devices being used. That tells me 
that
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; there is manipulation of the files. Now, what is manipulation to 
me,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; may not be manipulation to others. To me, any altering of the 
recorded
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; file constitutes manipulation. I do not know if the reply was
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; intelligent or manipulated to be intelligent. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Some say that they simply remove the &quot;no response&quot; time. I&#x27;ve been
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; told it can be as much as 18 seconds removed from between words. 
Now
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; we run into the problem of us deciding what word fits in with the
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; question. What words are being ignored?  Did we take nonsense and 
make
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; sense? Did we amp every noise/word or only what fit?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think it&#x27;s great that files are offered for peer review. 
However, I
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; think we have to load them untouched or at the very least, offer
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; exactly what was done to the entire file. Time elapsed between 
words,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; what was amped, etc. I&#x27;d also love to see some of these sessions 
video
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; taped with the question asker facing the camera and a second hand
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; clock visible. Truly, we aren&#x27;t researching if we don&#x27;t have some
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; protocol in place.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here is an issue I have with the RS Hacks. I have the 469. It 
takes
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; approximately 18 seconds to scan through the AM frequencies. Now, 
the
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; typical person would think that we can take that 18 seconds and 
divide
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; it by the number of AM stations to determine how long we are on 
each
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; station before moving on to the next one. In that way we could
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; determine what is impossible to be said via a radio fragment. 
However,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; that&#x27;s not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one frequency to 
the
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; next and of course the biggest problem is that some stations are
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; picked up over multiple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard on 630, 
640,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 650, 660 and maybe even 670. That extends the time a great deal. 
This
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; is a difficult problem because it is almost impossible for the 
average
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; person to be able to make a determination on time this way. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I heard about the following today; An experimenter records at the 
same
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; time every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importance of 
meditating,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but what we 
have to
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; remember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning into the 
same
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; radio show every day. One of my first experiments with the 469 
had me
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; hearing this deep male voice over and over again. What was he 
trying
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; to tell me, I wondered. Than I realized that he was speaking
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; approximately every 18 seconds; every time the scan hit that 
station.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, if you are removing up to 18 seconds between words, then you 
are
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; really only recording the words from one station. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides discussion
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; about some research problems. I know that there are those who are 
not
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; concerned with anything more than the communication itself but I 
think
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; that it is of the utmost importance to attempt to factor in some
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; protocol in order for this to be considered serious research at 
all.
