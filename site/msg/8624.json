I gave the group the \ntape, so I won&#39;t be able able to play those.

I loaned a box to another group, and they also got entities to \nanswer questions, and interact. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  RoboBox did perform for a group, with at least one meaningful comment. A woman \ncame to the table afte the talk, and asked &quot; Do they onokly talk for you&quot;&quot;, and immediately \nRoboBox put out &quot;for you&quot;, followed after a few seconds &quot;Loves to cook&quot;, the woman was a \ncook!\n&gt;  \n&gt;  The whole thing is very energy intense. \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; In a rush?
