<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>After viewing Mike&#x27;s RS 12-469 hack video for the fifth time I felt 
ready to take the plunge myself, so yesterday while dh was picking up 
a pizza at Papa John&#x27;s I sneaked next door and bought the radio. He 
couldn&#x27;t stop complaining about how I&#x27;d wasted money on a perfectly 
good piece of equipment only to wreck it for my dumb hobby, but once 
we got home he took it upon himself to test it and make sure it 
worked.  For some reason it really DIDN&#x27;T work, so he took it back to 
RS and exchanged it for another one, and after making sure THAT one 
worked he even offered to help me with the modification.  &quot;No thanks&quot; 
I told him.  &quot;I think I need to do this myself.&quot;  

I can&#x27;t pretend the process went as smoothly as I&#x27;d hoped, but 
finally I was done and making the last turn in the second screw of 
the circuit board.. and then.. The whole thing flew out of my hands 
and both battery wires ripped away from their soldered ends in the 
casing.  It was all Bob could do to keep from gleefully yelling &quot;I 
knew you were going to break it!&quot;  But then I guess he felt bad 
because he ran down to Walmart and got a soldering iron and solder 
and spent an hour trying to put it all back together for me.  

It&#x27;s dead as a doornail, and I&#x27;m thinking that if I could break it 
that easily without even knowing how or why, maybe I&#x27;m not supposed 
to pursue this method (sigh).  I guess I&#x27;ll just think it over and 
maybe try again later.  

Thanks for all the helpful information though Mike!
