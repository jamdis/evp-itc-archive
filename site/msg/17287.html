I don't see debunkers here:=C2=A0 I see people trying to investigate EVP-I=
TC as a science, rather than as a religion.

And to those I would say: don'=
t give up.=C2=A0 You get a lot of insults and flack here when you question =
the religion of EVP: when you ask for good process, or repeatability, or ob=
jective testing.=C2=A0 And when you question claims that provide no substan=
tiation, or testing, or objective process.

I think this group could use mu=
ch more science, so I encourage you to participate more, and invite the mor=
e science-oriented.=C2=A0=C2=A0 It's in the marketplace of ideas, the diver=
sity of opinion,=C2=A0 the exchange of knowledge, and the crucible of the s=
cientific method, that we make the best progress.

So all you scientists, s=
tay, and bring more!=C2=A0 And all the non-scientists, I'd encourage, if yo=
u don't already, googling the Scientific Method, and giving it a shot.

oo, do you just hang out on these groups to bebunk, or do you have an actua=
l interest in EVP?</div>
<div> </div>
<div> You can explain anyth=
ing away if you need that, but most of us are smart enough to know when we =
are fooling ourselves and when there is something real going on.  =

<div> </div>
<div> Who needs this constant --this is what=
 you're really hearing-- BS explanations?  </div>
<div> </div>
<d=
iv> EVP is far more complicated than just cut and dried sounds, there&=
nbsp;is psychic component, where you're using the sound as a psychic prop f=
or your own senses. There's the messages tuned to a specific individual, so=
 no one is going ot hear it the same if at all. Everyone is wired different=
, and just because no two poeple hear an EVP the same does not invalidate i=
t. </div>

<div> </div>
<div> Maybe you should go debunk music, n=
o one hears songs the same either. </div>
