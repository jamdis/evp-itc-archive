<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>To me, the one sounds like &quot;f***ed up&quot; rather than &quot;put up,&quot; but I  
hear the rest pretty much as you do, Misty. The autolaugh one is

&gt; I just uploaded a 45 sec sample of a session with evp maker.  I

&gt; evpmaker.  I am including 45 seconds of a 2:45 min session so that  
&gt; anyone in the group might comment on the quality of the recording.   
&gt; I have been getting zero results...that I can hear...maybe I am  
&gt; doing something wrong technically.  Maybe I am not hearing right.
