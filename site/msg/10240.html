I hate to say it but out of all the responses I have heard Mike 
Edwards seem to get the best reponses to his questions on his 
clickity 12-469 shack hack box. I think advancement isnt just about 
the equipment you use but the relationship you develop with the 
spirits.

&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to make a serious suggestion.
&gt; As a senior researcher in the live spirit communication field, 
Myself 
&gt; and a few other researchers here such as Steve hultay, Ann, LC
&gt; Just to mention a couple have strived since the beginning to try 
and 
&gt; advance the technology, communication and relations with our 
spirit 
&gt; friends or whatever entities are participating in this 
communication 
&gt; research.
&gt; 
&gt; In order to call this research it must continue to move forward.
&gt; There are more than enough of the new people here, that do not 
&gt; qualify as new people anymore. But full fledged researchers. Of 
&gt; course they have much to learn, but so do we all.
&gt; 
&gt; Which brings me to my suggestion.
&gt; Steve and I have recently been discussing the point we have 
reached 
&gt; in the research, both in process and knowledge. We agreed on most 
&gt; points,
&gt; the most important one being. It is time to move beyond the same 
&gt; mundane session content and the same rudimentary line of 
questioning.
&gt; 
&gt; This research is stagnating for lack of direction, any posted 
files 
&gt; or discussions revolve around the same stale subjects such as, 
&gt; &quot;Is there anyone there that wishes to communicate&quot;, 
&gt; &quot;What is your name&quot;
&gt; &quot;who am I speaking with&quot;
&gt; &quot;what is it like where you are&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I believe we have all received every combination of answer to 
those 
&gt; questions that we possibly can, yet we continue to ask them 
session 
&gt; after session. And still become amazed at a yes or no answer or 
the 
&gt; simplest of phrases.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not saying this about any single level of researcher but all 
of 
&gt; us myself included have fallen into this rut. We are not learning 
&gt; anything, All our efforts are amounting to nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; We already know that we are communicating with someone or 
something. 
&gt; I believe we have all come to believe that through our personal 
&gt; research and the evidence presented by all of us.
&gt; 
&gt; Within the last year the technology and potential of this type of 
&gt; research has exceeded all expectations in it&#x27;s quality and speed 
of 
&gt; development. We are actually letting it go to waste.
&gt; 
&gt; I and a few other researchers believe that whoever is on the other 
&gt; side of the line has had a hand in some of us developing this new 
&gt; equipment and methods of research be it obvious or subtle.
&gt; 
&gt; But our methods of research have not excelled, we are conducting 
&gt; research in the same manner as we did when there where only about 
5 
&gt; of us in the whole world actively doing this research.
&gt; 
&gt; New individuals are joining our ranks and becoming interested in 
box 
&gt; research every day. The protocol they are being instructed to use 
is 
&gt; antiquated and obsolete.
&gt; 
&gt; It is fine to teach them these methods as a basic foundation of 
the 
&gt; research and to get their feet wet. But like any other education 
&gt; process it must evolve and develop with the accumulation of 
knowledge.
&gt; 
&gt; If we approached academic education the way we approach box 
research, 
&gt; we would all still be in the first grade.
&gt; 
&gt; I propose a committee to develop a method of research and protocol 
&gt; that can deal with the ever evolving technology and decide what 
and 
&gt; how we should approach the type of communication we seek and the 
&gt; subject matter that should be addressed, that will be continually 
&gt; changing.
&gt; 
&gt; Only in this way will the wheels of research and learning move 
&gt; forward and we will gain the knowledge we seek and hopefully be 
able 
&gt; to share it with the world someday.
&gt; 
&gt; But if we continue to ask &quot;Is anyone there willing to speak with 
me&quot;
&gt; We are doomed.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone that wishes to discuss this and give opinions or suggestions
&gt; please lets try and get started every minute we waste is a missed 
&gt; opportunity for learning.
