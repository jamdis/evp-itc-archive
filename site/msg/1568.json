My gf Crystal strikes again. She has a big \n&gt;mouth LOL. I was only &quot;looking&quot; at coming out that way for a visit I didnt \n&gt;make any plans yet. I looked at many places of interest near friends is she \n&gt;gonna go tell all of them too? LOL and yeah Ive been getting alot of \n&gt;overtime in lately. What a blabbermouth hehehe\n&gt;\n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           These are from using a larger echo box wiht #13, not the one I \n&gt;was making\n&gt;tonight, this box is made out of wood, I made it last year. The voices are\n&gt;copied off the tape as I back up(rewind) the tape, and kind of &quot;feel&quot; where\n&gt;to stop and copy segments to the computer. A &quot;trick&quot; I find more useful \n&gt;that\n&gt;going form front to back.\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________________\n&gt;http://newlivehotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;Moody friends.
