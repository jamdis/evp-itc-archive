Bruce,
   
  Happy New Year to you too! Thanks for tryin but sometimes its just not for everyone ears. Never know who hears what til ya post it =) I dont worry about quality so much anymore because whats crystal clear for some sounds like blahbedeblah to others.

          Misty,
 
Happy new year, I listened to the files a few times and unless you read 
what they are labeled I could not hear anything but misty in the second one
I don't think it was quality just volume of the voice itself.

Personally I'm always disappointed at my stuff being out there, and 
the incredible lack of clarity obatained with it, to me that's a huge 
failure! I know the stuff works, but how to get it to a level that can 
be understood by most, that's the problem, and my focus at the moment. 
The Mini Box is big step in that direction, so some of the pressure if 
off, but I still need to get my boxes to professional level.
