The effect is like a mechanical sound filter. The larger\n&gt; the siaze the lower tyhe effected frequencies.  I use tubing so it can be\n&gt; made smaller to fit inside a cabinet.  I don&#39;t even measure anything when I\n&gt; make an echo chamber, it&#39;s just made to fit whatever cabinet I&#39;m using.\n&gt; \n&gt;  The boxes work without the chamber, but the chamber seems to add something,\n&gt; maybe a space where the sound can be more easily manipulated.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Aug 20, 2010 at 1:40 PM, Luis &lt;luispucp098@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I need to know about the echo chamber ... dimensions, materials , anyone\n&gt; &gt; knows it?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
