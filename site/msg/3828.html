&gt;  Hi All, What&#x27;s to keep Chris from getting a Patent of his own on  
&gt; HIS &quot;Telephone to The Dead&quot;? Does Frank have his &quot;Franks Box&quot;  
&gt; Patented by the U.S. Patent Offices (the cost is low for this,  
&gt; BTW)???? I think it has merit thus far, for Frank to consider a  
&gt; Lawsuit! So what if it was a gift, Frank stated it was to be used  
&gt; in 1 place (statonary) &amp; for testing purposes ONLY. What Chris has  
&gt; done with it, is Run with it making several businesses with it and  
&gt; making a profit from it . . . . this is NOT what Frank intended HIS  
&gt; Box(es) to be used as! =Judy=
&gt;

There is nothing to stop Frank from trying to patent it, if he so  
chooses. But it&#x27;s his choice.

Neither I, nor you, know the details that passed between Chris and  
Frank. Only they could testify to it. It would be a case of he/he  
said. And what good would it serve anyone? We&#x27;re back to the bull  
crap of the Edison v. Tesla Gangs.

This line of conversation needs to ends, HMO.
