Everything I&#39;m getting is coming  \n&gt; through very fast and seems to come through at the faster sweep  \n&gt; rate. I have to slow everything by about half to hear it clearly on  \n&gt; playback. Are they pushing stuff through at the higher sweep  \n&gt; because it&#39;s more efficient for them to do it that way? Maybe they  \n&gt; have to slow things down to get to anything to us to begin with. It  \n&gt; makes sense if they are in a higher vibration than we are. Maybe  \n&gt; the faster sweep is more sympathetic to them, albeit harder on us,  \n&gt; for two-way communication.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think I made any real sense, but there you go...\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt; oy oy oy what a day\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Jan 24, 2008, at 10:43 AM, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC\n&gt; group.\n&gt;\n&gt; File : /*Bruce FB#12 files/36_speed up or slow sweep_THIS WILL SAVE  \n&gt; US TIME.wav\n&gt; Uploaded by : bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;\n&gt; Description : 36_speed up or slow sweep_THIS WILL SAVE US TIME.wav\n&gt;\n&gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/%2ABruce%20FB%2312% \n&gt; 20files/36_speed%20up%20or%20slow%20sweep_THIS%20WILL%20SAVE%20US% \n&gt; 20TIME.wav\n&gt;\n&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/ \n&gt; index.htmlfiles\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Shed those extra pounds with MSN and The Biggest Loser!
