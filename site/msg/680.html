 not the center of anyone's attention!  Sounds like more all nighters to me!! 
 I stayed up almost all night Monday so I could build yet another board, 
 while I'm working I have these other ideas floating around in my head, 
 waiting for a place to land. Like revisiting Spircom, and trying to apply 
 what I know to it, thanks to Ryan! I think if I were to make a square wave 
 audio generator, since a square wave contains all hamonics, randomly tune it 
 to get that random function, then use that to modulate a simple transmtter, 
 then receive that signal on a simple reciever a short distance away, maybe I 
 can do something like Meek did. The transmitter/receiver can be made with 
 mixer chips, like the SA602, and I have some in my junk box (a techy's parts 
 bins). Then the audio circuits are again just op amps, and I just got an 
 order in.
 
 I've often wondered about the possiblity of modulating a White Noise 
 signal, then listening for a response on a White Noise based receiver, using 
 White Noise instead of a local oscillator, yeah, using normal voice to 
 modulate the noise. You could use crystal filters to narrow the transmission 
 to a small RF spectrum, something easy, like around 10mhz, but I'm not sure 
 if ultra sound might not be better, since there's  some that claim that's 
 where the spirits hang out. We need an Edison set up, a room full of 
 researchers testing ideas.
