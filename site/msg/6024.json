One of you were very surprised to discover that time is being\nremoved from posted files. One of you freaked out when I suggested\nthat raw files should be whats posted. One offered to post both. One\nsaid no way! One of you has files incredibly clearer than anyone else.\nOne of you is beginning to look a little less on the up and up. Two\nhave emailed me their own concerns for the integrity in research. Call\nme what you will but, if integrity is what has you riled up, if a\ndesire for raw true files to be posted causes an issue then so be it.\nMaybe your smelling the shit I stirred and maybe thats because you\njust might be standing in it. \n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday\n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Don&#39;t apologise and don&#39;t be sucked in!\n&gt; she&#39;s a spy and a crap stirrer, the less she is here the better.\n&gt;  \n&gt; She has no concern for the research or how it is conducted.

For\nexample, &quot;Hey, Ann--that file you just posted, I hear what you do, but\nis anything clipped out of it? I think I hear a track silenced, too.\nIf so, why did you do that?&quot; Then I get to answer and explain why I\ndid it that way, offer the raw clip, or whatever. It doesn&#39;t come off\nas a broad attack--just a friendly question. Even Bruce wouldn&#39;t rip\nout your living eyeballs for that. (Well... maybe he wouldn&#39;t, anyway.\n;) ) \n&gt; \n&gt; I agree with your search for The Truth. I really do. That&#39;s why you\nsee me get all rough-and-tumble over stuff like the Luminator when I\nthink it is it lacking convincing evidence. But it&#39;s waaaaaay too\nearly in &quot;boxology&quot; to try to make it perform as a pet circus animal.\nHell, we&#39;ve been studying traditional EVP for 30 years and it still\nwon&#39;t perform on cue for the scientists or anyone else. But if you\njust listen to what you get on your own and what all the others are\ngetting, it becomes very clear indeed that a real phenomenon is\noccurring. Sure, some things we get that we think are paranormal may\nbe just radio fragments, but one radio fragment does not negate all\nbox communication. One tweaked clip is not indicative of a culture of\nresearcher deceit. One &quot;I am Bazoozoo! Time to fry, foolish mortal!&quot;\ndoes not mean that the RS hacks are pathways to Satan&#39;s indoor\nplumbing. There are no easy answers yet--and there may never be any.\nAnd I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re at the stage yet where we have the right to\ndemand The Truth or whether we would even see it if it was staring us\nin the face.\n&gt; \n&gt; All right, enough joy in myself one-hand clapping.\n&gt; \n&gt; LC is right that if you want to try to pursue this in the way you\nwant to pursue it, then you need to find some people who share your\nmindset and go to it. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to find those people\nhere, necessarily--at least among the old guard. We&#39;re the beatniks in\nblack leather, smoking ciggies and reading bad poetry to the beat of\nbongos, HMO.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Jan 21, 2008, at 1:37 PM, babiarz3 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Just to clear things up.. the file I&#39;m referring to is not from\nanyoneinvolved in this group so when I say that occasionally I hear\ntheirvoices become shaky, that is not a comment on anyone here.\nAlso,please don&#39;t misread what I actually said. The point I made, or\ntriedto make, about the investigators not hearing what I heard...\nIwouldn&#39;t have heard all of it in real time either. Too many\nlayers,too fast, etc. I have the luxury now of sitting and analyzing\nthe filein my own time. As for fear being a factor... I do believe\nthat the attitude of theinvestigators present during a session does\neffect the outcome. EvenBruce who would rather cut my eyeballs out\nwith a razor has said thesame. If you think that I am scared, fine. If\nI&#39;m missing one thing itis probably a healthy dose of fear. Don&#39;t make\nthe mistake of missingthe points by name calling. I post my thoughts\nhere because it is an active group of peopleworking with this form of\nITC. You can call me a shit stirrer orwhatever you want. The point is\nthat I see issues that could beaddressed fairly easily. You can ignore\nit or deflect all you want.For me, it&#39;s not about being friends, it&#39;s\nabout the research. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Ratka\n&lt;warrior18eii@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Good answer!
