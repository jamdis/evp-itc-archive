After hearing that, if I didn&#39;t already have a box \nor two or three... I&#39;d be making one for sure!\nMy only shortwave option is using my old Reaistic DX-160 and tuning the \nknob back and forth real fast.  When it comes to shortwave listening, I \njust love the older analog rigs.  I&#39;ve had my share of digital units, \nbut always go back to an old analog rig. The only two I now have are \nthe DX-160 and a Sangean SG-796 tiny portable.\nI&#39;m listening to a group of breakfast club guys on 80 meter ssb right \nnow.\nEnjoy your weekend...\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@...m, &quot;billliscomb&quot; &lt;williscomb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Two new files in &quot;12 21 07&quot; folder.  Played with the R75 shortwave a \n&gt; bit tonight.  The R75 may not scan fast enough - I&#39;ll play with \n&gt; adjusting the filters next.  I recorded a bit of it scanning and ran \n&gt; that thru EVPmaker and got some clips - not great but it worked, so \n&gt; went back to the doctor giving a talk raw audio on EVPmaker and got \n&gt; these two.  Guess I&#39;ll make a box....\n&gt; Willy\n&gt;"}
