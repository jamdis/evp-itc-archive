[4 Attachments]\n\n\n  [Attac=\r\nhment(s) from Frank Sumption included below] \n\n\n\n   This is from the old RS=\r\n digital that I did last night. Mostly they seemed to be talk about Chris M=\r\noon, and the box with the lever switches, which is #46. For those that may =\r\nhave heard otherwise, experimenting with tones was my idea, there was no &quot;s=\r\npecifications&quot; for the box from any other source, same as with all other bo=\r\nxes.  I know many have a problem with Moon, and I can understand that, but =\r\nthere seems to be a level, or group of spirits that do work with him. I do =\r\nnot agree with the Edison thing, but... what do  ya do? \n\n   I had been pla=\r\nying with tones since box #5, and just this year tried to incorporate that =\r\ninto the design again as some of the voices were asking for eight signals. =\r\n46 and 47 have the eight tones, although I&#39;m not sure what frequency they a=\r\nre supposed to be, but eight suggests musical scales. So far it seems to do=\r\n little to enhance the voices. 46 and 47 are more like breadboarded systems=\r\n, they are not in cabinets, just mounted on a plywood base with a make shif=\r\nt front panel. I put four tone generators in 51, just cuz I had some extra =\r\nboard space. \n\n   Of course &quot;they&quot; want 46, it&#39;s the best box of this year,=\r\n and I&#39;ve been relucatant to give it up. Even in spirit communcations, you =\r\ncan tell which are the human spirits. Just cuz they are dead doesn&#39;t mean t=\r\nhey have any higher modivations. I remain reluctant to give this stuff so s=\r\nomeone else can claim it&#39;s an Edison invnetion, or to claim demons and shad=\r\now people come through box, or it opens portals, and on and on. I&#39;m pretty =\r\ndiscouraged with all things paranormal. I&#39;m not jumping up and rushing out =\r\njust cuz some voice said something, been there done that, and it&#39;s always d=\r\nisappointing. \n\n   Frank-S\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_00A1_01C9C25F.9CA265A0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18702&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;8 is also a symbol for Mercury, which also \nsymbolizes =\r\ncommunication.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;BORDER-=\r\nLEFT: #000000 2px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; MARGIN-LEFT=\r\n: 5px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; \ndir=3Dltr&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;---=\r\n-- Original Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV \n  style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial; BACKG=\r\nROUND: #e4e4e4; font-color: black&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; \n  &lt;A title=3Dpurplealiengi=\r\nrl@... \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:purplealiengirl@...&quot;&gt;Frank Sumption&lt;/A=\r\n&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A title=3Devp-itc@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:evp-itc@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;evp-itc@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&lt;/A&gt; ; &lt;A \n  title=3Dgrassharp@yahoogroups.com \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:grass=\r\nharp@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;grassharp@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;=\r\nFONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Tuesday, April 21, 2009 8:56 \n  AM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;=\r\nDIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; [EVP-ITC] This might chap so=\r\nme \n  hides.
