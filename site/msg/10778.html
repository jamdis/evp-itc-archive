Thats pretty shitty that a skeptic gets mad because you post a link to their website, let them bash me, and see what I say about it. If you can't run with the big dogs, stay on the porch and that is where they need to be is on the porch. .

  Sigh, unfortunately you were right in the beginning of what this close minded young person says. LOL Oh well, spirit has a path for her and there's nothing we can do. She sent me a private email, bashing me for posting her link she is obviously on this board and watches. Oh well, let it roll, and she will learn someday.
   
  Thanks for trying and sharing!!

    Just checked tonight and OF COURSE my comments were not approved and do not appear 
on the page. Apparently, only those posts in SUPPORT of her nonsense are being allowed. 
Imagine my surprise!! ;-) 

Thus, reinforcement for me to stick with my original position in the future, of not wasting 
time and energy on those who are not open to persuasive arguments when they aren't in 
favor of their close-minded position. 

LOL - Maybe I need a little reminder sticker on my computer: JUST SAY NO TO CYNICS!
