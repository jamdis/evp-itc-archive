I love vintage books, especially dealing with evp. I saw\n&gt; voices from the tapes here at a local secondhand shop, I didn&#39;t have\n&gt; any money to spare at the time, I think I will check back on it.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks\n&gt; Andy\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot;\n&gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Today while shopping in a used bookstore I picked up a couple of \nbooks \n&gt; &gt; having to do with spirit communication.\n&gt; &gt; The first, &quot;Voices from the Tapes&quot;, by Peter Bander and the \n&gt; &gt; second, &quot;Spirit Communications for the millions&quot;, by Doris \nHeather \n&gt; &gt; Buckley.\n&gt; &gt; They both look very interesting.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
