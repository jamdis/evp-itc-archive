Don't know if this "angel" person will work or not though, because  that 
c=
omet or brown drawf star is going to fly between the sun and earth dead  
c=

ur 
own orbit, and or make it so hot here, it's dead point between us is be=
tween  
sept. 24 through 30th, it will get closer to Earth and pass through=
 our 
orbit  again right in front of our planet right now Elenin as it's ca=
lled is 
about to  cross Earth's orbit in the next couple of days then it g=
ets close to 
mercury, it  may have it's own little circle of planets going=
 around it 
too, making things  worse.  Right now the people of Earth shoul=
d be praying, 
I'm not kidding  about this people, As it passes back right =
in front of earth 
and out of our  orbit again, it may pull to it or leave =
lots of stellar 
trash falling on us, you  should stay in the house or unde=
r cover because if it 
is a b.d.s. it could send  photons, and all that rad=

you don't believe me,  take a look for yourself wi=

the settings on it so you can  see where it is on =
