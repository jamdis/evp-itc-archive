So you see I have not, as you noted, said anything l=

 i think it helps keep us focused.  I just think you should be doing experi=

when you're wrong.  None of these experiments prove anything really.

doing experiments as well.  <br>

 For example, i will put something =

The fact in my mind is that they are saying something and just because they=
 didn't get your test right doesn't mean that it's any less fascinating to =
me that something talks that shouldn't.  They probably could care less what=
