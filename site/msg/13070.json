I&#39;m not sure of the\npurpose of your post though: was there part of my recommendation that\nyou think was wrong or could be improved?\n\nAnd I do hope, like you, that this is a forum where ideas and\nknowledge are shared regarding EVP/ITC, rather than those forums that\nrely on personal attacks or only on arguments-from-authority, instead\nof on objective testing and process.  The ideas I am sharing, in fact,\nrelate to EVP/ITC process, and in improving the objectivity of that\nresearch.   And again, I am more than happy to hear of what parts of\nthe ideas I have shared you think need improvement, or conversely, you\nhave found valuable. \n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, suzanne bibb &lt;suzyq6819@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I love this forum and do not like to get involved in the online mish\nmash . . .

I would still warn that, even in \n&gt; your experiment here, you yourself could become your own weak link in\n&gt; objectivity. As Cheri pointed out, even someone with the best \n&gt; intentions, who truly wants to provide accurate & honest information,\n&gt; is only human and subject to error. This is especially true if they\n&gt; have already decided which parts of their theories are right or wrong,\n&gt; without, again, objective testing. This is not a phenomenon that only\n&gt; effects the home experimenter, but experts in all fields, and they\n&gt; have learned of methods over time (such as the double blind testing I\n&gt; mentioned) to help weed out weak processes and develop and explore\n&gt; their theories on the firmest foundations possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I understand you are not trying to prove or test anything in this\n&gt; case, or use them to claim any kind of proof: you&#39;re just trying an\n&gt; experiment.

This is not a test, just a means of gathering \n&gt; &gt; audio with the use of material associated with a plane crash, at a \n&gt; &gt; location other than where the crash happened.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; All I asked them to do is provide five, 30 second audio files which \n&gt; &gt; they record while using the pieces of debris I will be sending them.\n&gt; &gt; I have faith in the researchers on this forum who have volunteered \n&gt; &gt; (six people so far have been selected). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whatever is found on the audio files will be studied, and since I \n&gt; &gt; will be the one listening to the recordings, and since I already know \n&gt; &gt; all the details of the incident, I have not set my mind to \n&gt; &gt; predetermine anything.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, a different type of test could have been done, and I could have \n&gt; &gt; hidden all information, but that would not have mattered for this \n&gt; &gt; effort, since the outcome is to only get the audio files, what ever \n&gt; &gt; may be found on them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks to those who have volunteered, I cound still use four more \n&gt; &gt; people too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike C.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Cheri Esperon &lt;cesperon@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have to agree with Rick, the less information in a situation like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this- the better. When we do investigations, I supply very little \n&gt; &gt; &gt; information to my team, as a matter of fact, I prefer to be kept in \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dark (no pun intended) as much as possible myself. This type of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; phenomenon is common in many fields, it is simply the power of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggestion, there are hundreds of document cases where a well \n&gt; &gt; meaning \n&gt; &gt; &gt; witness who truly wants to provide accurate & honest information, \n&gt; &gt; can be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; led by innocent suggestions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A really really good example of this is Derren Brown.

Now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that everyone knows they are from a plane crash, that \n&gt; &gt; will set\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prejudice of hearing plane/travel related words in the \n&gt; &gt; evp noises.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as you probably know, once that prejudice is active, \n&gt; &gt; once\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I say\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Doesn&#39;t that sound like someone saying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sssssstewardesssss ...&quot;, then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone hears THAT word, rather than just noise, or, for \n&gt; &gt; example\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Stewed ass&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And, if something does sound like a plane/travel related \n&gt; &gt; word, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will now be highlighted as an example of why this was a \n&gt; &gt; successful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test, and the other less-relevant words ignored. This is \n&gt; &gt; a form of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confirmation bias, which again, hurts the value of the \n&gt; &gt; test.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A more objective way would have been to send out both \n&gt; &gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; related\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; items, and completely innocuous items, with no \n&gt; &gt; explanation of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each was from, and see what kind of EVPs were returned on \n&gt; &gt; each.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Further, the returned EVPs should then be returned to \n&gt; &gt; someone to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaluate who ALSO doesn&#39;t know the origin of the objects, \n&gt; &gt; so that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they do not torture the interpretations into the forms you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hope and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expect them to be (again, plane/travel related). While \n&gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course lacks all kinds of controls, this would at least \n&gt; &gt; be a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; start to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defining a double-blind test, which is the gold standard \n&gt; &gt; for good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; research in this kind of research.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though you have tried to keep some of the \n&gt; &gt; information quiet,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is still quite a large opportunity for guessing and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coincidence. For example, one person might assume this \n&gt; &gt; was from an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; airshow (since, as you said, the event was very fast, and \n&gt; &gt; many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saw it), and so only send in EVPs that would be relevant \n&gt; &gt; to that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation (I.e. Not sending in child-like sounds, or \n&gt; &gt; sending in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sounds that sound like scratchy tower or inter-plane\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication) . If the crash was a commercial airline, \n&gt; &gt; then dozens\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of different people could have been killed, which means \n&gt; &gt; you could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find SOME relevancy no matter what noises are returned to \n&gt; &gt; you:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practical any word, name, or sound will support some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speculation that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it could have been relevant to one of those people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do think it is a good idea to test your theories. But \n&gt; &gt; my purpose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here is to suggest ways to help these tests be as \n&gt; &gt; objective as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, and for your efforts and testing to be as worth \n&gt; &gt; while as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, and for the youtube video results you make to \n&gt; &gt; be as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; valuable and bulletproof as possible. But I am concerned \n&gt; &gt; that the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; above scenario is full of opportunity for subjectivity and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misinterpretation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
