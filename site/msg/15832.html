<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, I totally agree about reinforcing fears.  Like, the more you think about something, the more power you give it.  But I hear so much about protection, I do it anyway.  I was just wondering if maybe there&#x27;s something to it, like the message Frank posted says.  Maybe it really does keep you safe.  Maybe because you do it and give it power it keeps you safe?  Something about the concept of expectation influencing the outcome of using the box?  I don&#x27;t know, just thinking out loud here.  I just wondered if anyone did the protection thing and still had negative stuff come through.

&gt; I don&#x27;t do any protection stuff, but did get this voice the other day about
&gt; a door. It might be a broadcast fragment, but in reverse it talks about &quot;see
&gt; &#x27;em here&quot;. I think doing protection junk only serves to reinforce your
&gt; fears.
