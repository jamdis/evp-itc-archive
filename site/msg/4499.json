Bruce, you&#39;re getting some awesome EVP&#39;s in real-time - \nanswering your questions! I&#39;m thrilled at your progress! I&#39;ve gotten \nsome saying my first and some saying my last names!!!! That, \nconvinces me it&#39;s not a radio station but actual voices/EVP&#39;s!!! I \njust wish I could find some inexpensive amplified speakers for the RS \n12-469 I have that could get the volume up (with the speakers I have, \nI have to turn up the RS Hack volume to max, to hear/record)! The \nPhilips Sterio speakers at Rite Aid, ($13.) are round for PC, MP3, & \nCD&#39;s it says on the box, I&#39;m wondering IF I should get them to try \nout? =Judy=&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; i&#39;m is proud to present Cause Effect, a series about real people \nmaking a difference.\n&gt; http://im.live.com/Messenger/IM/MTV/?source=text_Cause_Effect\n&gt;"}
