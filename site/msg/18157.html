<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>DAH! again. There&#x27;s way to much expectation created in trying to guess, so
participants minds interfere with whatever spirit communication there might
be. You do not understand how this communcations works, nor do you
understand the effects of the observer, you can not seperate the observer
from the event in the pararnormal. therefore any results are invalid--before
you go puffing your chest out thinking how clever you are in debunking
spirit communication. Even your own expectation that no valid information
will be received is enough to block all information. But as usual,
skeptic/debunker ignore all!

&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Experiment 2 - RESULTS!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Thanks to everyone who participated in Experiment 2.
&gt;
&gt; On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor,
&gt; right in front of me, and left it there until noon Denver time on Monday,
&gt; 7/19/2010. This experiment asked for participants to determine what that
&gt; object was. Vague or partial answers would not be counted (for example, just
&gt; giving a color, shape, size, what it&#x27;s made of, etc): we&#x27;re looking for what
&gt; it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#x27;t count.
&gt; Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means
&gt; they chose.
&gt;
&gt; In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the start of
&gt; the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.
&gt; The idea with this file is that you could download it at the beginning of
&gt; the experiment and &#x27;keep it safe&#x27; on your computer. Then at the end of the
&gt; experiment, I would post the password so you can reveal the contents of the
&gt; file. That way, you were in control of the original image during the entire
&gt; time, not me.
&gt;
&gt; Passworded pdf:
&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.pdf
&gt;
&gt; The password for that file is: 2plus2isFour
&gt; Instructions, if you need them for the other files, are also in that RJ
&gt; folder.
&gt;
&gt; So to the results:
&gt;
&gt; Number of participants: 6
&gt; Total tries: 29
&gt; Ambiguous answers: 0
&gt; Correct answers: 0
&gt;
&gt; Object: Chair
&gt; Object picture:
&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.jpg
&gt;
&gt; As a little side experiment, on Monday I also asked if anyone had gotten
&gt; any answers that might indicate an article of clothing (though I did not say
&gt; why I was asking). One theory is that the human operator can be influenced
&gt; by things they already know or suspect, and so interpret audio with their
&gt; own personal &#x27;educated guesses&#x27;, that would differ from what they would hear
&gt; had they not known those things. This side experiment did indicate some
&gt; support for that theory, since before I mentioned &#x27;articles of clothing&#x27;, no
&gt; one included an article of clothing in their results. But after I mentioned
&gt; it, several reports of clothing began to appear. I did not add these tries
&gt; to the results above.
&gt;
&gt; If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let me
&gt; know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this experiment.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;

DAH! again. The e&#x27;s way o much expec a ion c ea ed in ying o guess, so pa icipan s minds in e e e wi h wha e e spi i communica ion he e migh be. You do no unde s and how his communca ions wo ks, no do you unde s and he e ec s o he obse e , you can no sepe a e he obse e om he e en in he pa a no mal.  he e o e any esul s a e in alid--be o e you go pu ing you ches ou hinking how cle e you a e in debunking spi i communica ion.
