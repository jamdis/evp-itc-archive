I bought one of the RS radios today, =\r\nand found I can leave the mute pin intact, and instead cut the VT line, tun=\r\ning the radio with an external tuning voltage. The only(minor) problem is t=\r\nhat the VT signal for this radio goes from -(minus) 3 volts for the bottom =\r\nof the band, AM, or FM, to + 3 volts for the top of the band. A triangle wa=\r\nve generator is very cable of doing this, and you don&#39;t need to level shift=\r\n it like I do for my other boxes. You can also get low voltage ops, or run =\r\nthe op amps for the trianlge generator on a couple 9 volt batteries. I thin=\r\nk what I would do is make the tuning adapter board, add an audio amplifier,=\r\n and mount the radio in a box with the front exposed. \n \n I like the sound =\r\nquality of the RS sahck radios, so it&#39;s worth doing for quick, and compact =\r\n&quot;box&quot;.\n \n Frank-S\n_________________________________________________________=\r\n________\nWindows Live Hotmail is giving away Zunes.\nhttp://www.windowslive-=\r\nhotmail.com/ZuneADay/?locale=3Den-US&ocid=3DTXT_TAGLM_Mobile_Zune_V3\r\n--_bcc414b9-6df4-4005-82ff-126c8c65a9de_\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;\n.hmmessage P\n{\nmargin:0px;\npadding:0px\n}\nbody.hmmessa=\r\nge\n{\nFONT-SIZE: 10pt;\nFONT-FAMILY:Tahoma\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body class=3D&#39;=\r\nhmmessage&#39;&gt;\nHi All;&lt;BR&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;\n&nbsp;I was up at the Stanley, and many =\r\nhad the RS &#39;469&#39;s, and the major complaint is that chuffing sound.
