I dont have much of an ego (do I???), dont want to make a name for myself, no need for fame, no need for an "audience" and plenty of results LOL so go figure.
   
  I agree, cant take it all too seriously, all we can do is listen and share when we want to.
   
  I think you are right that they do feed on our energy to some extent, join/merge whatever one wants to call it.
