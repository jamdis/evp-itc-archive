I personally don&#39;t like to focus\n&gt; on evil entities, even though I believe 100% that lower astrals\n&gt; exist. Not only that, Tibetan shamans, among others, have repeatedly\n&gt; shown that thought forms can be given form and a measure of life.\n&gt;\n&gt; The way I see it, if we keep a higher focus, such things as rage,\n&gt; hate, and destruction among other things will be far removed. Ouija\n&gt; Boards have many times been the source of horrible experiences. Just\n&gt; from listening to all the hundreds of callers on C2C over the years,\n&gt; I&#39;d say over 95% of the stories weren&#39;t good.\n&gt;\n&gt; George did make a good statement to the effect that it&#39;s not good\n&gt; giving a loaded gun to a child.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lance\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, lisby@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He may very well have changed it. Maybe he&#39;ll tell us why himself,\n&gt; if he chooses, since he&#39;s a list member.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Can I ask you what personal experiences you have had with evil\n&gt; entities that make you so concerned? Not other people&#39;s alledged\n&gt; experiences, but your own? I&#39;m really curious.
