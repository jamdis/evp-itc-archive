Haven&#39;t done any electronice for a few decades but I thought I&#39;d give it a go..\n&gt; I know most of the principles I was hoping to get some practical advise from the forum.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers \n&gt; \n&gt; Steve\n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Yes, I remember Steve! There&#39;s still the occasional argument and\n&gt; &gt; debunker/skeptic that shows up from time to time, and I have my moods in my\n&gt; &gt; old age.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  My focus has always been just the boxes, Just trying to make the stuff\n&gt; &gt; keeps me too busy. I don&#39;t have alot of interested in haunted objects or\n&gt; &gt; locations, but thanks to TV, like Ghost Hunters, and ghost adventures, I see\n&gt; &gt; enough to make me wonder, plus discussions here.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Sun, Jan 16, 2011 at 2:36 PM, steve gunn &lt;steve@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Frank, hi group I&#39;m glad to see there&#39;s a place this topic can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discussed without the nasty junk I&#39;ve seen spouted in a few places on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; web and Frank I&#39;m sorry to see you have to suffer that my friend you do not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deserve it..\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I closed the old forum where Frank kindly came along and shared his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; information with us a few years ago but great to see this forum and thanks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for accepting me..\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We do work with haunted dolls and spirits. My wife has 100 plus dolls and a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; non commercial site haunteddolls.net where we show them and talk about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them. The few EVP&#39;s are a little out of date - they were got in the usual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way but it would be cool to have a ghost box because the spiritual events in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this place are 24/7..\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Apologies if I&#39;ve missed it and there&#39;s already a post on the subject but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whats the best approach to a randomly scanning receiver as opposed to one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that just scans sequentially ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks !
