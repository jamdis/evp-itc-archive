As far as I am concerned, for what it is worth-you seem to be going about i=
t the right way. As long as you remain open mindedly skeptical about any kn=
ew info, just as you did with the messages that were for you, there is no p=
roblem with it at all, IMO.

It sounds like you don't discount it and you d=
on't buy into it, you just file it away to see what comes of it later.

    There is no doubt in my mind abou=

 my own sanity. But time and time again I have learned much more than I eve=
r expected to. For me its become more than about contact with my dead loved=

          I would definitely call that proof. The strength of the proof is=
 in the part that you knew nothing about what the message would mean to the=
 person, or if it a message for you, it was some fact that you had not know=
n prior.

          IMO, in this case there is no way it would be a case ma=
trixing or hearing what you wanted or expected to hear, that it was real in=
formation conveyed through an intelligent source.

cross the below exchange on a forum. It talks about using the box to find m=

>> <BR>> I was googling about AM radio reception, 
            and I =
came across the below exchange on a forum. It talks about 
            usin=
g the box to find missing persons (which I didn't know was 
            pos=
sible), and the conversation mentions hearing specific voice 
            i=
nflections and recognizing a dead person's specific voice on the 
         =
   box. My question is, do any of you get a recognizable voice? The 
      =
      voices I get always sound robotic, although I do get clearly male or =

            female voices. <BR>> <BR>> <A href=3D"http://www.itcbrid=
