Hehehe Yes lets please not press that button people here have enough fear already. And if you do have fear perhaps this work isnt for you. 
   
  I dont exactly feel it is opening a portal so much as it allows those who wish to communicate the opportunity to do so. They are always around us, it has nothing to do with me pressing any buttons or turning anything on, they are just around.. all the time... and there are ways of making speech audible so its heard by those who cant hear them without use of tools. One of my early messages was "we're always with you wherever you are"
   
  They do often talk of a gate/window/door/tunnel/bridge that opens, terminology varies. They have spoken of ushering some thru the gate, or making use of a window of opportunity to open up communication with us or with each other.
   
  Maybe they just werent done talkin or had more to say. So many here have had instances where they make use of other ways to get in touch, leaving messages on our answering machines or apports being found in strange locations. Radios turning on just in time to play a meaningful song. Images on televisions. Little messages just to let us know they are around. Often they pass messages thru other researchers they know you will communicate with or are already talking with.
   
  It's all very interesting but one thing they have always been very adamant about is to have no fear, it only attracts unwanted energies and if theres a button they can press they will press it. If you have no fear then they have no power to scare you. For those who are afraid or looking into it because its "spooky" perhaps this work isnt for you.
   
  I find negative personalities exist here as much as anywhere. I do what I can to block/neutralize my interaction with them on this side and the group does what it can to block interaction with them on thier end. Most who have been at this a while have found they have repeat visitors coming thru as well as the multitude of strangers popping up to say hello or yell something out. I tend to focus more on the repeaters, call them friends family guides angels spirits whatever label is needed. I find they have better things to talk about and thier purpose matches my own.

          for all researchers,

THIS IS NOT FOR THE REASON OF PUSHING A PANIC BUTTON OR A MATTER OF 
GIVING IN TO FEAR. 

It is simply an incident that I feel researchers should be aware of 
as a possibility. Given in my opinion the boxes do open a portal due 
to the connection necessary for real time two way communication, and 
the wide spread belief that entities can and do manipulate physical 
objects when in the presence of them.

I have just been made aware of a situation that has happened to a 
fairly new researcher whom I believe to be honest and forthcoming.

the incident involved the aftermath of a regular RS box session. The 
researcher had finished his session with the practice of asking that 
any entities that may have traveled through the box, return and asked 
for conformation, then proceeded to end the session and turn the box 
off. he was assured that he turned the box off by going back to the 
recording after the incident and validating verbally that he did in 
fact turn off the box.

He left the room for a few moments , when he returned he allegedly 
witnessed a white cloud move across the room and noticed that his RS 
box was turned on and running.

This is actually the first instance I have encountered where the 
possibility of an entity that may have

purposely stayed behind to turn the box back on and let other 
entities through. matter of fact

that concept has not occurred to me before. but now sounds very 
possible.

This may even happen at times we are never aware of and they actually 
turn the box on and when 
whatever comes through is through they turn it off again and we are 
none the wiser.

I will definitely address this in my sessions, what I suggest is 
until we come to a mutual agreement among researchers
on this occurrence, I think it best that when we end a session we 
remove at least one battery from the box to prevent it being turned
back on.
