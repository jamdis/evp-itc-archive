<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, few want to hear it, but there is absolutely no need to go to 
so called haunted locations. I suggest you try working at home, 
patiently, and with a verity of methods. Usually you need somekind of 
background sound that &quot;they&quot; can use to form voices, in the past that 
was white noise, and that will still work, but now various swept 
radios are being used for louder, and clearer messages. 

 I have tried for years to get people out of that crazy ghost hunter 
mentality--to no avail!

&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have been to lots of haunted places like Gettysburg, Eastern 
State 
&gt; Penitentiary, and many other documented haunted places and have not 
&gt; captured any evp&#x27;s at all. Just wondering if it is just me or am I 
&gt; doing it all wrong? I bring a voice recorder that uses a standard 
&gt; recording tape and can&#x27;t hear anything unusual. Any suggestions on 
how 
&gt; I can try to get some voices would be great. I am open-minded to 
the 
&gt; spirit world and have seen spirits but not heard from them. Would 
like 
&gt; to try to capture some voices. Any suggestions would be great!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks very much,
&gt; 
&gt; Jan
