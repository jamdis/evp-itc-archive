I found a\nbattery powered unit and now am experiencing the clicking sounds. Can\nanyone tell me where to find the small single speaker that was shown\nin the UFO Geeks hack? I think the batteries are causing the clicking.\nOh also. I attempted to use the radio in a very active cemetary and\nthe radio immediately locked on the am station 66. There was no sounds\ncoming from it and each time I set it to search it would go back and\nlock. Did I have a hit from the other side and was too green to see that?\nThanks for any and all input, would love to get this equipment going\nin the right direction as I keep getting signs of visitations and I\nfeel as if I is my grandma trying to communicate with me.\nthanks,\nMichelle"}
