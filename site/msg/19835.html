&gt;  I&#x27;m thinking there is faces embedded in sound, it&#x27;s related to speech, and
&gt; not just EVP. It seems to be a normal function of our own minds(living or
&gt; dead), the same as reverse speech. I found some faces in old EVPs from boxes
&gt; and also in music files. The ones from Evanescence are pretty impressive in
&gt; person, and do not seem to be intentionaly embedded.

&gt;  I know, it&#x27;s not ghost hunters, and most don&#x27;t want to have to think.
&gt; I think most want this stuff in a neat little box, all well defined, all
&gt; rules and protocols known, but it just won&#x27;t stay in one box, or universe
&gt; for that matter.

Dear Frank,

I think that I see what you mean.  I mean no offense, but I it would be helpful to see something a little more definitive that couldn&#x27;t be mistaken for matrixing.  Is this possible?  Is it just me?
