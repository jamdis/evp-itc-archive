<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just about everything.

They are individual energies or spirits. I spoke with them for about 6  
weeks daily. I&#x27;d talk to a male sounding energy, though they have no  
gender. They said they had never been incarnated or had a physical  
body. They lied a lot. They seemed to get a huge kick out of pranks  
and trying to control. Also trying to scare me, friends, and family  
with various paranormal phenomenon. A favorite was coming through  
radios calling my name. This generally happened in my home or in the  
car. They especially loved shouting at me through the radio while  
people who have no idea about EVP/ITC research were around. Can you  
imagine how difficult it is to explain why your name, which is unique  
to begin with (Wisteria) is coming through a car radio? To top that  
off, they&#x27;d announce they had an extra terrestrial that had to talk to  
me NOW. They tried to tell me what to eat and that I should remarry my  
exhusband. lol! Basically they really tried to control me.

I have a HUGE sense of humor. Much of it was funny, some of it was  
terrible - they will say things like &quot;you need to kill so &amp; so because  
it will correct your karma - if you don&#x27;t do this, you will be doomed  
- blah blah...&quot; That&#x27;s not funny. Some people of a different character  
might take them seriously.

I&#x27;m an independent person and I think for myself. This is a good thing  
in this kind of research. They love fear. They&#x27;d display amazing feats  
of poltergeist activity and get a huge kick out of scaring me or  
others. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of weird things mind you, but voices generated  
out of thin air - literally and the manipulation of electrical  
equipment is very bizarre when you aren&#x27;t used to it.

The last straw was one of them telling me my mother would have a  
stroke in my kitchen and it &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be pretty&quot;. It never happened  
and they were so obnoxious that I contacted Lisa (AAEVP) for help. She  
told me about Mr. Smith, Erland, and another man who had the same  
experiences and this group claiming to be The Fish Group. Erland  
helped the most. I can&#x27;t remember why we came up with the NDE  
connection. I wonder now if Lisa came up with that, but I don&#x27;t  
remember. It seems that a common side effect of those who have crossed  
over and come back, that they are very naturally clairaudient after. I  
assume there is something different about our light or energy. Perhaps  
we&#x27;re changed somehow.
??? I just don&#x27;t know - yet!

Lisa mentioned them as being the Fish Group and that was the first I&#x27;d  
heard of them. I have to wonder if they simply claim this as they not  
only lie (A LOT) but are egotistical beings and enjoy their illusion  
of power and control. I have heard other researchers mention a Fish  
Group who are not of ill intent and are very nice - very scientific,  
and trying just as hard as we are to make contact. So I have to wonder  
if the Fish Group I, Erland, and a few others experienced are simply  
claiming to be the other group, but in fact, are nothing more than  
something akin to a band of malevolent faeries making false claims.

Frank, if you&#x27;re reading this, maybe you could share your own Fish  
experiences to add clarity?

What was interesting for me, is that in hind sight, though they were  
just awful at times, at other times they seemed like children who  
simply act terribly to get attention.

What stopped the crazy phenomenon I was experiencing? Not recording.  
Not recording or talking to them at all and ignoring their antics  
seemed to thicken the veil once again. I also prayed for them and sent  
them love. I still do.

So on one hand it was an awful experience, and on the other, I  
experienced things so incredible (with witnesses) that I&#x27;ll be forever  
grateful. the good news is that no matter how hairy things get, we are  
protected and have free will and nothing can interfere with that  
unless we allow it to. So if your lights start flashing, electrical  
equipment starts acting possessed, and gusts of wind come out of your  
car vents clearly and papers, etc... start flying around, simply enjoy  
it. lol! It can&#x27;t hurt you as far as I know as long as you keep your  
head about you, stay grounded and remain with a loving heart.

Ah the wonders of the unknown becoming known! Aren&#x27;t we lucky?
