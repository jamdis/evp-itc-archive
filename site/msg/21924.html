<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Here are two recordings I made using Steve&#x27;s file at
http://stevehultay.com/evpsoftware.html*. *These recordings are interesting
because I get several really blatant messages that seem relevant to me
personally, they are incredibly clear in spots, and also because it seems
that the responses are better heard when you play the file back at roughly
150% of the normal speed. I haven&#x27;t altered these files in any way. These
are both stored on SoundCloud.

In this first file, done August 25, 2011 at 10:00 a.m. It seems like they&#x27;re
addressing two things: (1) my worries that something I don&#x27;t like is living
in my basement, and (2) my concern over further developing my psychic
abilities. Before this recording, I did a protection prayer and asked that
the &quot;angels&#x27; or beings of love and light protect me, my family, and this
property.

:01 Here&#x27;s Tim
:02 Will Help. You are worried. 8-0-0
:04 Urkel hates it out here, now hell on Earth
:08 You worried here are? Here orb stays til the end.

:56 Put up your ?? out over there to help you a little.

Here&#x27;s the second recording, done at 11:11 a.m. on August 25, 2011. Before
this recording, I asked that they tell me who they are and to give me some
detail about themselves.  At :12, they say &quot;She finds our obits.&quot; This is
true. I found two obituaries for the man who built this house and his
brother, both of whom died within the last year or so. Further on, they talk
about animal therapy, which I had once discussed with my husband doing with
our two golden retrievers, both of whom were locked out of the room while I
recorded.

:02 Well, I&#x27;m here to help people out.
:04 Here there are people that help me
:05 They faked it. the whole outfit.
:07 I fear the outcome.
:09 Down stairs I hear them
:12 She finds our obit
:13 You have to warn people that there&#x27;s a terrible quake.
:14 The people end earth and they&#x27;re worried.
:17 They&#x27;ll thank you
:18 Yeah, he killed Elliott
:20 You killed Ike. I fell over, I got killed. It&#x27;s Earl.?
:24 There are people in poor houses.
:26 I am worried
:27 Here people are in poor health.
:29 Year ?? Ella
:30 You might hear Hello
:32 You bet I miss Elmo
:34 Yeah, that&#x27;s hysterical
:35 Layed out here
:36 Hard to deal with this

:38 Wait, hear my fill
:40 Lady, you are a therapist
:42 Do animal therapy. Potent.
:44 Arf! For it will help you!
:46 Olay never helps
:48 You pick the mutants
:49 He&#x27;ll devise it
:50 Belarc (or Alert?)
:51 Couldn&#x27;t find any peace
:52 They found the colitis, and yet more bills.
