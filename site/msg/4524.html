The number seven seems to be coming up again.  I have attached 2 files from a session tonight.  They clearly say "Seven".  We proceed to ask the next question, in the second clip.  I believe it says "happens, accident...death...to date...dead"
   
  This is a long clip, so listen to the second question as well.
   
  I was wondering if any one else got something to this effect?
   
  Looking forward to your comments!
