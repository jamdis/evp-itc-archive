&gt; Yes.
&gt;
&gt; Also, it is currently set to only be viewable after the test is over, and
&gt; on Windows.
&gt; If anyone needs a Mac version, I could arrange that too.

&gt;   Can you go to the home page of this EVP-ITC group?
&gt; Select on the Files folder?
&gt; Then select on the RJ folder?
&gt;
&gt; If you can&#x27;t, I will email you the file directly.

&gt; Neither of these links work, RJ what do I do, are you going to finish this

&gt;   Considering the attacks people continue to make against me on here just
&gt; for having a different opinion of people&#x27;s results, I think you will
&gt; understand why I will not post my name and address here.
&gt;
&gt; Try anyway though.  I don&#x27;t know how your personal beliefs here work, but
&gt; others seem to get messages about people they&#x27;ve never heard of, or places
&gt; they&#x27;ve never seen.
&gt;
&gt; I would also suggest anyone who tries this experiment, to post your results
&gt; on the list here rather than sending them personally to me - so I won&#x27;t be
&gt; accused of losing any.

&gt; What is your name RJ? and where do you live?  There are probably tons of
&gt; RJ&#x27;s in this world, and if i am going to ask any of my guides if they want
&gt; to play this game with you, I will not ask them to run around the world a
&gt; lookin for you. sf

&gt; I have placed a little something on top of my computer monitor, right in
&gt; front of me. It is now 7/10/2010. I will leave it there 4 days, and remove
&gt; it Noon Denver time, on Wednesday, 7/14/2010.
&gt;
&gt; All you have to do is ask your boxes/spirits/ aliens/etc, what it is.
&gt;
&gt; I have taken a picture of it, and posted it to the files section here, so
&gt; there is no way I can squirm out of the results:

&gt;
&gt; Please do not try to open the file before noon Wednesday. But feel free to
&gt; download it to your computer beforehand, so you can be sure I won&#x27;t change
&gt; it during, or after, the test.
&gt;
&gt; Answers anyone reveals after noon Wednesday don&#x27;t count. Partial answers
&gt; (like just the color, or shape, or some emotion vibe) don&#x27;t count. Just tell
&gt; me what it is.
&gt;
&gt; Best of Luck. I hope for this to be a regularly occurring experiment, and I
&gt; hope we all can learn from the results.
