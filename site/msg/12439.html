<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yep, that is why I left traditional investigation behind, for the same
reasons you listed. The paranormal field is truly a circus of ego and
profiteering. Not many folks give a damn about helping or elevating
their fellow researcher. Seems to be different here, lots of folks
help. :)

&gt; They ruin this field of research. It&#x27;s too bad so many are willing to  
&gt; pay and follow such egomaniacs when, as Frank S. said, anyone can  
&gt; spend a few bucks at Radio Shack and record with no prior experience.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps people should start boycotting these self proclaimed experts.  
&gt; If no one shows up or gives them money, they&#x27;ll just disappear  
&gt; eventually. They will eventually disappear anyway as once people  
&gt; actually start researching on their own, they&#x27;ll see right through  
&gt; these people.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone can record. It&#x27;s easy. No training required. As for the boxes,  
&gt; Franks sent me maybe 2 emails of maybe 3 sentences of how to fiddle  
&gt; with the knobs. I figured the rest out and my goodness, NO CHARGE!

&gt; &gt; Don&#x27;t laugh at this idea! A lot of paranormal groups do just this  
&gt; &gt; and charge a good deal and then use the money to further their &quot;work.&quot;
