Hey Zack,

I have to take total responsibility for this screw up.  The sell=
er claimed a friend gave her the cellphone new, and she never opened the bo=
x because she got another phone she liked better.  She could absolutely be =
telling the truth, but it sounded doubtful to me that she wouldn't at least=
 have tested it out before representing it as brand new and in perfect cond=
ition.  I'm ashamed to admit I paid well over $200. for it after S/H, and m=
uch more than that after the fruitless repairs, extra battery, etc.  I gave=
 her positive feedback the day it arrived because it appeared to be working=
, and like I said, I simply couldn't believe anything might be wrong with i=
t.  After our email exchanges and her suggestion that I contact ATT about t=
he problem, I got the feeling she had probably known all along it wasn't wo=
rking right, but it was too late by that time to demand restitution, file a=
 complaint, or even ammend my positive feedback.  It was an extremely expen=
sive lesson because I couldn't afford to buy my son the cellphone in the fi=
rst place, but I DID learn!  

You know, I watched eBay sprout up literally=
 down the street from where I grew up in San Jose.   I've always had great =
experiences buying stuff that way, but I can't even go to the website anymo=
re because of this.   I'm glad your experience turned out happy!

Robin

  Hi Robin,

  Some eBay sellers buy large quantities of thin=
gs and sell them for a small 
  profit. It could be he didn't know that par=
ticular unit was bad. That 
  happens sometimes and it's unfortunate it hap=
pened to you.

  How much did you pay for it on eBay?

  I bought a GPS eng=
ine on eBay for $25 a few years ago and it was DOA. 
  The eBay seller sent=
 me a new one, no questions asked, no request for 
  return of the bad one,=
 no cost or shipping charges, no nothing from me. 
  I defintely gave him p=
ositive feedback!

  Zack
