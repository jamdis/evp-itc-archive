the other vo=

stuff to=
 worry about already?  I just don't enjoy  encouraging them to keep 
it up,=

very good example it's like what a philosophy  professor once told a 
class=
 back I took one, students could  understand him, oh yes, he spoke clearly =

perfect English, but the man spoke 8  languages fluently, wrote several 
b=
ooks;  "I speak to lift this  class up to my level of understanding, so you=
 
will learn, I will not  lower myself to your level, you are all here to

learn."    Difficult class?  Very much so, and no student ever managed to g=
et an  
A or B in his class one was lucky to get a C + in that class, and I=
 had 3.9 
in  all of my undergraduate work, and a 4.0 in what PhD credits I=
 
accumulated.   But of all the science classes I took, the biology's, chem=

Snowfire, based on your hearing of all the negative  entities, do you think=
 
listening to them could cause a person to become  ill, or more negative? =
If
