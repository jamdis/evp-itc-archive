<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rees.  I suppose if it&#x27;s the old 12-469 (the one that doesn&#x27;t click-click-click) that&#x27;s a 
reasonable price, considering the units are no longer available commercially, and the old 12-
470&#x27;s are very scarce.  I haven&#x27;t tried the 20-125 or the 12-820.  I guess for $50, actually 
LESS than, one of these would be the way to go, since both are readily available.  Perhaps the 
majority of people aren&#x27;t yet aware that these other units are also hackable?

&gt; On ebay I just saw a RS12-469 in a auction and the bid was $49.95.  I can&#x27;t believe this 
shit that people try to pull off.</pre>
