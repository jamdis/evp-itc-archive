<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello All:

I am Rob Fitzgerald and I host the Dead Science Show at
www.deadscience.com.  I  I should be receiving my mini box in about
two weeks.  I would like to list my proposed method of documentation I
will be using for my sessions and get your feedback if you will.
First the mini box will be fed to a Zoom H4 so both the box and my
audio can be recorded in very high bit rate on two separate channels.
 The entire session will be recorded on a Sony DSR-200a dvcam recorder
with an audio feed from the H4.  I will also have my data logger
running and that captures my tri-field meter data and the magnetic
field surrounding the area, the air temperature and the gamma
radiation level present.  This is all saved and displayed on a monitor
and will also be fed to digital video recorder. Furthermore I will
have my thermal imager watching the session and also record that video
feed.  All feeds will be time code synchronized and captured. In the
end the entire session will be saved to a DVD for study and archiving.
 I will also of course keep copious notes on the session in a log book
and include my personal feelings and emotions from the session.

I know this may seem over the top  and not at all necessary for a
session to be successful, but I like to have as much data at hand to
both rule in and out all possibilities.  The sessions should also make
for some interesting shows.
Thanks for your time and for letting me in the group.</pre>
