As for the 820, instead \nof doing the hack, I cut the trace formthe VT wire, and insert an \nexternal sweep voltage. Steve m ight be able to give better \ninstructions for doing the hack on the 820. \n\n I generally don&#39;t ask questions, but I do all my sessions from \nhome. I just announce out loud that I am doing an EVP recording, \neven when I&#39;m just testing a system, and start recording. &quot;They&quot; \nseem to know when I&#39;ll turn on a box, and what I need/want to know. \nI have picked up radios in thrift stroes, and when they have \nbatteries int them I turn them on, &quot;they&quot; will talk as I spin the \ndial (slowly).  \n\n There seems to be more than spirits out there. There&#39;s what&#39;s \ncalled ehterics, or Astral entities. It&#39;s kind of the next level up \nfor the physical. That&#39;s where alot of supposed ET contacts come \nfrmm--I think. There also seems to be almost infinite level of \nspirit. \n\n For me, it&#39;s just the voices that keep me intrigued. \n\nFRank-S\n \n&gt;\n&gt;"}
