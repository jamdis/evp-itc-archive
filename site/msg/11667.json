The hack was looking me in the face from\nday one and I didn&#39;t even realize it. Mike&#39;s videos are a HUGE help!\nI&#39;ll be putting my box together tomorrow, provided I can find the\nradios. lol.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       __________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Yahoo!
