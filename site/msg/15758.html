Hi Misty,



I joined=
 this group a long time ago...pretty much a silent observer. I don't even r=
ead all of the emails I get on updates. I thought when I saw the whole name=
 calling thing it was some sensitive person whining about a spirit saying c=
olorful things to them...then I read a few. ARE THEY SERIOUS. Please know t=
here are many people who agree with you and Frank and agree whole heartedly=
 you should delete the faint of heart...LOL. Can you imagine how they would=
 react to a simple BOO from a voice from beyond? LOL...what fools.
