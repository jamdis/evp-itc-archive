        Seems Yahoo isn't letting anyone play the files that we post, so i've attached them to this e-mail.
   
  Files:
   
  "Bless You"---That's what i heard and was pretty funny and polite for them to say that.
   
  "It's For Steve"---No question was asked before this message
   
  "Lisa"---"Yeah"---"Maybe it's supposed to be hard"---This ones a little rough, but i hear it
   
  "Punk"---"Blake"-"Blake"---"His Face"------Blake is a guy i work with who is helping me develop some new stuff, it's funny that they mentioned him.  Blake is not a common name to be mentioned on the radio either.
   
  "Purple"---"Marcus"---"Chris"---"Chris"---"Beavis Hicks"----I screwed up most of the names in real time, but i'm only human.  The upside is that the files are getting longer, meaning better conversations.  Maybe frank knows a beavis hicks.
   
  "You car's still running"---I did this 5 minute session while getting ready for work this morning and my car was outside running to warm up.  I guess they picked up on that.  This file is a little rough as well.
   
  _____________
   
   
  I also included the two from Frank's video that were very clear messages.
   
  "Where's Purple" and "We're friggin' People"
   
   
  Hope you can make out some of these,
   
  -Steve H.
   
   
  p.s. Hang tight for the second set of files.  I have one nerve left and Yahoo is jumping on it like a trampoline.  I can only send a couple at a time.
