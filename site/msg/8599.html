<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Oh, Kristin.  I&#x27;m SO sorry to read of your loss.  That is awful.  I think it is strange how grief 
can whip back on us, sometimes seemingly out of the blue, as if no time has passed.  Once in 
a while, for no apparent reason, I will have one of those days where it just brings me to my 
knees, even after years.  Four months is not a long time at all and it is perfectly 
understandable how your grief could be so raw in this moment.

Sending big &#x27;feel better&#x27; hugs your way!!!

Margaret

&gt; As many of you know I lost both my niece and my nephew about 4 months
&gt; ago. I was doing fine but this morning was rough.  I spent time
&gt; talking to their mom and I sorta lost it after.  I did a session and
&gt; the clips are from that.  Look for them in a a few..
