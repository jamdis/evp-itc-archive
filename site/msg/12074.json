Hope you enjoy them.\n\nIf you&#39;re up for some good live radio programming, head over to\nwww.para-x.com for live shows on a nightly basis.

They have a chat room where you can interact\nwith the hosts and other listeners during the shows. They have great\nparanormal guests and cover a wide range of topics from the paranormal\nfield. That&#39;s all I&#39;ll say about it, but it is awesome.\n\nWell, I hope you guys enjoy our EVPs. Let us know what you think!\n\nChad \nGA.S.P."}
