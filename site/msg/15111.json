I say &quot;where&#39;d she go&quot; I was talking about a female Cardinal Bird that flew off a telephone pole. Is very low audio-should hear Big Girl though. Play 3 or 4 times with headphones will help. \n&gt; \n&gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jim%27s%20RR-DR60%20EVP%27s/I%20want%20my%20paaaw_big_girl.mp3 \n&gt; \n&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; clockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt;\n&gt;"}
