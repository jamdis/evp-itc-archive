Except you can not deny something without giving the 
other person a chance=
 for rebuttal.

But I hate flame wars so I'll just say that I have studied
=
actual books as opposed to the internet and Satan is as
real as God or Mich=
ael or Raphael.  

Of course the existence of all of the above is HIGHLY 
d=
ebatable :))

Job has the best explanation of Satan and his role on Earth
J=
ust in case you wanted to research it.


Now back to boxes...

I was wonder=
ing something,.  Actually 2 things.

1) I have been trying mine for a week =
or so.  How long does it
take most of you before you get something?  I've g=
otten one word
things but they are subject to interpetation as to whether t=
hey were
real answers.

2) Testing echo boxes seems to make it better but d=
oes anyone
know the correct dimensions?  I could not find it anywhere.

Tha=
nks,

Don

No flaming here. 

I don't believe, as history proves, that Satan is any=
thing more than an idea of the early church's to 
cast blame and scare peop=
le. For me, he doesn't exist.

And yes, Satan is a made up character of the=
 early church. This is well documented historically. 
You can Google the to=
pic on your own if you wish. He's a mythic character no more real than Zeus=
 or Apollo and 
only as real as you want to make him in your own mind.

I'l=
l decline further comment as the original conversation was between Marty & =
myself and not a list topic. I'm sure Misty would appreciate it if we decli=
ned further debate.
