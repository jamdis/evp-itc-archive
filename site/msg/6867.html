I very much value and appreciate everyone participating in this forum.   My=
 selfish motive in wanting to contact the other side is my hope to hear fro=
m loved ones who have passed.  I couldn't admit this a couple of years ago =
because the idea of being contacted by my dead parents terrified me.  Now I=
 long for it.  I believe guardian angels have intervened on my behalf in th=
e past and continue to watch over me.  I've had mystic experiences during t=
imes of crisis that make me know a spiritual world exists.  How wonderful i=
t must be to hear their voices first hand!  I'll remind myself every day ne=
ver to take any of what happens for granted.

  Robin,
   
  I very much appreciate your comments and con=
fidence in me, but at the end of the day I'm no different than anyone else.=

  The only thing that may set me apart from some of the other researchers =
here is that I have a bit more experience and 
  being disabled allows me a=
 lot more time for research. I am always willing and hopefully able to help=
 new researchers with 
  my advice and knowledge I have gained through expe=
rience. But my ideology is not the end all explanation or truth of box rese=
arch
  all opinions here are valuable and deserving of consideration and at=
tention.
   
  As for your question, the fact that I am blessed enough to r=
eceive a fairly good level of communication I believe is based once 
  agai=
n on the relationship I have built with my tech/guides and the synchronizat=
ion of energy we have developed.
  The level of communication we are at I b=
elieve is only the very tip of the iceberg. My goal in "MY" research is to =
reach a level of communication that 
  allows us to speak easily and freely=
 with our spirit friends in a fluid and continual fashion as if having a pl=
easant telephone conversation.
   
  The gist of the messages I am receivin=
g now are directed toward our spirit counterparts achieving the same goal. =
It is already a comfort to me to know they are there and I have had the opp=
ortunity to speak with close family members and friends that have crossed o=
ver. And also recently Ms. Sarah Estep who has made the transition and is b=
eginning to work now on the
  spirit side to further the communication. Any=
 information I receive from the spirits I recognise to be friends is invalu=
able. Something as simple as a yes or no answer to a direct question that h=

    It's always refre=

      Robin,
       
      I agree with Ste=
ve on a couple of points. First let me say that I
      do believe that we =
all have a "technician/guide/guardian" call them what you
      may. but I =
usually call them by the names they introduced themselves by.
       
     =
 I know for a fact through many, many, many box sessions that when I turn
 =
     a box on, could be Frank's box or the minibox or the RS 470 does not m=
atter which.
       
      The same two entities will come through immediat=
ely, So much so now, that I do not even ask for conformation that
      it =
is in fact them. I recognise their individual voice patterns. I have built =
a solid relationship with these two spirits
      I know as mike and Lisa s=
o much so that I have even gotten to know their individual personalities.
 =
      
      There are other newer researchers here that will attest to the=
 fact that when they where doing their first sessions
      I had asked my =
two "Friends" Mike and Lisa to assist in getting them started and invariabl=
y the spirits that came 
      through to these new researchers during thei=
r first sessions identified themselves as Mike and Lisa.
       
      Stev=
e says he does not turn on his box and use them as a crutch, that is not en=
tirely true. I had done research 
      very closely with Steve until recen=
tly and I would venture to say that 99% if not every session he starts with=
 "Mike & Lisa
      are you available to talk with me" 
       
      Also =
I don't consider working with my technicians as using them as a crutch, The=
y would not allow that.
      They are not there like butlers at our beckon=
ed call when we feel they may be of some use.
      Quite the opposite, wit=
hout them we would get no communication at all, they are allowing us the ho=
nor of receiving this 
      celestial communication. They are the moderato=
rs, facilitators and generators of all we hear and send to and from the spi=
rit realm.
      And they also stand as guards and protectors to do the bes=
t they can to keep us from being deceived or taken down a dark path.
      =
 
      Some here wait for others to state an opinion and then tend to agre=
e with that opinion no matter what they have experienced to be true.
      =
 
      Robin, my advice to you as a new researcher in this field. Form you=
r own beliefs through your experience and research.
      Listen and learn =
from others but do not let what you believe to be true or not, be swayed by=
 popular opinion.

        Steve,

        I certainly ap=

          If i may add =

      <P>Robin,<BR> <BR>I agree with Steve on a coupl=

usually 
      call them by the names they introduced themselves by.<BR>&nb=

RS 470 does not matter 
      which.<BR> <BR>The same two entities wil=
l come through immediately, 
      So much so now, that I do not even ask f=
or conformation that<BR>it is in 
      fact them. I recognise their indivi=
dual voice patterns. I have built a 
      solid relationship with these tw=
o spirits<BR>I know as mike and Lisa so 
      much so that I have even got=
ten to know their individual 
      personalities.<BR> <BR>There are o=
ther newer researchers here that 
      will attest to the fact that when t=
hey where doing their first 
      sessions<BR>I had asked my two "Friends"=
 Mike and Lisa to assist in 
      getting them started and invariably the =
spirits that came <BR>through to 
      these new researchers during their =
first sessions identified themselves as 
      Mike and Lisa.<BR> <BR>=
Steve says he does not turn on his box and use 
      them as a crutch, tha=
t is not entirely true. I had done research <BR>very 
      closely with St=
eve until recently and I would venture to say that 99% if 
      not every =
session he starts with "Mike & Lisa<BR>are you available to 
      talk=
 with me" <BR> <BR>Also I don't consider working with my 
      techni=
cians as using them as a crutch, They would not allow that.<BR>They 
      =
are not there like butlers at our beckoned call when we feel they may be 
 =
     of some use.<BR>Quite the opposite, without them we would get no 
    =
  communication at all, they are allowing us the honor of receiving this 
 =
     <BR>celestial communication. They are the moderators, facilitators and=
 
      generators of all we hear and send to and from the spirit realm.<BR=
>And 
      they also stand as guards and protectors to do the best they ca=
n to keep 
      us from being deceived or taken down a dark path.<BR> =

      wait for others to state an opinion and then tend to =
agree with that 
      opinion no matter what they have experienced to be

      true.<BR> <BR>Robin, my advice to you as a new researcher in thi=
s 
      field. Form your own beliefs through your experience and 
      re=
search.<BR>Listen and learn from others but do not let what you believe 
  =
    to be true or not, be swayed by popular 
      opinion.<BR> <BR>Br=

        <DIV>I certainly appreciate your thoughts.  In the back =
of my mind 
        is always the question of whether we are being Deceived=
.  Just for 
        the sake of argument, is it POSSIBLE we're being =
manipulated by 
        something evil?  I'm not frightened, and I won=
't stop my own 
        research (the negative stuff just makes me more det=
ermined), but my mind 
        does go there sometimes.  I hope that a=
long with developing my 
        "ear" I can acquire the gift of disce=
rnment.</DIV>
