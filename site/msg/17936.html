<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hmm ... even with the cheapest AM radio with a loopstick antenna, you should
be able to get stations in the daytime a couple hundred miles away unless
you&#x27;re in a metal building. At night you should be able to get AM stations
up to 500-1000 miles away. I&#x27;m listening to WBZ in Boston on 1030 right now
from Illinois. If you&#x27;re not, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s something wrong with your
radio.

&gt; Tks. Zack, I get virtually no AM here, because I am rural, in the woods,
&gt; most people I think are using AM to pick up the voice&#x27;s, I have a large
&gt; antenna on the roof, I have no idea if that has anything to do with it or
&gt; not, and I have satellites for tv, and a wireless Y on the pc, There&#x27;s got
&gt; to be something we not seeing in how they are communicating, they may not
&gt; really be using just a radio signal, but something else over the top of it
&gt; or through? sf

&gt; The range of frequencies generally considered longwave are BELOW the AM
&gt; broadcast band in frequency - in the vicinity of 100 to 400 kHz (or even
&gt; lower). The wavelength of these frequencies ranges from 750 to 3000 meters -
&gt; approximately 0.5 to 1.8 miles. The longwave part of the spectrum is not
&gt; conducive to radio transmissions of wide bandwidth. In Europe there are some
&gt; AM radio stations in the 2000 to 1000 meter range. Very large antennas are
&gt; usually needed. In the USA, there are airport beacons in this frequency
&gt; range which send Morse code identifiers.
&gt;
&gt; FM is in the VHF part of the spectrum. The wavelengths range from 2.8
&gt; to 3.4 meters - about 9.2 to 11.2 feet.

&gt;&gt; Does any one know anything about long wave lengths? And wide band widths?
&gt;&gt; Is FM a long wave?  My RS do not get signal on the AM where I am, and there
&gt;&gt; are limited stations here, actually only one or two radio stations, and they
&gt;&gt; are anywhere from 50 to 60 miles away for the closest very few stations.
&gt;&gt; For the heck of it I asked if they need the long wave, i got a &quot;yes&quot; out of
&gt;&gt; a guy, wish I knew how to make these things. sf

Hmm ... e en wi h he cheapes AM adio wi h a loops ick an enna, you should be able o ge s a ions in he day ime a couple hund ed miles away unless you&#x27; e in a me al building.
