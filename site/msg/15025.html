Sorry, RJ. I stand corrected! Soundwaves are not EM waves because they lack=
 the EM component and are subject to our physical environment. Hence, canno=
t travel at the speed of light.

That being said, the heterodyne theory=
 still stands. LOL

Tell me where the seperation on the spectrum tak=

A mistake that a lot=
 of people make is thinking that there are two different types of energy at=
 work when it comes to sound waves and electromagnetic waves. The only thin=
g that seperates them is frequency and power. Radio waves are radio waves b=
ecause they occupy a certain block of the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound =
waves exist on that same spectrum just farther down with much longer waves.=
 Soundwaves and subsonic waves can penetrate almost anything because of the=
ir wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength the more ways we can shield agai=
nst them.
=A0
Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and telem=
etry transmitting wave but the waves also have a physical effect on our env=
ironment by causing molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A little low=
er than this is IR or infrared it too can cause physical objects to heat up=
 but usually it just causes molecules to rotate in place. All physical thin=
gs give off IR light. Its a way the total system conserves energy by sponta=
neously emitting IR radiation.

Here is some food for thought. I am currently reviewing my aud=
io from our May 30th investigation.
=A0
It was me and another girl teammate=
=A0present in the room. I picked up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice =
recorder that I carry with me. We were standing right next to another digit=
al video recorder that I leave beside my night vision camera. That recorder=
 did not pick up this 3rd voice. I have asked the girl that was with me to =
check her recording to see if she picked it up.
=A0
I have long felt the tr=
ue EVP does not come from sound waves in the environment, or then it wouldn=
't be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are appearing directly on=
 the recordings.
=A0
This instance with the recorders may back that theory =
up. That other recorder should have picked that voice up if it were sound w=
aves in the environment.
=A0
I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The=
=A0file that is named=A0"01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip.=A0You will hear m=
y voice as I say "Yeah", and then another comes in right after that. I thin=
k I know what it says.
=A0
Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still=
 did not hear this until playback. It isn't clear, so I am not as excited a=
bout it as my one's from the last investigation.

I have a ru=
nning theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exac=
tly where they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. =
If you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequency then i=
f you add or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or alternate f=
requency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have=
 an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then y=
ou will have a intermediate difference=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within hum=
an hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electro=
nic equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From th=
is theory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few inches of the =
recorder.
=A0
We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radio with s=
uperheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some passive=
 sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph=
 Pompeii.
