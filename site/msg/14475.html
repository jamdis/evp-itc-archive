&gt; Manipulating EMF is one thing.  But directly storing bits on a media is way
&gt; beyond that.  Bits are not stored in a continuous stream.  They are broken
&gt; into bytes (little packets) that is totally controlled by the processor and
&gt; software.  For Elvis to &quot;encode directly&quot; to the media, he would have to do
&gt; what that software does to the digital signals coming in from the AtoD
&gt; converter: he would have to group the bits into (for example) 16 little
&gt; herds each, decide on the specific bit interpretation scheme (2&#x27;s
&gt; complement?),  find space on the media, update the media&#x27;s dictionary of
&gt; where there is free space and where there isn&#x27;t, link the herds together
&gt; with some sort of linked pointer, skip around the areas marked &#x27;bad&#x27; on the
&gt; media, update things like date/time modified and size, respect any kind of
&gt; ownership permissions on the media, and so on.
&gt;
&gt; It is much more credible for the signal to be manipulated near the AtoD
&gt; converter (where EMF changes would have the most straighforward result) than
&gt; in the digital media itself.

&gt; &quot;Probably not &quot;directly&quot;, since that would mean grandma would have to have

&gt;
&gt; Not necessarily- maybe it is that just by trying to communicate through our
&gt; equipment, it happens automatically. They don&#x27;t have to realize that they
&gt; are manipulating the EMF to make it occur, it just happens. It&#x27;s the nature
&gt; of being of pure energy.

&gt; Probably not &quot;directly&quot;, since that would mean grandma would have to have
&gt; quite an understanding of digital encoding, including which bits mean what,
&gt; when, and where.  But even on a digital recorder, there is still an analog
&gt; element (the Analog to Digital converter) which takes the sound pressure
&gt; waves, as represented by some analog electronic detection element, and
&gt; converts that into digital.  That way, long departed uncle Ebenezer does not
&gt; need to do anything digital.  Under this scenario, if sound is not being
&gt; heard in the room, but is being induced into the circuitry, then it would be
&gt; round about that AtoD converter (assuming it isn&#x27;t other just plain old
&gt; noise in the digital elements).
&gt;
&gt; Someone with more electronic know-how than me might be able to better
&gt; pinpoint the area in the analog portion of that AtoD pipeline where it would
&gt; be most likely it could be influenced by, say, an EM field, and that would
&gt; also occur in a normal analog tape recorder.

&gt;   This is what I think true EVP is Eric. Not and actual sound emitting a
&gt; sound wave in the environment, but EMF manipulation in order to imprint the
&gt; message directly to the recording media. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it is analog
&gt; or digital.
&gt;
&gt; If the sound that is recorded emitted a sound wave in the physical
&gt; environment, then it is really a disembodied voice, and not true EVP.

&gt;  Actually that I would buy into  But the question I have when you say
&gt; &quot;tape&quot; are you talking old analog tape or digi recording.  Here is the
&gt; reason I believe it can be do &quot;real-time&quot;.  As you all know we use
&gt; electromagnetic Field detectors in field investigations.  If a spirit can
&gt; manipulate that with to show that they are there by giving off a EM field
&gt; whose to say they can&#x27;t manipulate a magnetic strip of a tape or even the
&gt; electronics in a Digi recorder to speak in &quot;real-time&quot;.

&gt;&gt;  Okay I have another one for you to think about.. I tape a session and
&gt;&gt; review it later..  even a day later.  Upon review the message that comes
&gt;&gt; over is about something that ‘just happened’ while I was reviewing or
&gt;&gt; happened after taping?  Is it possible that spirit can manipulate the
&gt;&gt; recording AFTER recording has stopped or even manipulate the audio while
&gt;&gt; reviewing?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; An give you an example of this I was recording one day and I reviewed the
&gt;&gt; audio the next day.  While reviewing – about half way through – the message
&gt;&gt; “Your mother is calling” was found.  I saved it and moved on and within two
&gt;&gt; seconds my mom called.  You say it is a coincidence except that I hadn’t
&gt;&gt; spoken to my mother in over a year.  During this same conversation with her
&gt;&gt; – we sorta made amends and I told her the story of the ‘secret’ I had found
&gt;&gt; out about a family member having a child out of wedlock in the late 1920s.
&gt;&gt; Quick backstory.. I found out about this out-of-wedlock birth through my
&gt;&gt; genealogy research and contacted spirit through the box and I was promptly
&gt;&gt; told to keep it secret and which I promised to do…
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Well in this conversation with my mom after not speaking for a year I told
&gt;&gt; her what I had found out.  When the telephone conversation ended with my
&gt;&gt; mom… I was amazed that the recording had told me she would call right be
&gt;&gt; fore she did – even though the audio was recorded the previous day.  I
&gt;&gt; proceeded to go back to reviewing the audio and the very first thing I heard
&gt;&gt; was:  THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SECRET – YOU LIED.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Maybe they can manipulate ‘real-time’ literally??? ?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  2 different things happening-that&#x27; s why. When you get EVP that everyone
&gt;&gt; understands,  it is outward, in the environment. Not a communication through
&gt;&gt; subconscious means.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; EVP that people swear they hear, but noone else can make sense, may be a
&gt;&gt; message to them via subconscious means. That isn&#x27;t to say that ALL EVP&#x27;s
&gt;&gt; like this are true messages, I am sure alot are just matrixing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But then that is how the art of scrying starts-matrixing. Like the
&gt;&gt; Rorschach tests. The images you matrix with those gives the psychologist an
&gt;&gt; insight into your mind.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; By gazing into a dark, reflective surface, you start to see cloudy images.
&gt;&gt; At first, you will just be matrixing faces in the clouds and not getting
&gt;&gt; much substance. Try it, you will see what I am saying. With practice, you
&gt;&gt; start to see clear, concise images.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I think that is what happening with audio as well.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We already know for a fact pareidolia can occur in audio as well as visual
&gt;&gt; stimulus.

&gt;&gt; yes I understand its personal to that particular individual but why can&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; I hear it.  I have gotten some very personal EVPs through the traditional
&gt;&gt; investigation way (not through a box or anything of that matter) that all
&gt;&gt; others have heard.

&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know for sure about that one either, but I am not ready to

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What makes it a possibility to me is that so many people are hearing

&gt;&gt; I think that is the problem I am having though Jim.  When you say &quot;work
&gt;&gt; them over till you hear them&quot;  to me I should not have to work them over
&gt;&gt; till I hear them.  Yes taking out the ambient and background noise is one
&gt;&gt; thing.  But if you just keep on listening to them with different
&gt;&gt; enhancements you are bound to hear something (matrixing).  If one person is
&gt;&gt; not meant to hear it they won&#x27;t hear it (I guess I am not quite ready to
&gt;&gt; believe that one right yet).  I think you all know what I am getting at.
