It should be much more than simple one \nworders, and if \n&gt; the box is functioning/used correctly, the mesaages should be \nwhole \n&gt; sentences. Granted that there is a learning period of how to \nlisten/hear.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m gettign stuff about the world wide meditation on the 17th of \nthis month, \n&gt; they are saying that it &quot;heals it&quot;, and that it &quot;stops the \nmountain&quot;, the \n&gt; mountain being the humungus asteroid that hits the planet in 2012. \nThese \n&gt; statements are very mixed in with the box audio, and if no one \nhears the \n&gt; stuff that&#39;s pretty much in the clear, the chance of anyone \nhearing this \n&gt; stuff is zero.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; http://newlivehotmail.com\n&gt;"}
