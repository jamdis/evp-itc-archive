I&#39;m so used to doing thorough searches on Internet for data \nbefore I buy it that I almost never have to buy any sort of data sheets or \ninstruction books anymore. I did have to buy a manual on how to CLA \n(clean, lubricate and adjust) a Rapax large-format camera shutter because \nthe full info wasn&#39;t available on-line.\n\nBut a lot of people aren&#39;t used to such searches and probably would just \npay out the money.  And look at the spammers.  If someone weren&#39;t falling \nfor their garbage they would all just dry up and blow away. There must be \nat least a few dumb people out there.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Fri, 21 Nov 2008, M.A. Coletta (Mike) wrote:\n\n&gt; It was brought to my attention that a guy named Dave Oester is selling\n&gt; an ebook on how to modify the Radio Shack 12-469, something he calls\n&gt; the &#39;Digcom&#39;.
