<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Uhhhm, I really want one, lol. All kidding aside, I do want a puck
pretty bad. For ITC work, it has a much larger vocabulary, and you can
have it save and write a log file for later review. And as always, you
can use a prg. such as Audacity to capture the session in real time.
Another huge plus about the puck is that there are I believe 9 sensors
for emf and temperature, and it has datalogging ability. That makes it
worth it right there, kindof a swiss-army knife of paranormal
instrumentation. Also if I am looking at the device right, it looks
like there is an expansion port for future upgradeability. I would
love to be able to purchase one of Bill&#x27;s &quot;research units&quot; which as I
understand it, is a puck with more sensors and goodies.

One benefit to the ovilus is that it is handheld, but the handicaps
outweigh that benefit if you are looking for better vocabulary, emf
readings, and logfile records. I hear the next version of the ovilus
will have some of those features. I really cannot wait to get my hands
on this technology, and even moreso now after reviewing the files of
group members here who have used these devices.

thanks, 
Andy
