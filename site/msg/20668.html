&gt; Most people I know are in a group are not in it to be scared..Like you Adriana they looking for proof of some kind..I&#x27;m a founder of a group..but I don&#x27;t go ghost hunting..lol I don&#x27;t have to,  I understand that some people are still looking for personal reasons or just being curious...I don&#x27;t have my group paying for places we go..unless its like a very hot spot such as Mansfield which we are going in April but most places we go we are invited free of charge..we were just at a &quot;haunted hotel&quot; for free.

&gt; I never wanted to be scared. That was never my intention when I joined a ghosthunting group. I just wanted to make contact with something other than physical human. And I definitely got to, even felt what was apparently a ghost (the tingling feeling in the air). And I was happy, and it felt peaceful. I think I&#x27;d be equally happy to meet a space alien coming out of a spaceship. As long as they didn&#x27;t laser beam me when I go to hug them. :)

&gt; &gt; Agreed. I was introduced to the ghost box at a paranormal group meeting, but ever since then the vast majority of my sessions have been at home. I went to a few cemeteries at midnight at first, but that quickly wore off when I realized that I get equal, and even better, communication, just sitting at the dining room table.

&gt; &gt; &gt; My approach to EVP and ITC is for spirit communcation not associated with supposed hauntings. That&#x27;s why I find it frustrating that most insist on running aorund in the dark to get evidence and EVP when they could stay home and get much more. Spirits and entities travel, even the ones that are supposedly stuck will come to you if asked. I don&#x27;t like the Halloween, and fear crap. I think most just want to be frightened, so they pay gigabucks to go the haunted hot spots hoping beyond hope to get scared out their wits by imaginary demons.
