I suppose one route is to, as you suggest, just walk away fr=\r\nom all this.  I guess you have to look at the big picture and decide if it&#39;=\r\ns worth the frustration, the stress, and the angst, especially what it does=\r\n to your health.  Nothing is worth throwing your health away over.  \n\n     =\r\n           Even dropping all this, just for a while, might also tell you if=\r\n any health problems you are experiencing might be being aggravated by all =\r\nthe drama.  And it might have the side effect of letting all the negativity=\r\n and egos out there burn themselves out, so if you do look back into things=\r\n a while down the road, it could be a prettier picture then.\n\n             =\r\n   Other than a full retreat, I don&#39;t think anything else would make a diff=\r\nerence other than a full attack: creating, for  instance, good objective st=\r\nandards for evaluation and test of the technology and results, which the sh=\r\nows and &#39;experts&#39; seem to find anathema.  Then, if their claims were to be =\r\nconfronted by such standards, they&#39;d find themselves unable to stand up to =\r\nthem, and eventually, hopefully, be embarrassed back into obscurity.\n\n\n\n\n  =\r\n              --- On Mon, 4/6/09, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                  From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...=\r\nm&gt;\n                  Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Is pride so wrong!?\n       =\r\n           To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n                  Date: Monday, Apri=\r\nl 6, 2009, 2:40 PM\n\n\n\n                   Yeah, it&#39;s for that reason that it=\r\n&#39;s very tempting to walk away from all things paranormal.

Most people watch these shows for the escape and enterta=\r\ninment value, like the rest of tv.

You seem to have put=\r\n alot of thought and time into that. \n\n                             What re=\r\nally bothers me is the self proclaimed experts out there that take all evid=\r\nence and experience and try to make it negative, and evil. Maybe many get t=\r\nired, or even affraid of seeking paranormal experience for that reason.\n\n  =\r\n                           I don&#39;t do ghost hunts or invesitgations, but th=\r\ne hauntings I&#39;ve heard of seem to be nothing more than something trying to =\r\nget someone&#39;s attention. It&#39;s these experts that turn it into something tha=\r\nt must be negative.  There&#39;s Hollywood, such as the &quot;Haunting In CT&quot;, these=\r\n same experts will proclaim is based on fact, when the facts are probably n=\r\nothing more than your creaking floors, just to make the whole paranoramal f=\r\nield dark and demon filled. In my case, fear does not sell, I won&#39; watch th=\r\nose movies. \n\n                             I think there is good EVP eviden=\r\nce, and I&#39;ve heard many from various researchers.

Too bad the interest in EVP=\r\n doesn&#39;t pick up while that ghost hunting mentality drops off. I keep sayin=\r\ng, you&#39;ll get better, more consistent, and more meaningful messages if you =\r\nrecord at home. The ghosts, spirits and entities can and do travel. You als=\r\no have to listen to the recordings more than once. \n                       =\r\n       &gt; \n                              &gt; Frank\n\n                          =\r\n    That is an interesting observation. I think the core of the issue is th=\r\nat there seems to be a `sweet spot&#39; in paranormal beliefs where there is ju=\r\nst enough science, just enough technical backing, just enough paranormal cl=\r\naims, and just enough indefinite evidence that keeps people interested in t=\r\nhe ghost hunting mentality\n\n                              Evidence which be=\r\ncomes too indefinite turns off most people. As they become more aware of se=\r\nnsitives who simply make claims (&quot;I feel there is a GHOST here!&quot;), but prov=\r\nide no evidence other than statements, people eventually get bored. Similar=\r\nly, people eventually grow tired of the anthropomorphism of every little oc=\r\ncurrence in a house: a creak implies a footstep, which implies a person, wh=\r\nich, if not seen, implies a ghost. But a creak does not equal a footstep.\n\n=\r\n                              And while this kind of indefinite evidence ca=\r\nn lose an audience, so can evidence that is claimed to be &quot;obviously&quot; evide=\r\nnt by technology. Here, the investigator is no longer making vague claims, =\r\nbut waving science around, like FLIR cameras, or EMF meters, and then makin=\r\ng proclamations of the results. But again, people eventually see these are =\r\njust lights and sounds from electronics, and investigators making more clai=\r\nms. It&#39;s like the psychics again, but with visual aids.\n\n                  =\r\n            I think the reason EVP studies are not securing more interest, =\r\nas you noted, are a little of both effects. First is the anthropomorphism p=\r\nroblem: I notice many EVP experimenters proclaim what their results sound l=\r\nike, or name the sound file by what they&#39;ve heard. But like the creaks, &quot;so=\r\nunds like&quot; does not equal &quot;is&quot;. This is then compounded by the technology b=\r\nacking: regardless of how valid the EVP researcher&#39;s results are, the techn=\r\nology can seem intimidating, but the researchers often proclaim the obvious=\r\nness of their results. People again become turned off by it because it is n=\r\not obvious to them, and in the end it is just another piece of technology p=\r\nresenting sounds, with no obvious connection to the paranormal, except by t=\r\nhe claims and interpretations of the presenters.\n\n                         =\r\n     I believe, taking these issues into account, there is a way for EVP st=\r\nudies to garner more interest. For now, the analysis coming from the resear=\r\nchers usually seems like a claim, and it is these claims, imho, that is bei=\r\nng classified by the public with the rest of the paranormal claims, and so,=\r\n it also becomes less of an interest. A new approach could be one without t=\r\nhe claims and interpretations of the investigators, one where the sounds ar=\r\ne simply played and not labeled. The interpretation of the data could be le=\r\nft to the listeners. Web sites which present EVPs could be developed where =\r\npeople could not see others interpretations until they entered their own. I=\r\n think this would be such a novel approach, that it would give the public a=\r\n better feeling of true involvement in the research, and feel less like the=\r\ny are simply being exposed to the claims of others. And I think that feelin=\r\ng of involvement is what is needed to reignited the public interest here.\n\n=\r\n\n\n                         \n\n\n\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_016E_01C9B77F.A097EAD0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18702&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;Ok-so it looks like I am the one following \nyou.

To=\r\no bad \n                              the interest in EVP doesn&#39;t pick up wh=\r\nile that \n                              ghost hunting mentality drops off. =\r\nI keep saying, \n                              you&#39;ll get better, more consi=\r\nstent, and more \n                              meaningful messages if you r=\r\necord at home. The \n                              ghosts, spirits and entit=\r\nies can and do travel. \n                              You also have to list=\r\nen to the recordings more \n                              than once. &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Frank&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That is \n                              an interesti=\r\nng observation. I think the core of \n                              the issu=\r\ne is that there seems to be a `sweet spot&#39; \n                              i=\r\nn paranormal beliefs where there is just enough \n                          =\r\n    science, just enough technical backing, just \n                         =\r\n     enough paranormal claims, and just enough \n                           =\r\n   indefinite evidence that keeps people interested \n                      =\r\n        in the ghost hunting mentality&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Evidence \n                   =\r\n           which becomes too indefinite turns off most \n                   =\r\n           people. As they become more aware of sensitives \n               =\r\n               who simply make claims (&quot;I feel there is a GHOST \n          =\r\n                    here!&quot;), but provide no evidence other than \n          =\r\n                    statements, people eventually get bored. \n             =\r\n                 Similarly, people eventually grow tired of the \n          =\r\n                    anthropomorphism of every little occurrence in a \n     =\r\n                         house: a creak implies a footstep, which implies a=\r\n \n                              person, which, if not seen, implies a ghost=\r\n. But a \n                              creak does not equal a footstep.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;And while \n                              this kind of indefinite eviden=\r\nce can lose an \n                              audience, so can evidence tha=\r\nt is claimed to be \n                              &quot;obviously&quot; evident by te=\r\nchnology. Here, the \n                              investigator is no longe=\r\nr making vague claims, but \n                              waving science ar=\r\nound, like FLIR cameras, or EMF \n                              meters, and =\r\nthen making proclamations of the \n                              results. Bu=\r\nt again, people eventually see these \n                              are jus=\r\nt lights and sounds from electronics, and \n                              in=\r\nvestigators making more claims. It&#39;s like the \n                            =\r\n  psychics again, but with visual aids.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I \n                         =\r\n     think the reason EVP studies are not securing more \n                  =\r\n            interest, as you noted, are a little of both \n                 =\r\n             effects. First is the anthropomorphism problem: I \n           =\r\n                   notice many EVP experimenters proclaim what their \n     =\r\n                         results sound like, or name the sound file by what=\r\n \n                              they&#39;ve heard. But like the creaks, &quot;sounds=\r\n like&quot; \n                              does not equal &quot;is&quot;. This is then com=\r\npounded by \n                              the technology backing: regardles=\r\ns of how valid \n                              the EVP researcher&#39;s results =\r\nare, the technology \n                              can seem intimidating, b=\r\nut the researchers often \n                              proclaim the obviou=\r\nsness of their results. People \n                              again become =\r\nturned off by it because it is not \n                              obvious t=\r\no them, and in the end it is just another \n                              pi=\r\nece of technology presenting sounds, with no \n                             =\r\n obvious connection to the paranormal, except by \n                         =\r\n     the claims and interpretations of the \n                              p=\r\nresenters.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I believe, taking these issues \n                         =\r\n     into account, there is a way for EVP studies to \n                     =\r\n         garner more interest. For now, the analysis coming \n              =\r\n                from the researchers usually seems like a claim, \n         =\r\n                     and it is these claims, imho, that is being \n         =\r\n                     classified by the public with the rest of the \n       =\r\n                       paranormal claims, and so, it also becomes less of \n=\r\n                              an interest. A new approach could be one with=\r\nout \n                              the claims and interpretations of the \n =\r\n                             investigators, one where the sounds are simply=\r\n \n                              played and not labeled. The interpretation =\r\nof the \n                              data could be left to the listeners. =\r\nWeb sites \n                              which present EVPs could be develo=\r\nped where people \n                              could not see others interp=\r\nretations until they \n                              entered their own. I th=\r\nink this would be such a \n                              novel approach, tha=\r\nt it would give the public a \n                              better feeling =\r\nof true involvement in the \n                              research, and fee=\r\nl less like they are simply being \n                              exposed to=\r\n the claims of others. And I think that \n                              feel=\r\ning of involvement is what is needed to \n                              reig=\r\nnited the public interest \n                              here.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n                              &lt;DIV \n                            style=\r\n=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n             =\r\n       &lt;DIV \n                  style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABL=\r\nE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n        &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n        &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n =\r\n       &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n        &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot; \n =\r\n     width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n      &lt;P&gt;&lt;=\r\n/P&gt;\n      &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n      &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n    &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n=\r\n    &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot; \n  width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End group email --=\r\n&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_016E_01C9B77F.A097EAD0--"}
