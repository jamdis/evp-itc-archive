<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce H. and everyone,

 Thanks again for the comments on my files I appreciate them. Bruce 
thanks for the criticism and advice on doing them better. I do tend 
to over kill my files with alot of noise reduction and filtering. The 
reason they don&#x27;t sound like RS box files is that I weed out just the 
voice I hear without all of the background clutter. Most of the time. 
Another thing is that my hearing is acute in the low frequency range. 
I have hearing loss in the high upper frequencies. That&#x27;s why I can 
hear what others tend not to hear. Also I find that when you listen 
to these with different types of speaker systems and different 
formats like MP3&#x27;s and Wav files and Aiff files and Ogg files they 
sound completely different. I have also found that using different 
headphones can effect the sounds too in the way you hear them. Bruce 
some of your files I hear something all together different then what 
you say they said ,but that could be my hearing is different than 
yours and my sound system may be different than yours. I&#x27;m not sure. 
That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a difficult thing to interpret these sound files 
sometimes. You have some I can really hear what you said they were 
saying and others not. Your right in the fact that I do tend to take 
too much away from the file with noice reduction and I&#x27;ll have to cut 
back on that ,and to copy more of the background noise so everyone 
knows it&#x27;s from the RS 12-469 model. Bruce I appreciate your advice 
alot. keep me informed on anything I&#x27;m doing wrong with these boxes 
since I am new to this and you pretty much know more about them than 
I do. Since I have mostly worked with Tradional EVP&#x27;s and this is a 
completely different kind of venue to work with and research I hope 
you all will help me out and point me in the right direction.  The 
thing is I hear these files as clear as anything. Maybe I&#x27;m just 
matrixing what I hear on the boxes I don&#x27;t know. All I know is that 
what I have on here all came from the RS 12-469 Box and I have alot 
to learn from the group on recording them and so forth. I want to 
thank everyone with their comments and for their help in this 
research here with EVP-ITC it&#x27;s very interesting to say the least. I 
hope you all are doing okay and I hope that my files get better and 
more understandable as I do my research in this study with all of 
you. Thanks again !!!!!

Regards,

Ralph the Ghost Hunter

I forgot I wanted to ask you Bruce and anyone else on here what is 
the Scan rate on your boxes ? On my RS 12-469 it&#x27;s 17 seconds to make 
a complete linear scan. On the RS 12-470 it&#x27;s 11 seconds. On the RS 
20-125 it&#x27;s 11 seconds too. What should the Scan rate be ? Just 
wondering if other people have different scan rates than mine. Does 
that make a diffence in getting better quality voices ? Thanks.</pre>
