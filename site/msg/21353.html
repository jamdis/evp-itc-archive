<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Predictions from Box is really what drew me in to this particular method of ITC. A Franks Box built in March 2007 predicted a very specific military stike. I was hesitant to post the information at the time since it seemed inflammatory but was shocked to see most of it come true. Here&#x27;s the link to what happened and what Franks Box predicted to a large extent.

I told Frank about this and then dialog with him about other forecast led to a interview with George Noorey about Doomsday Predictions. After the interview it was stated by a listener that people will look for events that fits the prediction and Box forecast were unreliable. The forecast that we spoke about concerned a catastrophe on the East Coast of the United States that may result in loss of life in a tidal wave from the Atlantic ocean and possibly due to a meteor strike. However, with no meteors being tracked and no huge storm in weather forecast bearing down on the easy coast, it was a dicey prediction as it was August 14 and the prediction said the danger would be on the 15th but no year was given. Here&#x27;s the link to that broadcast:

At that point Frank and I knew at least we went public with information regarding a disaster and we provided specific information. Then that next day, August 15, a sudden storm developed into Tropical Depression Bill, intensified to Tropical Storm Bill, and formed a large eye. Within days, a newly dubbed Hurricane Bill would end the life of a 7-year-old girl who drowned after she, her father, and a 12-year-old girl were swept off a rocky ledge near Acadia National Park in Maine. Here&#x27;s the link to info on that storm:

&gt; &gt;Also wanted to add, after the Japan earthquake happened, two people on my Facebook admitted they had been having &quot;wall of water&quot; and earthquake dreams.  You never know whose predictions are accurate and whose aren&#x27;t and when, but when you get several people coming together predicting similar things that should be a warning... the psychic prediction registry website makes that possible.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Since predictions seem to be popular on these boards I thought I&#x27;d post this

&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; I found this video posted on www.prophecies.us
&gt; &gt;&gt; Regular Joes and Janes post their  predictions there.  I&#x27;ve followed this site a year and a half now, and they&#x27;ve had some predictions that came true.  If you&#x27;re into predictions, I highly recommend this site.
