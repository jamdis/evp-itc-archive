I know it gets frustrating, but that is what keeps up going!  You will get past the week signal and when you get that 1 awesome session (above all the rest) it will be well worth it.  \n   \n   \n  I thought the very same thing when I started.  I couldn&#39;t get enough of the voices, and keep wanting more and more, only not to be able to get the stations and scanning I needed.  I ended up researching for signal strenght, asking Frank and the others for help, and hear I am now.  \n   \n  Its the hurdles we climb, but once we make it to the top......WHOOO what sweet success!\n   \n  Juli\n  \n\nRon Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n          Just found this about your new box.  Looks and sounds promising.  But I suppose in my Land-of-Weak-Signals I would get nothing.  On the other hand, I almost feel I would sacrafice a volume of sessions and signals for good, clear, multi-word messages.  I am getting EVP block because I am afraid I will get nothing during a session or, worse yet, I may be getting messages but I cannot hear or understand them...if you get my drift.  Good stuff at your end.  Ron L\n\nLC Duplatt &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:       I had posted this elsewhere, but thought I should post it here for \ngroup fodder.
