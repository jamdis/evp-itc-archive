<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree and i&#x27;m sorry to all involved.  This was very inappropriate 
here on my part and i apologize.  Let&#x27;s continue with our findings.  
No more dumb bickering, just evidence of our of different ideas. 
This board is important to me and i&#x27;ll continue only business from 
here on out.

&gt; Nicely said. I am new to this group as well as to this type 
research so I have been just sitting back and reading so that I 
might better understand the whole area of EVP. Quite 
truthfully......the squabbling is juvenile and worthless and a big 
turn off. Those who are arguing and power playing.... shut up (AT 
LEAST ON THIS SITE) or get out because your personal attitudes 
towards each other can carry on some where else on your own time. 
Please evaluate your your true motives for being involved in a feild 
we are barely touching the surface of. Time can be spent much 
better...dont you think.

&gt; 
&gt; Just a note to remind everyone we arent here to argue we are here 
to research together. So if you have negative remarks to make to 
each other or discussions which should be done in private take them 
off this group to private emails. We dont need the negativity here 
it interferes with the work we are trying to do and wont be 
tolerated.
&gt; 
&gt; Nobody is better than anyone else or less worthy for contact than 
anyone else.
