&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone here and in the Grass Harp knows your work. Bruce has 
either  
&gt; been banned, left, or caused trouble with his raging ego in 
virtually  
&gt; every group he has belonged to, claims of discoveries, being an  
&gt; &quot;expert&quot;, and well, you name it. He&#x27;s new to EVP research, edits 
his  
&gt; recordings, and us old timers who have recorded for years know he  
&gt; hasn&#x27;t been round that long.
&gt; 
&gt; He&#x27;s made a terrible reputation for himself in this line of 
research.  
&gt; He&#x27;s his biggest fan. We all know your work and what you&#x27;ve done. 
No  
&gt; worries.
&gt; 
&gt; Ignoring Bruce is the best avenue, and be sure to continue to take  
&gt; credit for your work. I&#x27;d make sure to keep  copies of those posts 
of  
&gt; Bruce&#x27;s for your own records and in case Bruce tries anything 
unusual.  
&gt; Also save his emails. It&#x27;s all evidence, not that you&#x27;d need it, 
but  
&gt; as proof.

&gt; &gt; Greetings fellow researchers,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I normally don&#x27;t get into petty matters such as the following, 
but an
&gt; &gt; individual (Bruce Halliday) who was banned from this forum is 
asking
&gt; &gt; me to stop my claim of being the originator of the hack of the 12-
470.
&gt; &gt; He wants me to remove that claim from my website, etc.
&gt; &gt; Bruce&#x27;s e-mail to me was one of surprise.
&gt; &gt; Why... it was on this very forum that Bruce admitted that his
&gt; &gt; attempted hack of the 12-470 did not work, after I had shared my
&gt; &gt; success with all of you.
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve included the forum messages from last year with their date 
and
&gt; &gt; time stamps. The messages are still right here on this forum.
&gt; &gt; Bruce says he hacked the radio first and then posted his hack on 
his
&gt; &gt; website.
&gt; &gt; But, as you can see in the following messages, Bruce told me his
&gt; &gt; attempt did not work, posting this after my hack.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would not even mention this if Bruce&#x27;s e-mail to me wasn&#x27;t so
&gt; &gt; threatening... I just wanted to get the record straight.
&gt; &gt;
