So I don&#39;t know w=\r\nhat\n  &gt; these people are talking about, that you can&#39;t hit the ground runni=\r\nng. \n  &gt; I&#39;ve read about lots of folks doing just that.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; I was k=\r\nind of thinking that shorter was better, too, but I wanted to\n  &gt; make sure=\r\n, because if I was wrong, maybe letting it run a long time\n  &gt; might get ev=\r\nen better responses...but yeah, I think they get tired, as\n  &gt; it probably =\r\ntakes a lot of effort to form those words.\n  &gt; &gt;\n  &gt; &gt; I was also thinking =\r\nall those skeptics who say the boxes don&#39;t work\n  &gt; are probably not treati=\r\nng their sessions like EVP -- I can never hear\n  &gt; much of anything during =\r\nthe session, only afterward when I listen back\n  &gt; and at very high volume.=\r\n At least for me, most of the bulk of the\n  &gt; communication is very, very q=\r\nuiet and located in between the louder\n  &gt; snippets of strong-signaled radi=\r\no announcer voices.
