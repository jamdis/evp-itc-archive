<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>HI Amy,
I dont really think I am &#x27;ghost hunting&#x27;, but more just trying to find
answers.
all we know is something goes on here, and we&#x27;d like to know who, what, why
type thing.
I was impressed with ghost hunters show because of their communication
proof.
that got me to thinking maybe we can find out something here.
its just really odd, because sometimes its very quite for 6 months.. no
voices, no activity, and then boom, it will be active all day long, several
days in a row, etc.
we never know.
we just dont get scared anymore like we use to.
this house sat empty for many months, they had trouble renting it.
we come along, and the first 2-3 years I wanted to move....but we stuck it
out.
I once lived in a very evil house... for some reason I get &#x27;feelings&#x27; about
places and things.. and that house ..it had a feeling of evil , we had to
find someone who could help us. and then we moved as fast as we could.
I saw the movie white noise. but I dont undertsand it.  so have tried a
voice activated recorder. have been told it will pick up voices in the
house.
but not yet. but everything is so random here..I guess it could take us
awhile.
so I&#x27;m here just reading and learning.
Lyn.

&gt; ive been out on hunts, the best advice i can give is this, shut down
everything in your house, the heat/air etc tv&#x27;s. At night whenits quiet sit
in a room and introduce yourself, and if theres anyone here that would like
to communicate. Can as them to make a noise or stop a clock, grandfather
type work best, have seen one stopped by a grandmother &quot;residing&quot; in her
sons house. The work that you will see mostly on this evp group is done at
home and not for &quot;ghost hunting&quot; per say, rather making contact with those
on the other side that are able to make contact. We have people here that
are in constant contact with &quot;groups&quot; on the other side and relatives. Frank
receives communications about events people etc as well. This is a rather
broad mineded group and very evp smart.
&gt; if you need anything else or advice you can always catch me on yahoo
messenger too.
