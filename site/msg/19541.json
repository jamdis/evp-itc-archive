We have a\nTV show that plays throughout Central NY (accessible to o=\r\nver 1.5\nmillion viewers total) called CNY Spirits.\n\nIn this episode, which =\r\nhas been uploaded to youtube, you can see the\nMinibox Plus on an investigat=\r\nion. It was used in tandem with a poker\ngame and garnered some amazing resu=\r\nlts. The Minibox was used in part\n2, and everyones favorite shack hack was =\r\nused in part 3. To my\nknowledge, this is the first time a Minibox has been =\r\nused on\ntelevision. You will have to ignore what Stacey says about the\nMini=\r\nbox because she was dead wrong on most of her facts. I wish that\nthe produc=\r\ner had interviewed me so I could have explained it a helluva\nlot better.\n\nI=\r\nf you are wondering, I am the goofy looking guy with the pony tail and tatt=\r\noos.\n\nYou can check out pt 1 here:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Danxfj8=\r\nDlrus&feature=3Drelated\n\nThis episode was a followup investigation to a pri=\r\nor one done about 6\nweeks earlier. This earlier investigation yielded some =\r\namazing EVP&#39;s\nand flashlight responses. YOu can view pt 1 here:\n\nhttp://www=\r\n.youtube.com/watch?v=3DEy6uHks4aj4&feature=3Drelated\n\nThese are some of the=\r\n clips from that session.\n\nThe clip about &quot;pissing me off&quot; has become prett=\r\ny famous because\nStacey uses it when she lectures at conferences. It is ver=\r\ny\nintriguing because it is her voice coming through the Hack while she\nis s=\r\nitting at the table. I have discussed this clip with a few of\nyou, and here=\r\n it is a lot cleaner than in the video.\n\nThe rest of the clips are from the=\r\n poker session that were not in the\nvideo. On the &quot;Holding a Five&quot; clip, Mi=\r\nke actually had a pair of\nfives in his hand.\n\nTim\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1501193402-1292551041=:82110\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D4&gt;I&#39;m so glad I have that hack b=\r\nack..its one if everything fails you can pull him out :)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- =\r\nOn &lt;B&gt;Thu, 12/16/10, Tim Woolworth &lt;I&gt;&lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;=\r\n wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid; PAD=\r\nDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@g=\r\nmail.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Ghost Boxes in Action [3 Attachments]&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;To: RTSC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Cc: inside_the_box_rt=\r\nsc_ghost_box_research@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Thursday, December 16, 2010,=\r\n 6:15 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1940802147&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1940802147ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Hi guys.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As some o=\r\nf you know, I work with the inimitable Stacey Jones in a&lt;BR&gt;ghost hunting g=\r\nroup called Central New York Ghost Hunters.
