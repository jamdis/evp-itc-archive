I have 2 of them\n&gt; &gt; and tried over the weekend to utilize them in an investigation. The\n&gt; &gt; exposure time on these things is like 30 seconds. It&#39;s such a pain in\n&gt; &gt; the butt. If you do use the 35mm, what kind of settings do you use?\n&gt; &gt; Any advice? I am totally new to night photography. Has everyone gone\n&gt; &gt; to digital now or what?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Chad\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\nI use a digital SLR (Cannon Digital Rebel xti) with a big flash\nmounted on it either directed up at the ceiling or with a diffuser\nattached to avoid dust orbs. Occasionally I also will set it for a\nlong exposure to capture some cool architecture or something, but I\nwon&#39;t use any of those photos as evidence just because there are so\nmany normal things that can happen during a long exposure to make\nsomething odd show up in the pic. \nIn most situations with the right lens (I love my Canon 50mm f1.8) you\ncan adjust the iso and f-stop to take a good picture in low light with\na fast shutter speed without needing the flash. If you don&#39;t\nunderstand how all the settings (f-stop, iso speed, shutter speed)\nwork together I&#39;d suggest getting yourself a basic photography book or\ntaking a class at your local camera shop. You&#39;d be amazed how many\n&quot;ghost pictures&quot; will start just looking like camera operator error to\nyou after a while. haha\n\n~Elabeth"}
