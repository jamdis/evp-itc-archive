&gt; Hi Debbie,
&gt; 
&gt; Congratulations! Can you re-send that link? I would  like to get 
the time
&gt; and dates your show will air on Maury?
&gt; 
&gt; I missed that.
&gt; 
&gt; I am proud of you and the accomplishments your group has done to 
start
&gt; opening the minds to so many skeptics. Bravo Lady!!
&gt; 
&gt; Blessings,
&gt; 
&gt; Laura

&gt; Hi Misty .. on the link below you can click on &quot;Where to watch&quot; and 
&gt; it will tell you when it will air in your area. 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Ann .. I&#x27;ve never seen the whole show online .. We all sat in a 
&gt; circle (Me, Jeffrey Wands, my Team, and the Producers) .. We asked 
&gt; questions and recorded in complete silence and also as Jeffrey was 
&gt; speaking and so much of what Jeffrey said was validated in the Evp 
&gt; recordings. We had over fifty Evp&#x27;s. The exciting part is that 
Maury 
&gt; doesn&#x27;t sound skeptical anymore .. 
&gt; 
&gt; Just a small part of what went on was featured in the show ... One 
of 
&gt; the other segments had a little boy who sees a girl spirit who 
plays 
&gt; with the toys in his room. I was speaking to him backstage and his 
&gt; stories were amazing! He can&#x27;t wait to move.

&gt; &gt; Debbie--will the show be available in its entirety online? If 
not, 
&gt; &gt; after it airs, can you give us a synopsis of what it covered and 
&gt; what 
&gt; &gt; you found?
