<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>C&#x27;mon Steve--I know I&#x27;ve replied to many of your files, visited your  
site, and spent hours listening to audio.

Yes, it would be nice if more people commented, but sometimes they  
don&#x27;t because there is nothing to say other than, &quot;I hear it.&quot; Which  
raises the question--do we want a thousand posts containing, &quot;I hear  
it&quot;?  If you want specific feedback on a file, let people know what  
you&#x27;re looking for (&quot;Is this really saying this?&quot;, &quot;Is this a man or  
a woman?&quot; &quot;What do you think the last word might be?&quot;) I think it  
might encourage meaningful participation.

Oddly enough, people are talking right now because no one is posting  
loads of files, almost certainly because of the holidays. And there  
is nothing wrong with people talking about issues that concern them.  
Sometimes I feel like the list is full of shopping tips for obscure  
paranormal-makeover equipment, but I don&#x27;t begrudge anyone for  
posting about it.

There are many levels to this list--to any list--which is, at it&#x27;s  
basis a social network.

HMO and such and if you post a file or two today, I promise I will  
comment. Scout&#x27;s honor! ;)

&gt; Hey, Misty at least people are responding to your audio files. I
&gt; haven&#x27;t had any feedback on my posts in months. Being that this
&gt; board has nothing to do with ITC research anymore and more about
&gt; appliances that are broken. People are probably wondering why
&gt; occasionally some are posting audio files, maybe we are wrong for
&gt; imposing on their chat room. I have a toaster on the fritz so maybe
&gt; i can join in on the chat now.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Happy New Year to you too! Thanks for tryin but sometimes its
&gt; just not for everyone ears. Never know who hears what til ya post it
&gt; =) I dont worry about quality so much anymore because whats crystal
&gt; clear for some sounds like blahbedeblah to others.

&gt; &gt; Misty,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Happy new year, I listened to the files a few times and unless you
&gt; read
&gt; &gt; what they are labeled I could not hear anything but misty in the
&gt; second one
&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t think it was quality just volume of the voice itself.

&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know if maybe the audio pick up from the box wasn&#x27;t
&gt; very good,
&gt; &gt; but I can&#x27;t make out much of that either. It sounds like the
&gt; recordings
&gt; &gt; I do with a cell phone. I think you&#x27;d have to be there to judge it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Personally I&#x27;m always disappointed at my stuff being out there, and
&gt; &gt; the incredible lack of clarity obatained with it, to me that&#x27;s a
&gt; huge
&gt; &gt; failure! I know the stuff works, but how to get it to a level that
&gt; can
&gt; &gt; be understood by most, that&#x27;s the problem, and my focus at the
&gt; moment.
&gt; &gt; The Mini Box is big step in that direction, so some of the pressure
&gt; if
&gt; &gt; off, but I still need to get my boxes to professional level.
