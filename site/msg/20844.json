Is it decernment, or denial? When you look at the weather, the earthquakes, the actions of humanity--getting dumber and dumber by the day, the active debunking going on, the lack of news coverage for comets--it begins to look like something is going on. I don&#39;t buy the Jesus stuff either, but that doesn&#39;t negate the facts.\n\n As far other planets in the solar system, I think &quot;science&quot; has it all wrong, I think most are habitable in some form. I got voices saying they came from the sixth planet, presumably in this system, and once again I have ask, how would anyone else &quot;know better&quot;? I don&#39;t believe constant and daily Earthquakes are the norm, or they wouldn&#39;t be mentioned in the bible as a sign of the times. I think this planet is severely fractured, and very little holding it together. \n What happens when you don&#39;t keep moving parts lubricated--as in pulling out all the natural oil of the planet? I think we are living on a future asteroid belt as it ceases up and flies apart. Yet again, how would anyone &quot;know better&quot;? With only a slight amount of research, anyone can punch holes in every &quot;scientific&quot; theory all day long. Some dweeb in a university has a thought and it becomes gospel. Some duffus does a &quot;thought experiment&quot; and it&#39;s irrefutable--how the f--- does that work!? You think it, therefore it is by virture of titles and degree?  If you don&#39;t have titles and degrees, anything you think of is nonsensical. \n\n yeah, rambling of a lunatickingnutcase.\n\nF-S"}
