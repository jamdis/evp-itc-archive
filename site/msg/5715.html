<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks, Steve. I&#x27;m going through everything I recorded before I  
finally got the various softwares I needed. All of the stuff I just  
posted is from this one amazing session on January 2. If you combine  
six other sessions I&#x27;ve done, there isn&#x27;t as much as what came  
through that day. I&#x27;m floored.

&gt; I think you are on to some good communication. Your files seem to be
&gt; really clear and all as titled.
&gt;
&gt; Great Job and keep going.
