The majority of \nmessages I have been getting are direct answers to questions or a \nphrase or sentence that is obviously put together by different bits and \npieces of the FM signals. I would like to know what you think of the \nmanual sweep versus the automatic, I know Steve does his research using \nthe automatic FM sweep box and I have been working with the manual \nmethod. When I listen to Steve&#39;s captures they seem to be very fast and \nthat to me makes it harder to understand and gives the opportunity for \nmistaking the sound of a word. the manual method on the other hand is \nslower and may give the opportunity to catch a broadcast word or two \nlike I said so the question is which one do you think is more reliable ?\n\nBruce"}
