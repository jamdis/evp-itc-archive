Actual conversations were \ndocumented, and even help provided on ways to better contact and \ninterface with the spirits, given by the spirits themselves.\n\n- I don&#39;t know about specs on the Ion Lamp. I just wanted to try it \nsince it is active light frequency that changes or is manipulated \nvery easily.\n\n- I&#39;ll keep your ideas in mind when I do my next set.\n\n- Thanks for the advice about finding mediums.

Anything significant? \n&gt; Kinda wish we both lived a bit closer, we might have been able to \nwork together on some projects... :D  We live in Michigan. \n&gt; Al\nMike, Is there any research that says that an ion lamp is hyper \nsensitive? \n\nYou might wish to hookup your EMF detectors in such a fashion that \neach one showing a response would be video taped. If one has a \npositive, then it might show up on your video.\n\nAlso, if you are interested in locating a medium, look in your local \nphone book for a local spiritualist church. They will have many \nmediums attending. Before you ask to test them, please, build up a \nfriendship first. I was recently asked to be tested by some locals \nbut their proposal was very poorly written and had no real tests or \nconclusions, per se. I turned them down. \n\nAl\n&gt; \n&gt; -- &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Funny you should mention using a medium to communicate with this \n&gt; system. That dediated group in the 1960&#39;s first used mediums in \n&gt; conjunction with their electronic equipment.\n&gt; The mediums were used to relay the words or feelings they heard or \n&gt; felt from the spirits that were attracted to the different modes of \n&gt; frequencies that the experimentors.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m in Colorado Springs, Colorado; in the same neighborhood where \n&gt; Nikola Tesla did his experiments while in this city for about 6-8 \n&gt; months. His lab was located about a 3 minute drive from my house.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;threadsintyme@&quot; \n&gt; &lt;Threadsintyme@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mike,\n&gt; &gt; I have an idea for you to think about and possibly consider \n&gt; trying. mediums, as you know are about a dime per dozen these days. \n&gt; Have you considered video taping a medium before, during and after \na \n&gt; reading was being done? \n&gt; &gt; Once while some of our smaller group in Muskegon, MI were out \nghost \n&gt; hunting one afternoon, I sensed a spirit nearby and asked some of \nthe \n&gt; members to use their EMF equipment to see if they could pickup \n&gt; anything. One guy had a positive reaction to a spirit that was \n&gt; standing in front of me. His EMF detector showed a few blips and \nthen \n&gt; the spirit was gone. I was still communicating with the spirit \nafter \n&gt; the blimps stopped. Might be worth trying as an experiment.\n&gt; &gt; Mike, where are you located?\n&gt; &gt; Al\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Al,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To answer your first question I provide this link:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S-4e-wxd6U\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s a video that better explains how I think it might work. \n(Just \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; couple of possibilites).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To answer your second question... I have done three \nexperimentation \n&gt; &gt; sessions so far, and the results differ. In one I got no \nresponse, \n&gt; &gt; and in the other two I did get action but I&#39;m unsure on what \ncaused \n&gt; &gt; it. I&#39;m reviewing it further.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My use of the Ion lamp, which is away from the traditional &#39;video-\n&gt; &gt; loop&#39; method is based on things I&#39;ve read from those who were \ninto \n&gt; &gt; this EVP/ITC thing way before us. Back in the 1960&#39;s there was \nmuch \n&gt; &gt; experimentation going on that involved a varied range of \n&gt; frequencies, \n&gt; &gt; including light frequencies. Even house plants were considered \ninto \n&gt; &gt; the EVP/ITC equation (Maybe I&#39;ll try that next).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My use of the Ion lamp goes along with a continued desire to \n&gt; further \n&gt; &gt; the work of the dedicated group from the 1960&#39;s... and continue \nto \n&gt; &gt; see if &#39;other&#39; ideas work.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After all... sweeping radio signals, and snowy video pictures are \n&gt; &gt; only a couple of snippets of the frequencies available for \n&gt; &gt; experimentation. Even my limited idea of what the Ion lamp might \ndo \n&gt; &gt; could be way off... but I have to try it. I might be surprised \nwhat \n&gt; &gt; it might be capable of. It might not only offer increased \nintensity \n&gt; &gt; and stimulation. Maybe it could even offer more than that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll keep trying new things... and I&#39;ll make sure to share them \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; the group.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for asking...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;threadsintyme@&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;Threadsintyme@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An interesting setup, Mike...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I do have a question though.,..what is the ion lamp for? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have you had any success photographing any spirits?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Al\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -- &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For those who care to see...
