<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I hear &quot;set to break.&quot; I don&#x27;t know if changes the meaning in any  
way, but there it is...

I think that if the vet tries and fails, then &quot;freeing&quot; is an option,  
but I wouldn&#x27;t follow that voice&#x27;s advice without having made an  
attempt to do the correct thing, from a human perspective.

&gt; We do have a dog with a broken leg, so it would seem outrageous to  
&gt; suggest the comment received about a dog and a break would be just  
&gt; a stray broadcast. I hate to have an animal suffer, but what a  
&gt; piece of evidence! This is what I mean  by judging content and  
&gt; context.
&gt;
&gt;  I don&#x27;t ask questions, I did not ask about the dog. I was only  
&gt; testing the #24 box, and announced, as usuall, that I was doing an  
&gt; EVP recording to test the box.
