Calm down Bruce, this debate has gone on long before you posted anything. This is probably as old as the community that spawned it. Don't take anything said as being personal. Everyone can see your intentions were pure, its the concept thats being debated not your ritual.

Frank R.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate










  


    
            I swore I would not get wraped up in this debate



BUT!



The reason I came up with this whole protection ritual was that some 

of the new researchers where



expressing a rational concern for negative responces that they were 

recieving through thier boxes.



The short protection ritual that I posted is not meant to quell 

irrational histerical fear, and I agree



with rosemary that anyone suffering from such fear should rethink 

thier involment in the paranormal research field.



that being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal comfort 

to those new individuals that had never 



expperienced spiritual negativity. And to help ease them into 

aproaching a session eventually with confidence



and determination as well as full curiousity for all types of the 

communication we recieve.



My initial post of the ritual file was done with the best of 

intentions and meant to be another tool available for those who felt 



they needed or wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer 

ritual, I don't think it is really worthy of all this debate.



Use it, don't use it. It's there if you want it. Also I must say 

there are two kinds of fear the kind that is natural and a god 



given emotion for self preservation, ie the fright and flight reflex 

that is an instinctive trait in all of us. Then you have the 



irrational dibilitating phobic fear that can turn an individual into 

a frozen statue. That type of fear I believe is unhealthy



and should be addressed and dealt with and learned how to harness. I 

also believe that anyone that harbors that type of fear 



would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a case of such 

fear it would already be present and doing a small protection 



ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take it for what it is, 

something to utilize in our box of tools like an emf meter.



you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the bottom of your tool 

box at home that you inherited from your grandfather and have never 

used



but if you come across that odd nut that needs tightening somedsy you 

will be glad you have it.



Bruce
