<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>So you&#x27;ve moved back inside for the winter, eh?  Glad to see I&#x27;m not the
only one with a nosy cat!

This box will sound great when it&#x27;s ready.  Whatever you were doing in file
5 worked some mighty mojo because it was nonstop whole phrases; how much of
that file do you think could be radio bleed through?

Since it is a single supply, will it just be linear?  $3 very well spent.

This is what my ears hear:

File 3:
.01 go for a walk
.05 melody on
.08 what you dissecting
.11 good for you
.13 help

File 4:
.03 Tim over
.11 poison

File 5:
.02 you can keep this some head
.04 yes ok
.05 we got him
.06 Frank
.07 can you hear me now?
.08 think you&#x27;re truly on
.09 getting coin, you?
.11 ?where the leaves got dumped?  where did these get ????

File 6:
.01 Hultay even (first word cut off, could be &#x27;is&#x27; or &#x27;why&#x27;s&#x27;)
.03 and the ones hear voices
.06 hey enough
.07 thank you for (?might radio broadcast?)

File 8:
.01 I think there&#x27;s a better used receiver

Good stuff, Frank.

&gt;  Had a Sony AM/FM/Cassette/CD boom box that I got two years ago for $3. I
&gt; made a sweep board for it this afternoon, then found it had a seperate tuner
&gt; board. So I liberated the tuner from the rest, and striped everything else
&gt; for parts. It make primo box! This runs on six volts and takes a signal wire
&gt; to change bands.
&gt;
&gt;  #6 starts out &quot;Is Hultay even---wormwood&quot;. #8 is cool &quot;I think that he
&gt; videos this reciever&quot;, after that &quot;the alamo&#x27;s on ten meter basement(?)&quot; teh
&gt; 10 meter band is at 28 to 29.5 mhz, it&#x27;s one of the ham bands. So is
&gt; basement the bottom if 10 meters, at about 28.5Mhz if I remember right? Now
&gt; that&#x27;s a trip, cuz I was switching between AM and FM.
