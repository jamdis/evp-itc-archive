im amazed you can get it trimmed down so far.  i never concentrated on that bnecause there were always so many audio people around.
   
  btw-  very odd thing.  something has changed my cheap digital audio recorder so that it sweeps at about 1 one full sweep per second.  i guess it will linearly sweep whatever input is plugged in. that would sure be enough to make frank happy!  ....although he might complain the digital recorder isnt quite cheapo enough.
   
  this is a digital memo recorder with 100 enumerated storage channels that hold one minute each.  the unauthorized linear sweep is sweeping accross all them
   
   
  i have learned that recordings from this recorder cant be transferred to tape without making them unintelligible.
   
  crude oscilliscope trace shows narrow bandwidth with some phonemes missing--possibly they are auto-generated by the trained/educated/multilingual listeners hearing/speech processing brain center.  much to do today.

  I used to get many other languages in my evp. Once in a while I will actually understand it and save it. They think more together and speak with one voice as asked so I dont get things I cant understand quite as much anymore. 
   
  Heres just a few examples for the french speaking. (Attaching to this email. If you dont get attachments and want to recieve them you must put your group settings on "individual emails") For the non french speakers they are simply asking "do you speak french" and some remark about a "bad boy"

to date, i can find no explanation why so many ghosts seem to speak 
only french or german-sometimes obsolete british "english" with a 
snobby accent. older or believing cultures, perhaps?

one possibility staring me smack in the face is the possibly 
irreparable trauma to the collective Id rendered by world war one.

........so maybe were looking at a perennial lost generation , now; 
hard to face.

ps, my wife is a multi degree'd french language professor and frank 
sumption fan.
