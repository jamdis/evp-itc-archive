So , your answer says to me the diferents results take origin by materials , not much the dimensions , isnt it? . Another important question , what is the range of frecuencies of the triangle wave ? I know about the model of radio determine that , but what is the common range ? ... hz? , khz? ... \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Aluminum seems to work the best. I got a voice that sounded like Raudive\n&gt; saying copper. I have used plastic and wood. Different materials seem to\n&gt; allow different levels, but it&#39;s hard to tell for sure who/what is talking.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Folding the tube seems to make it act like a larger tube. With just a long\n&gt; straight tube the sound tends to be tinny. I made a chamber 12 inches square\n&gt; and 4 feet long from MDF board lined with aluminum foil years ago, the\n&gt; voices were almost demonic sounding, so I took it apart.\n&gt; \n&gt;  The only difference with the hacked radio is the sweep. With the hack radio\n&gt; the sweep steps so the radio is tuned in 10khz increments. With the box it&#39;s\n&gt; a continuous sweep, linear uses a triangle wave.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Aug 20, 2010 at 4:01 PM, Luis &lt;luispucp098@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ok Frank , thanks for your answer , but , what material you recommend for\n&gt; &gt; the best results? , what is the diferent whith the long of tubes in results\n&gt; &gt; ? and could you say a hacked radio produce the iddentical results like a box\n&gt; &gt; built ?

The effect is like a mechanical sound filter. The\n&gt; &gt; larger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the siaze the lower tyhe effected frequencies. I use tubing so it can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; made smaller to fit inside a cabinet. I don&#39;t even measure anything when\n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; make an echo chamber, it&#39;s just made to fit whatever cabinet I&#39;m using.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The boxes work without the chamber, but the chamber seems to add\n&gt; &gt; something,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; maybe a space where the sound can be more easily manipulated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, Aug 20, 2010 at 1:40 PM, Luis &lt;luispucp098@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I need to know about the echo chamber ... dimensions, materials ,\n&gt; &gt; anyone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knows it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
