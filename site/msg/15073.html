Well what I meant was that if we are keeping sound separate from the EM spe=
ctrum, then it is generated as a bi-product of some other thing's movements=
 or vibrations. Such movements create waves in the environment that we hear=
 as sound.

        No, that's not what I mean. By nature EM w=
aves don't normally make sound. The HAARP issue in the NW is believe to be =
caused by some harmonic of the actual EM wave. This is what I mean by secon=
dary effect. EM waves can still effect the physical, which is the reason mi=
crowaves can cook you if the power is amped high enough or causes a birds t=
o twitch in its transmission beam. I have stepped into a microwave beam at =
moderate power in while in the military. It doesn't hurt (at least at the p=
ower it was at) but it sure made me feel very strange. Of course microwaves=
 have very short wavelengths compared to VLF, ULF or SLF.

                  EM waves at the=
 VLF and ULF level can give off sound but only as a secondary phenomenon. I=

               Tell me where the seperation on the spectrum takes place bet=
ween 300Hz and 300KHz. Yes, soundwaves cause pressure waves that our ears r=
ead as vibration and our mind translates as sound. The waves are still on t=

 the scale. What I mean by power can be directll translated to volume or am=

    No. Sounds waves are not on the electromagnet spectrum nor are they a f=

 air (or in other substances).  Our ears detect these pressure waves and tr=

    Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and telemetry trans=
mitting wave but the waves also have a physical effect on our environment b=
y causing molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A little lower than th=

                                Here=

                                It was me and another g=

ther digital video recorder that I leave beside my night vision camera. Tha=

                I have long felt the true EVP does not come from sound wave=

              This instance with the recorders may back that theory up. Tha=
t other recorder should have picked that voice up if it were sound waves in=
 the environment.

                                I am attaching the clip =
of this 3rd voice. The file that is named "01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip.=
 You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", and then another comes in right af=
ter that. I think I know what it says.

                                Aga=
in, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear this until playb=
ack. It isn't clear, so I am not as excited about it as my one's from the l=

                                I have a run=
ning theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exact=
ly where they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. I=
f you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequency then if=
 you add or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or alternate fr=
equency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have =
an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then yo=
u will have a intermediate difference frequency at 9KHz, well within human =
hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic=
 equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this =
theory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few inches of the rec=
order.

                                We are able to reproduce this affec=
t in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics an=
d audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audi=

 The only thing that

 the electromagnietic spectrum. 
                                Sound wave=

                                farther=
