When these people get an answer that may or may not be\n&gt; heard by all, they feel that it is indeed from a loved one and it\n&gt; hits them in the heart as if it was real.  I would love to hear a\n&gt; recorded session from start to finish as an investigator.  After all\n&gt; this research is for all not just &quot;30&quot;....  :-)\n&gt;"}
