I think that is a valid theory Sharon.=C2=A0 Different people seem to have =
different ideas about what can and can't be done with these radios.=C2=A0 I=
 don't think testing those ideas is necessarily 'ridiculous'.=C2=A0 If you =
have any ideas about what the radios can do, and how to test that idea for =
validity, I'd be happy and try to test around that too.

      I think this test is a bit ridiculous . First of all when =

able to get an answer but what your trying to do will never work . like I s=
