I always save the whole file in wav format then do my clips as mp3. Then I =
have the original for analysis. 
=A0
As far as pixelization of non sounds/w=
hite noise whos to say that isnt being manipulated by them as well LOL. Wat=
er is a form of white noise. I seem to remember some experiments done with =
blank tapes/film, no recording=A0done yet there were voices/images there. I=
 find it all interesting.
=A0
Just a thought. Ok off to work now!

Be a bit careful of fo=

=A0=A0 While some formats (like wav) can store the audio very close to the =

 the audio is fairly clear to begin with.=A0 But with sound sources with a =
lot of noise (like evps), this can not only obscure any real sounds, but pi=
xelize non-sounds (like white noise) and make them start to sound like spee=
ch.

So mp3 might be good for sharing the data, once you've already formed =
an opinion based on an analysis of the wav file.=A0 But mp3 is not good as =
a medium for analysis.=A0 It can lead to many false positives and misinterp=
retations.
