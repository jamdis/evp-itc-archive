So far, your claims that this is not possible are holding true.

[EVP-ITC] Experiment 2 - RESULTS!

Thanks to everyone who part=
icipated in Experiment 2.

On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on top o=
f my computer monitor, right in front of me, and left it there until noon D=
enver time on Monday, 7/19/2010. This experiment asked for participants to =
determine what that object was. Vague or partial answers would not be count=
ed (for example, just giving a color, shape, size, what it's made of, etc):=
 we're looking for what it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver tim=
e Monday won't count. Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders=
, or any other means they chose. 


In order to keep me honest, I took a pi=
cture of the object at the start of the experiment and loaded it to the Fil=
es section (RJ folder) of this group. The idea with this file is that you c=
ould download it at the beginning of the experiment and 'keep it safe' on y=
our computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I would post the password =
so you can reveal the contents of the file. That way, you were in control o=
f the original image during the entire time, not me. 


Passworded pdf: htt=
p://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ20100716. pdf

The p=
assword for that file is: 2plus2isFour

Instructions, if you need them for =
the other files, are also in that RJ folder.

So to the results:

Number of=
 participants: 6
Total tries: 29
Ambiguous answers: 0
Correct answers: 0

O=
bject: Chair

Object picture: http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC=
/files/ RJ/RJ20100716. jpg

As a little side experiment, on Monday I also a=
sked if anyone had gotten any answers that might indicate an article of clo=
thing (though I did not say why I was asking). One theory is that the human=
 operator can be influenced by things they already know or suspect, and so =
interpret audio with their own personal 'educated guesses', that would diff=
er from what they would hear had they not known those things. This side exp=
eriment did indicate some support for that theory, since before I mentioned=
 'articles of clothing', no one included an article of clothing in their re=
sults. But after I mentioned it, several reports of clothing began to appea=
r. I did not add these tries to the results above.


If anyone has any obse=
rvations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let me know. Again, thanks to=
 everyone who participated in this experiment.
