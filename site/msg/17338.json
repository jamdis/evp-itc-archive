If you did then please refresh my memory. This seems to\n&gt; more about commenting on what others share for you than it is about doing\n&gt; any research yourself. Im not sure what you are looking for, if you are here\n&gt; to learn, correspond, or if you are just here to get a rise out of others\n&gt; but to be honest I do not have time for it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Whether Frank bans anyone or not is up to him entirely. But I have warned\n&gt; you before and I am saying it again. Cut the crap and move on. That goes for\n&gt; ALL of you. I dont mind discussions, I dont mind differences of opinion but\n&gt; I do mind BS.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have research to share then do so, if your research yeilds no\n&gt; results then state it as such. If your only purpose for being in this group\n&gt; is to question others, disect them, and cause negative discussions then\n&gt; perhaps you are wasting your time here. You are definitely wasting mine.\n&gt;\n&gt; Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nWho a e you e e ing o? I ha e sha ed a ew EVP's wi h his g oup asking wha hey hea . I do his \ne e y ime I ge an EVP.
