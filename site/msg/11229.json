Another way is tune a radio \nin between stations on nights where there is distant stations \nfadding in a out randomly, or when there&#39;s skip (same thing as \nfadding) the sprits will use this as raw audio, short wave would be \nthe same. I have one box with shortwave that&#39;s sweepable. It covers \nthe 31, and 49 meter bands. The sweep can also be done just as \neffectively by hand. \n\n There&#39;s seems to be something a bit more going on, such as the \nvoices seem to be made inside the electronics, no matter what method \nis being used. Radio seems to be an important medium that seems to \nallow universal access the entities. \n\n You can also tune in a shortwave station in a language you do not \nunderstand, announce you&#39;re doing an EVP recording, and record \ndierectly from the radio&#39;s speaker. That will at times produce \nmeaningful messages.\n\n My first advice is to forget all the paranormal BS everyone thinks \nthey know, 99% of that is Hollywood, and based only on urban legend. \nSpirit is not some retarted half human thing no longer capable of \nany higher funcition, it is us, the physical side, that is quite \nlimited in both thought and action. \n\n Oh yeah, spirits travel, there is no need to go the supposedly \nhaunted locations. \n\n I&#39;m not a medium, but I am kinda half baked sometimes.\n\n Frank-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;threadsintyme@...&quot; \n&lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Why do you need to &quot;sweep&quot; the AM spectrum?"}
