I&#39;ll have to try those in conjunction with the Ion \nlamp.  My second camera could catch any indication on the EMF \ndetectors.\n\nThanks for the great tip!\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;threadsintyme@...&quot; \n&lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike,\n&gt; I watched your youtube link and found it really interesting. \n&gt; Was wondering if you also might use something like a Trifield EMF \ndetector? That might be a better indicator than the ion lamp. \n&gt; The problem with the ion lamp is that would something incorporeal \nas a spirit trigger the ion lamp? I don&#39;t know...you did show a \nreaction to the magnetic field from a live entity...but a spirit \nentity is an entirely different matter.  It has been shown that some \nemf detectors (such as Trifield meters) are capable of picking up \neven slight magnetic changes to the environment. \n&gt; I don&#39;t know if an ion lamp is that sensitive...\n&gt; Thanks for your link!\n&gt; Al\n&gt; \n&gt; -- &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Al,\n&gt; \n&gt; To answer your first question I provide this link:\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S-4e-wxd6U\n&gt; It&#39;s a video that better explains how I think it might work. (Just \na \n&gt; couple of possibilites).\n&gt; \n&gt; To answer your second question... I have done three experimentation \n&gt; sessions so far, and the results differ. In one I got no response, \n&gt; and in the other two I did get action but I&#39;m unsure on what caused \n&gt; it. I&#39;m reviewing it further.\n&gt; \n&gt; My use of the Ion lamp, which is away from the traditional &#39;video-\n&gt; loop&#39; method is based on things I&#39;ve read from those who were into \n&gt; this EVP/ITC thing way before us. Back in the 1960&#39;s there was much \n&gt; experimentation going on that involved a varied range of \nfrequencies, \n&gt; including light frequencies. Even house plants were considered into \n&gt; the EVP/ITC equation (Maybe I&#39;ll try that next).\n&gt; \n&gt; My use of the Ion lamp goes along with a continued desire to \nfurther \n&gt; the work of the dedicated group from the 1960&#39;s... and continue to \n&gt; see if &#39;other&#39; ideas work.\n&gt; \n&gt; After all... sweeping radio signals, and snowy video pictures are \n&gt; only a couple of snippets of the frequencies available for \n&gt; experimentation. Even my limited idea of what the Ion lamp might do \n&gt; could be way off... but I have to try it. I might be surprised what \n&gt; it might be capable of. It might not only offer increased intensity \n&gt; and stimulation. Maybe it could even offer more than that.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll keep trying new things... and I&#39;ll make sure to share them \nwith \n&gt; the group.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for asking...\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;threadsintyme@&quot; \n&gt; &lt;Threadsintyme@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; An interesting setup, Mike...\n&gt; &gt; I do have a question though.,..what is the ion lamp for? \n&gt; &gt; Have you had any success photographing any spirits?\n&gt; &gt; Al\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For those who care to see...
