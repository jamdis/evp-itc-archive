The only file I heard pretty close to what you labeled it was the first one.
to me the rest are nothing, that may be because I am so used to listening to box files.

        I can hear that. Only one problem with that, I dont use a "box" never have. However they have been talking about my "box" for quite a long time. Perhaps ST is what they mean. It's what most of the boxes have come to be based on.

      I just opened some files that Misty sent (btw Misty - I really 
appreciate your help!) and then I spoke to the "MiniBox" ... 

I've been asking a question every 10-15 seconds ..I listen back and 
disregard and cut out what's not clear (or doesn't make sense to me).. 
I expect (lol- hope) to have the question and answer included in the 10-
15 seconds ..
