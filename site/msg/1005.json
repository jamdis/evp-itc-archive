Just interested in\nresearch, documentation, etc. \n\nMy main interest right now in ITC (beyond as a tool for communication)\nis in establishing guidelines/protocols/etc. for evaluation of\nrecieved communications.  I.E. you recieve a valid message (a\nconfirmed ITC), now you have to go about validating its content. \nFrank and I had a few discussions last year regarding context and\nmeaning of some of the material he was recieving last year around this\ntime (the changes that were to occur around May through July in 2006)\nfor example.\n\nI&#39;m very interested in hearing other list member&#39;s experience in this\narea and look forward to contributing to this discussion list.\n\nMarty"}
