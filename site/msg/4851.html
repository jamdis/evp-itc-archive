Just look at the date to see the 2 files from today. I was verifying 
communication for others to hear. So i used Babs as an example of an 
uncommon name as well as mine and bruce's name. The first file 
probably got lost on this board at this point with all the audio 
uploads recently....JULI !!!!! Just kidding, but listen to the 2 new 
files from today in the folder and let me know what you guys think. I 
already know i have good communication with my two friends on the other 
side named Mike and Lisa, but i want to show others that what i get is 
real. If anybody wants to do a test session through Skype just e-mail 
me and we can set something up.

Thanx,
-Steve H.
