On #5 I put in a 1000 hz square wave generator, and got some \nof the clearest voices with that box.  I could switch in a 1000hz signal, \nmixed with the tuner audio going to the echo box. As usual, after a couple \nsessions I gave the box away.  I wanted to experiment some more with that, \nbut have been too tied up just amking the basic boxes.  so this time I made \nan add on board, and ran the tuner audio to it so one channel can be mixed \nwith the tone generator, before going ot the speaker driver for the left \nspeaker. The tone is kind of a Spiricom idea, and a square wave is used \nbecause it contains a lot of harmonics which can add to the audio from the \ntuner.\n\nFrank-S\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nhttp://newlivehotmail.com\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_376b_787a_5574\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;Add-On-Toneboard.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;Add-On-Toneboard.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_376b_787a_5574--"}
