<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Kristin,

As you can see, I may lose money, but that&#x27;s okay.  At least some 
others can test these things.  I&#x27;m not out to market them, just 
thought I could get a few other 12-470s out there. :-)

Yes, the part number for the cable that I use is Radio Shack 42-2496 
(Y-Cable Adapter).

- Mike

&gt; Hey Mike - great idea to put these on EBAY!  If I hadn&#x27;t already 
begun
&gt; purchasing items to duplicate your set up this would have saved me 
tons of
&gt; time.  I am waiting on a digi recorder and need to get the y 
cable.  Do you
&gt; have a part number for that cable? 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks so much for all that you do for us!

&gt; 
&gt; Well, the wife says... &quot;Get some of these ghost things out of here!&quot;
&gt; So, I have begun putting my 12.470 Ghost Box Systems on ebay.
&gt; 
&gt; It cost me about $80 to put this system together, but since I would 
&gt; like to get some of these out there for people to test, I put the 
&gt; starting bid at only $55 with no reserve and made it a 3 day 
auction.
