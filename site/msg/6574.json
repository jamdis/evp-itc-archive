So upon this request, myself, Joel, Jeff and Nancy brought  \n&gt; several of the boxes to help assist the owner in some unanswered  \n&gt; historical questions.  This session was amazing!  Although I can  \n&gt; not disclosure the name of the location our little session may just  \n&gt; be the exposure that the other side wants.  We will be turning our  \n&gt; findings over to the owner and production company, and who knows,  \n&gt; the box just may make its debut on the big screen.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would love your input on the attached files before I send them  \n&gt; on.  I have many and have additional sessions still left to review.\n&gt;\n&gt; I thank you all in advance for you help and assistance!\n&gt;\n&gt; Juli\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private &  \n&gt; confidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is  \n&gt; addressed to.\n&gt;\n&gt; No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or  \n&gt; forwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.\n&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;10, can you confirm the child was ten.mp3&gt;&lt;Do we need  \n&gt; to cross some of the entities over, yes,  \n&gt; rested.mp3&gt;&lt;grounded.mp3&gt;&lt;is that why he can&#39;t cross over,  \n&gt; RIGHT.mp3&gt;&lt;Tom, There is one.mp3&gt;\n\n\nVe y in e es ing s u , Juli. :)AnnOn Jan 31, 2008, a 6:38 PM, juli elazquez w o e: O e las weekend he owne o a amous Illinois haun ed loca ion ( he elease o he mo ie is no due ou un il la e his yea ).  The owne eques ed ha my o ganiza ion b ing he box o he house.  So upon his eques , mysel , Joel, Je and Nancy b ough se e al o he boxes o help assis he owne in some unanswe ed his o ical ques ions.  This session was amazing!  Al hough I can no disclosu e he name o he loca ion ou li le session may jus be he exposu e ha he o he side wan s.  We will be u ning ou indings o e o he owne and p oduc ion company, and who knows, he box jus may make i s debu on he big sc een.   I would lo e you inpu on he a ached iles be o e I send hem on.  I ha e many and ha e addi ional sessions s ill le o e iew.    I hank you all in ad ance o you help and assis ance!   Juli     The con en s o his ele onic co espondence is p i a e & con iden ial and mean only o he pa y and/o pa ies i is add essed o.    No pa o his email ansmission may be publicly pos ed o o wa ded o o he pa ies wi hou explici w i en pe mission."}
