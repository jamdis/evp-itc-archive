They say the gizmo only works with recorders that have direct monitoring during record mode. Sooo its a visual guide to what the recorder is hearing during a record sesson. Seems not much benefit for $145.\nJEFF\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ursula&quot; &lt;kalinu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.project-reveal.com/#/the-evp-field-processor-efp/4544723250\n&gt;"}
