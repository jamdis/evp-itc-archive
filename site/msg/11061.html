that he have everything turned off and he said he did. However, he 
forgot to turn his fan off. I now have over an hours worth of recording 
of a fan running. I just started using Gold Wave. Does anyone - without 
getting to technical - know how to remove the fan?

Any help would be appreciated.

Mick
