I did a bit of uploading to my Esnips file database online for you guys. I posted examples of a few of the various methods Ive tested over the years. I'm still in the process of updating it and will continue to do so when time allows and new material becomes available. Who knows eventually maybe I will figure out a keyword search system so I can upload my ENTIRE database online for you guys to hunt thru. Someone may want to search thru thousands of files and find info or loved ones names. For now this simple version will have to do.
   
  You should all sign up for a free account there. It's 50 gigs of online space for free to save your files and photos or whatever. Plus you can interconnect and link up with others in the community if you wish. If ya join add me as a friend and I will reciprocate so we can keep updated on each others progress.
   
  This yahoo groups space is VERY limited, so I will probably post most of the new stuff I get on esnips or as file attachments to posts.
