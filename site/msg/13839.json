Asking for a specific, predetermi=\r\nned number is not subjective.  It is about as objective as you can get. \n\n =\r\n                 I am not trying to prove anything, or rule out any possibi=\r\nlities.  I am suggesting a method to determine, statistically, how accurate=\r\n someone=E2=80=99s board, or methodology, might be.  Lets say I select two =\r\npeople, and in separate rooms, I give each a spelling test.  Person 1 gets =\r\n100% right.  Person 2 gets 50% right.  Now, if I later give them a second s=\r\npelling test, I can start with the theory that Person 1 will get near 100% =\r\ncorrect, and Person 2 will get near 50% correct.  This doesn=E2=80=99t mean=\r\n they will, or that they have gotten these scores in the past.  But statist=\r\nically, it is a reasonable assumption at this point.  After the second test=\r\n, I can examine the deviation of the results from the first test, and updat=\r\ne the statistics.   If the deviation remains small (if the results remain s=\r\nimilar), then I can more and more safely assume that person 1 will have a v=\r\nery high chance of getting a word right, and person 2 will have half that. =\r\n If the deviation swings wildly, than my statistics may not be very predict=\r\nive after all.\n\n                  The same is true with the board.  As you =\r\nsaid, getting this number wrong doesn=E2=80=99t say past answers were wrong=\r\n, or that future answers will be wrong.  And it is possible it could have b=\r\neen right by mere chance (though very unlikely: winning the lottery is more=\r\n likely than guessing one number out of a billion).  What we=E2=80=99d have=\r\n is one single objective data point.  It gives a starting point for reasona=\r\nble assumptions.  As you noted, after more such tests, those assumptions ma=\r\ny start changing.  It would be interesting to see how they change, if they =\r\ndo.\n\n                  Different people seem to have different feelings abo=\r\nut the board.  Some believe it gives great results.  Some are suspicious, e=\r\nven dubious.  And there are plenty of opinions in between.  My test is not =\r\nfor those who believe it is statistically likely that psychic tampering wou=\r\nld occur, or that the board=E2=80=99s performance is just not testable, whi=\r\nch is the camp I gather you are in.  My test is only good for that segment =\r\nof this population who believes or wonders if the board is capable of givin=\r\ng a straight objective answer to a straight objective questions, and that s=\r\nuch performance is testable.  To address one of your examples, while it can=\r\nnot show that an entity is reading my mind if it gets the numbers right, it=\r\n can conversely show that an actual entity is not reading my mind (or that =\r\nit is not performing remote viewing, or that it is not predicting the futur=\r\ne of what the right answer is when it is revealed, or that it is not being =\r\nforthright in its answers) if it cannot get the numbers right in the first =\r\nplace.  But if these things are true, then it begs the question of its accu=\r\nracy anyway.\n\n                  So again, this is one data point, in what c=\r\nould be a number of tests, for those who are not ruling out that testing is=\r\n possible, and even desirable, when believing, or acting on, information ga=\r\nthered by using this kind of board.  \n\n\n                  --- On Wed, 4/15/=\r\n09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n     =\r\n               From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. co=\r\nm&gt;\n                    Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: An alternative to the usu=\r\nal ghost hunter stuff.\n                    To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n   =\r\n                 Date: Wednesday, April 15, 2009, 2:45 PM\n\n\n\n              =\r\n      It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to test it, it is that I can&#39;t.

Asking for a \n    =\r\n              specific, predetermined number is not subjective.&nbsp; It is=\r\n \n                  about as objective as you can get. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am not try=\r\ning to \n                  prove anything, or rule out any possibilities.&nb=\r\nsp; I am \n                  suggesting a method to determine, statistically=\r\n, how accurate \n                  someone=E2=80=99s board, or methodology, =\r\nmight be.&nbsp; Lets say I \n                  select two people, and in sep=\r\narate rooms, I give each a \n                  spelling test.&nbsp; Person 1=\r\n gets 100% right.&nbsp; Person 2 \n                  gets 50% right.&nbsp; N=\r\now, if I later give them a second \n                  spelling test, I can s=\r\ntart with the theory that Person 1 will \n                  get near 100% co=\r\nrrect, and Person 2 will get near 50% \n                  correct.&nbsp; Thi=\r\ns doesn=E2=80=99t mean they will, or that they have \n                  gott=\r\nen these scores in the past.&nbsp; But statistically, it \n                 =\r\n is a reasonable assumption at this point.&nbsp; After the \n               =\r\n   second test, I can examine the deviation of the results from \n          =\r\n        the first test, and update the statistics.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the \n    =\r\n              deviation remains small (if the results remain similar), then=\r\n \n                  I can more and more safely assume that person 1 will ha=\r\nve a \n                  very high chance of getting a word right, and perso=\r\nn 2 will \n                  have half that.&nbsp; If the deviation swings w=\r\nildly, than my \n                  statistics may not be very predictive aft=\r\ner all.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The \n                  same is true with the board.&nbsp; As=\r\n you said, getting this \n                  number wrong doesn=E2=80=99t say=\r\n past answers were wrong, or that \n                  future answers will be=\r\n wrong.&nbsp; And it is possible it \n                  could have been righ=\r\nt by mere chance (though very unlikely: \n                  winning the lott=\r\nery is more likely than guessing one number \n                  out of a bil=\r\nlion).&nbsp; What we=E2=80=99d have is one single \n                  object=\r\nive data point.&nbsp; It gives a starting point for \n                  reas=\r\nonable assumptions.&nbsp; As you noted, after more such \n                  =\r\ntests, those assumptions may start changing.&nbsp; It would be \n           =\r\n       interesting to see how they change, if they \n                  do.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Different people seem to have different feelings \n                  a=\r\nbout the board.&nbsp; Some believe it gives great \n                  result=\r\ns.&nbsp; Some are suspicious, even dubious.&nbsp; And \n                  th=\r\nere are plenty of opinions in between.&nbsp; My test is not \n              =\r\n    for those who believe it is statistically likely that psychic \n        =\r\n          tampering would occur, or that the board=E2=80=99s performance is=\r\n just \n                  not testable, which is the camp I gather you are i=\r\nn.&nbsp; My \n                  test is only good for that segment of this p=\r\nopulation who \n                  believes or wonders if the board is capabl=\r\ne of giving a \n                  straight objective answer to a straight ob=\r\njective questions, \n                  and that such performance is testable=\r\n.&nbsp; To address one of \n                  your examples, while it cannot=\r\n show that an entity is reading \n                  my mind if it gets the n=\r\numbers right, it can conversely show \n                  that an actual enti=\r\nty is not reading my mind (or that it is \n                  not performing =\r\nremote viewing, or that it is not predicting \n                  the future =\r\nof what the right answer is when it is revealed, or \n                  that=\r\n it is not being forthright in its answers) if it cannot \n                 =\r\n get the numbers right in the first place.&nbsp; But if these \n            =\r\n      things are true, then it begs the question of its accuracy \n         =\r\n         anyway.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So again, this is one data point, in what could \n  =\r\n                be a number of tests, for those who are not ruling out that=\r\n \n                  testing is possible, and even desirable, when believing=\r\n, or \n                  acting on, information gathered by using this kind =\r\nof \n                  board.&nbsp;
