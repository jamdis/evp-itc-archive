They are very  light and comfortable for full headphones. They have thick, 
padded ear cuffs  and a padded headband. The others I have-the ear bud types, 
make my ears hurt.  On investigations I use them for live monitoring, so I 
wear them for long  periods of time.

audio. I need to  work with that and AMP them I guess. In some recordings 
(1927 is one of them)  I can't hear the voice sometimes, that is how low it 
is. But tonight I  finished my comparison recorder evaluations (ran 3 
recorders that night) my  Sony ICD B7 also heard the date. The Panasonic RR-US360 
could not hear it. I  will upload a GET-OUT evp that the RR-DR60 only heard 
too. Was recorded same  time as the asking of date.As for "what kind of ears 
I have" :) I do have  pretty good hearing (but have some loss in certain 
areas) maybe my losses are  closer to the static's level and I am helped 
there....I don't know yet. I have  seen enough people (half) that I personally let

no way for me to tell for certain as it is just too feint. I  can't make 
out any clear words. Sure-I could probably matrix some in, but that  is all it 
would be. For an EVP to be considered proof positive of spirit  
communication by the community at large, it has to be clear enough that many  people 
hear the same thing, without hints or coaxing. If you have to have high  
quality devices to make it out, it just isn't good enough. That does not mean  it 
isn't a true EVP, just that it isn't good enough to stand as evidence. As  
for the whistle, it sounded like feedback to me as well, but I will have to  
take you word for it that you were no where near any other electronics or  
EMF's that could contribute to feedback. Even so, if I am trying to remain  
unbiased and objective, there is no way for me to say this is a spirit,  
without personally being with you when you caught it. The only thing I can  
still say about it is could be, but for me it is non conclusive. If someone  
does not hear what you are hearing, try to remain objective and just  
understand that it isn't personal. You have to understand that with just these  
recordings alone, there is no way to scientifically prove what you have  
recorded is spirit communication. If you could get consistent, intelligent  
question and answer recordings, then you would be alot closer. Here again, we  are 
back to the "So what?" thing. You don't HAVE to prove anything  
scientifically, unless you want others to completely believe in your

heard on cell phone without headphones. The conversion to MP3 has  also 
caused some loss, but I am still able to hear them when I review from  this site

I do have some disbelief (shock) that a few of these are not  discernable.

  belief as you.....if EVP's are of the personal nature, no matter if t=
hey yell 
  into the microphone..<WBR>..if you are not the intended receive=
r you will 
  NEVER hear or understand it. I do know my EVP's are very LOW =
audio. I need to 
  work with that and AMP them I guess. In some recordings=
 (1927 is one of them) 
  I can't hear the voice sometimes, that is how low=
 it is. But tonight I 
  finished my comparison recorder evaluations (ran 3=
 recorders that night) my 
  Sony ICD B7 also heard the date. The Panasonic=
 RR-US360 could not hear it. I 
  will upload a GET-OUT evp that the RR-DR6=
0 only heard too. Was recorded same 
  time as the asking of date.As for "w=
hat kind of ears I have" :) I do have 
  pretty good hearing (but have some=
 loss in certain areas) maybe my losses are 
  closer to the static's level=
 and I am helped there....I don't know yet. I have 
  seen enough people (h=
alf) that I personally let hear these....they can't hear 
  them either (so=
me of them) so I understand why others can't hear them. Just to 
  "loop" (=

  I always listen to EVP's with high quality headpho=
nes. In the "tomorrow let 
  you know" EVP, I do hear something...<WBR>.jus=
t can't be sure that it is a 
  voice. I does have a cadence similar to som=
eone speaking, but it could just as 
  easily be something present in the e=
nvironment-<WBR>a natural background 
  noise. There is no way for me to te=
ll for certain as it is just too feint. I 
  can't make out any clear words=
. Sure-I could probably matrix some in, but that 
  is all it would be. For=
 an EVP to be considered proof positive of spirit 
  communication by the c=
ommunity at large, it has to be clear enough that many 
  people hear the s=
ame thing, without hints or coaxing. If you have to have high 
  quality de=
vices to make it out, it just isn't good enough. That does not mean 
  it i=
sn't a true EVP, just that it isn't good enough to stand as evidence. As 
 =
 for the whistle, it sounded like feedback to me as well, but I will have t=
o 
  take you word for it that you were no where near any other electronics=
 or 
  EMF's that could contribute to feedback. Even so, if I am trying to =
remain 
  unbiased and objective, there is no way for me to say this is a s=
pirit, 
  without personally being with you when you caught it. The only th=
ing I can 
  still say about it is could be, but for me it is non conclusiv=
e. If someone 
  does not hear what you are hearing, try to remain objectiv=
e and just 
  understand that it isn't personal. You have to understand tha=
t with just these 
  recordings alone, there is no way to scientifically pr=
ove what you have 
  recorded is spirit communication. If you could get con=
sistent, intelligent 
  question and answer recordings, then you would be a=
lot closer. Here again, we 
  are back to the "So what?" thing. You don't H=
AVE to prove anything 
  scientifically, unless you want others to complete=
ly believe in your evidence. 
  The theory that is being kicked around is t=
hat some EVP's are personal, and 
  only meant for the person recording the=
m to hear. If this is the case, no 
  matter how clear something is to you,=
 ot hers may not hear it. April -----

hear 
  them then it must be either mechanical (sound card or headphones)or=
 maybe your 
  hearing has loss in those frequencies.<WBR>...Some of these =
are not very clear 
  or loud enough too. But many will depend on your comp=
uter sound card & 
  your headphones. I have let an older man listen (i=

  heard most all of the audio. Same with a few=

  right away, and others can't until I loop =
the actually EVP for a few tries. I 
  personally use a Dell Latitude D430 =
to hear these. I can hear some on my cell

  some can be heard on cell =

  also caused some los=

  this site (but I =
have the repetive hearing syndrome in this area no doubt). 
  Although I do=
 have some disbelief (shock) that a few of these are not 
  discernable. Go=
 back and listen to "tomorrow let you know" is in a 
  gruffy-robotic melod=

  And if you could=

  one=
 recorder working here. I would rather hear someone say "I" made the 
  whi=
stle....that would be more understandable. And is very true....if someone 
=
  "tells" the group that THIS is supposed to be what WAS said, then is very=

 to hum

; So my suggestion to you, if you want to get less 
  subjective conjucture=
s or simply less affirmations of your own 
  interpretations, is to post th=
e future ones without labels. The labels you 
  give can influence the list=
eners: when you have a sound that could be several 
  things, and you note =
that it sounded like "keep it moving", the listener can 
  find it nearly i=
mpossible to try NOT to hear what you heard, and so not be 
  able to give =
a fresh perspecive to help your research methods. <BR>> >
