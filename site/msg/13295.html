<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The first test did not go so well participation levels were not so 
good and that may be partaly my fault so I would like to try this 
again .
I have a different file I would like to privatly email to anyone 
willing to listen to it. All you have to do is send me what you hear 
and how clear it was to you.
 
  I dont know if I have ever made mention of this before but my time 
is extremly limited I work Mon-Thurs 6am till 5pm then go to school 
those days 630 till 930pm so fri sat and sun are the only days I have 
to answer emails or read the board. also igo by the screan name 
nightparanormalresearch (obviosly).The name Northern IL Ghost Hunting 
Team is my wife Sarah we are both part of the same nonprofit 
organization here in our home town (N.I.G.H.T). So if iam a little 
busy I may have her answer somthing or post somthing if Iam unable 
otherwise youll always get me first thing friday and sat so if 
someone has a question on a post for me depending on what day it is 
you may have to wait till fri or sat. 
   I just wanted to put that out ther so noone thinks Iam ignoring 
them or not answering emails. 
   Now back to the test I will send out the new file to all those who 
participated in the last one and any one who would also like to 
participate let me know via email nightparanormalresearch@...
and i will gladly send it to you.If you participated on the last one 
but dont want to on this one just ignore the email ill be sending.
 Thank you to all those who have taken the time to listen to the 
first one and I truly apoligize that it was a bust but I think this 
one will be alot better as I have mor time to spend and i wont be 
rushing.</pre>
