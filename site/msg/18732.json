{"id": "18732", "subject": "Re: [EVP-ITC] E.F.P.-has anyone heard of this or tried this piece of equipment?", "author": "Tim Woolworth", "timestamp": "2010-09-19T00:36:59Z", "full_text": "My understanding of this device is that it has a white noise generator that\nyou adjust when your recorder is in record mode while the speaker output is\nplugged into the device.  The idea is to adjust the white noise so that\nthere is no spike on the meter.  This ideally would set the white noise\nlevel as being the same as the room in which you are in and fine tuned to\nthe inherent noise in your recorder.  Once this is done, any noise that goes\nabove this white noise threshold would cause a jump in the LED meter.\n Obviously, during the questioning part of an EVP session, your voice would\nregister on the LED&#39;s as being above the white noise threshold.  The idea is\nto look at the meters when no one is talking to see if you get an EVP.   The\nEVP should also trigger the meters if it is above the noise level of the\nroom.  I looked at buying one of these back in May when they were first made\navailable, but I didn&#39;t think it would be worth the $145 the group was\ncharging for them because any cough, rustle of jackets, or movement would\nalso trigger the LED&#39;s and in a group with more than one person in a\nsession, this could create frustrating false positives.\n\nOn Sat, Sep 18, 2010 at 8:18 PM, Country &lt;plaine@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Greetings Everyone....\n&gt;\n&gt; In search to try all methods or equipment for EVP/ITC, I have come across\n&gt; this piece of equipment at Ebay. Could someone explain in simpler terms what\n&gt; this does and how? Apparently you need your own digital recorder to record\n&gt; anything this picks up.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also I noticed that this the group mentioned who endorses this meter is\n&gt; also the manufacturer.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Thanks for your help,\n&gt; *Country\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The E.F.P. has been tested and is commonly used by the American Paranormal\n&gt; Research Association, proving to be a valuable tool when conducting E.V.P.\n&gt; investigations\n&gt;\n&gt; The E.F.P.&#39;s &quot;real time, high visibility&quot; green with red\n&gt; center LED display, allows others to view E.V.P. responses\n&gt; easily in dark locations. This feature allows users the\n&gt; ability to capture E.V.P. evidence on video. The device\n&gt; has a &quot;white noise/ambient noise baseline adjustment&quot;\n&gt; allowing the user, to set the baseline level on the devices\n&gt; illuminated scale. This provides a &quot;visual reference&quot; to\n&gt; see in real time any &quot;addition&quot; or &quot;reduction&quot; of\n&gt; proprietary frequency noise. The E.F.P.&#39;s built in circuitry\n&gt; amplifies input signals to high levels allowing users to\n&gt; visually monitor E.V.P. responses at higher resolution. The\n&gt; input to the device has (1) 3.5mm stereo plug used to\n&gt; connect to any recording devices live audio output\n&gt; (earphone). The E.F.P. also has (1) 3.5mm audio output\n&gt; which can be used for earphone or mp3 type speakers.\n&gt; The E.F.P. has a &quot;manual on/off switch&quot; and built in &quot;push\n&gt; button single LED navigational light&quot;. The E.F.P. operates\n&gt; on one standard &quot;9volt&quot; battery. The current regulation\n&gt; circuitry in the device provides hours of use.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nMy unde s anding o his de ice is ha i has a whi e noise gene a o ha you adjus when you eco de is in eco d mode while he speake ou pu is plugged in o he de ice.  The idea is o adjus he whi e noise so ha he e is no spike on he me e .  This ideally would se he whi e noise le el as being he same as he oom in which you a e in and ine uned o he inhe en noise in you eco de .  Once his is done, any noise ha goes abo e his whi e noise h eshold would cause a jump in he LED me e .  Ob iously, du ing he ques ioning pa o an EVP session, you oice would egis e on he LED's as being abo e he whi e noise h eshold.  The idea is o look a he me e s when no one is alking o see i you ge an EVP.   The EVP should also igge he me e s i i is abo e he noise le el o he oom.  I looked a buying one o hese back in May when hey we e i s made a ailable, bu I didn' hink i would be wo h he $145 he g oup was cha ging o hem because any cough, us le o jacke s, o mo emen would also igge he LED's and in a g oup wi h mo e han one pe son in a session, his could c ea e us a ing alse posi i es.\nOn Sa , Sep 18, 2010 a 8:18 PM, Coun y plaine@...m> w o e:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n G ee ings E e yone....\nIn sea ch o y all me hods o equipmen o  EVP/ITC, I ha e come ac oss his piece o equipmen a Ebay.
