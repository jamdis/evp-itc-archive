Who are these  \nentities we are talking to and why would it be such a problem for us  \nto know who they were in life? If these are dead humans, it can&#39;t see  \nhow it would make any difference at all. In fact, to me, being able  \nto talk about human things with them is rather the only way to prove  \nthat they are dead humans. It does concern me that these entities are  \nnot human, not because I would particularly care if they were  \nextraterrestrial or extradimentional and just admitted that, but  \nbecause my personal desire is to talk to people like me who have  \ncrossed over.\n\nCan you ask them to give you some sort of reason why they can&#39;t tell  \nyou more about themselves?\n\nWell, my 2 cents. I know that my line of inquiry with the box is  \ngoing to be directed at people who have crossed. Maybe I&#39;ll get some  \nanswers of my own shortly.\n\nAnn\n\n\nOn Dec 5, 2007, at 7:44 PM, bruce halliday wrote:\n\n&gt; Ann,\n&gt;\n&gt; What I get from mike & Lisa when I ask personal questions about  \n&gt; them is a reluctant answer at best.\n&gt; I have already thought to ask all of the questions you mention and  \n&gt; more and have been answered with\n&gt; &quot;NO&quot; &quot;can&#39;t&quot; and things like &quot;Wait&quot; so I&#39;m assuming that they are  \n&gt; either not allowed or are not ready for me to find\n&gt; out about their physical lives. I also get the impression that they  \n&gt; want to remain as separate entities in my mind\n&gt; and if I where to know who and what they where in the physical it  \n&gt; would reduce them to a lower level of spirituality\n&gt; in my mind. that is the general jist of the messages as far as that  \n&gt; subject goes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt; Paranormal Investigating Team\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; From: lisby@...\n&gt; Date: Wed, 5 Dec 2007 19:06:23 -0500\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Comments for Bruce\n&gt;\n&gt; Rambling thoughts:\n&gt;\n&gt; The sound quality was not as good with this batch. Lots more\n&gt; background. Did you change anything?\n&gt;\n&gt; Okay--I am completely fascinated with who these people are who talk\n&gt; to us. I have two, both male, and god knows who they really are,\n&gt; because one has changed identity at least six times over the years,\n&gt; and one won&#39;t tell anything at all about himself. Period. Oh, he says\n&gt; that he won&#39;t talk through the box either. I&#39;m tempted to add, &quot;So\n&gt; there&quot; as a direct quote. LOL. Anyway, Mike and Lisa-- So Mike says\n&gt; he bled to death in &#39;95; Lisa choked to death in the 1920s and nuts\n&gt; to you for asking, apparently. ;)\n&gt;\n&gt; Would you ask them some questions for me?\n&gt;\n&gt; Ask Mike which &#39;95 he died in--1995 or 1895?\n&gt;\n&gt; Ask Lisa what her favorite perfume was.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ask them both more biographical questions, such as where the were\n&gt; born, lived, and died. Their full names. Their spouses&#39; names, kids,\n&gt; etc. I&#39;m a historian/geneologist and I think it would be a blast to\n&gt; look in available records to try to identify them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ask them the year of their birth. If they tell you, there&#39;s a lot of\n&gt; historical questions I love to ask about events within their  \n&gt; lifetimes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Connect and share in new ways with Windows Live.
