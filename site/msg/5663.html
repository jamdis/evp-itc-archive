<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Not really, it has more to do with how we are taught growing up, 
that the paranormal, and death are to be feared. I think we project 
the fears into this work.

&gt; I may draw some flack from this post but I feel this is a very 
important subject. What exactly are you doing when you use a ritual 
or prayer for protection? You are placing limitations on the session. 
What is the point of doing research in ITC if you are not willing to 
deal with all aspects of it? The enemy is not some nasty entity out 
there that wants to cuss and threaten you, it is your fear. All of us 
who have been doing this for any length of time come across, as 
Sumption calls them &quot;paper tigers&quot;. They bark, bark, bark but have no 
real bite! Unchecked fear causes the most damage both psychologically 
and physically. This fear (the lack of control of it) is also the 
reason why people make up these rituals.Regards,Frank R.

&gt; He said threatening things. He threw a shelf off my wall about 
5feet...showed up as shadows in the hallway...talking 
atnight....oppressive tight feeling in my chest if he was 
active...high emfreadings when he was active..&gt; Carol, I guess my 
confusion is over how a ritual works to stop an entity&gt; intent on 
causing harm. I&#x27;m someone who prays and meditates often, but I&gt; 
wonder if bad spirits are capable of disregarding the boundaries we 
set&gt; for them. I do know that when I told my threatening EVPer to go 
back&gt; outside it worked; in fact, I haven&#x27;t been able to record ANY 
EVP in my&gt; house since then. I&#x27;ve never gotten the cursing so many 
people describe.&gt; Besides having a bad mouth, did the Waverly entity 
do other things?&gt;&gt; Robin&gt;&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message -----&gt; From: Carol

RITUAL FILE POSTED&gt;&gt;&gt; Robin...&gt; I never use protection.. .and have 
had a problem with a spirit that came&gt; home with us from Waverly. 
He&#x27;s gone now, with the help of a great&gt; individual. I have evp&#x27;s of 
this entity saying horrible things. I think&gt; I may start using 
protection now...&gt;&gt; Carol B.&gt;&gt; &gt; As someone who has never used a 
protection ritual (even though I&gt; consider&gt; &gt; myself a very spiritual 
person), I&#x27;m not sure I understand what the&gt; ritual&gt; &gt; is intended to 
protect the person invoking it from. I&#x27;m not being a&gt; smart&gt; &gt; ass; 
I&#x27;m simply trying to learn. Can we be hurt physically or&gt; 
psychically&gt; &gt; by certain spirits, or can our experimentation open a 
dark portal&gt; that&#x27;s&gt; &gt; not meant to be opened? My instinct has always 
been that if I don&#x27;t&gt; &gt; acknowledge evil it can have no power over 
me, but perhaps that&#x27;s&gt; &gt; ignorant. I once invited spirits into my 
house from outside and&gt; &gt; immediately recorded a negative EVP while 
heating a cup of coffee in&gt; the&gt; &gt; microwave. I was too ecstatic to 
be frightened by the message, but&gt; since&gt; &gt; then I&#x27;ve wondered what 
kind of spirit would want to say such a thing&gt; to&gt; &gt; me and if I 
should be more cautious in the future. I would love some&gt; &gt; feedback 
on this recording.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Robin&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----

RITUAL FILE POSTED&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Bad idea! In my opinion. You just create 
fear with that crap, and&gt; &gt; fear feeds itself. Once again, you will 
create what you expect to&gt; &gt; get. If you use protection BS, you&#x27;ll 
have convinced yourself that&gt; &gt; there is something to be affraid of, 
and so you will tend to creat a&gt; &gt; thoughtform to fulfill that 
expectation.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --- In&gt; EVP-

protection ritual I use before every&gt; &gt; &gt; session, I have been using 
it for quite a while now and have had no&gt; &gt; &gt; problems with dark 
heads other than the occasional curse word.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend 
that all researchers experienced and new use this or a&gt; &gt; &gt; similar 
protection ritual before every box session if you are not&gt; &gt; &gt; 
already.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hey it&#x27;s better to have it and not need it , than 
need it and not&gt; &gt; have&gt; &gt; &gt; it!&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I will post it in the 
files section in a folder marked&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;protection ritual&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
