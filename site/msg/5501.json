I really don&#39;t see anywh=\r\nere in my post, a stance being made beside my agreeing with Sumption. Since=\r\n you mentioned it, I have a problem with people who consider themselves to =\r\nbe advanced researchers in ITC telling others that there are things you nee=\r\nd protection from in this field. I have seen this fear mongering over the m=\r\nany years I have been involved with my research and the research of colleag=\r\nues and associates and it has never helped anyone. Are there negative entit=\r\nies out there that want to influence you and distract you? Sure there are! =\r\nProbably just as many who want to help you and they have been there since t=\r\nhe beginning of each of our lives.\n\nThe rule of thumb in dealing with those=\r\n negative forces is to not follow their messages. If the message is basical=\r\nly negative then give it no merit and carry on. No ritual needed! Now if yo=\r\nu want credentials I can give you my &quot;paranormal resume&quot; and let the pissin=\r\ng contest begin. All you need to know about me is I know enough to know tha=\r\nt the more I learn and experience the more I realize I have a lot to learn.=\r\n Ego you say, not at all. \n\nBest regards,\n\nFrank R.\n\n\n----- Original Messag=\r\ne ----\nFrom: bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestiga ting@hotmail. com&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@y=\r\nahoogroups .com\nSent: Monday, January 14, 2008 8:29:15 AM\nSubject: [EVP-ITC=\r\n] For Frank R. this is long but I think worth the read\n\n\n\nFrank,\n\nLet me sa=\r\ny at the onset this is not meant as an attack and I will not \nget into a pi=\r\nssing match over it, but I did feel I needed to address \nit.\n\nI promised my=\r\nself that I would not post a response to any one \nperson,only to a subject =\r\nin general, but I will have to break that \npromise on this one.\n\nI think yo=\r\nur response to the ritual protection post was egotistical, \ncareless and un=\r\ninformed. That was the response I would expect from a \nclose minded sceptic=\r\n that had no real experience in this field.\n\nAs a researcher in the paranor=\r\nmal in general you should know that \nthere is a very real and present dange=\r\nr from darker entities, \nespecially in the field of box research that is st=\r\nill in its infancy \nand our knowledge is not advanced enough using this met=\r\nhod to be so \nhap hazard about it.\n\nAll are entitled to their own opinion a=\r\ns far as the way they go about \ntheir own research but to advise that prote=\r\nction from the negative \nmeans nothing and to do it in an open forum where =\r\nthere are \nimpressionable new individuals that are just entering into this =\r\n\nresearch is very careless on your part.\n\nSome researchers here including S=\r\nteve and myself among other have \nrecorded files with messages that tell us=\r\n that the communication \nprocess is being hindered at that time by what we =\r\nrefer to as \n&quot;dark heads&quot; and our spirit contacts actually use that term. t=\r\nhey \nhave also told us when asked why communication was so bad that it was =\r\n\nbeing blocked by negative entities. \n\nI only one of a few that have gotten=\r\n this exact communication. So \nthere is a real threat from negative energy =\r\nor entities.\n\nPlus through research we have found that it is possible for e=\r\nntities \nto travel back and forth between our realms during an open box \nse=\r\nssion. If you listened to numerous files Steve and I have posted \nasking ou=\r\nr friends mike and Lisa on the other side to insure that all \nand any spiri=\r\nts that may have traveled through please go back and \nhave gotten conformat=\r\nion from them every time.\n\nIf it is possible for an entity to travel throug=\r\nh the portal that a \nbox MAY produce then it stands to reason it is possibl=\r\ne that it can \nbe a dark entity.\n\nAs far as fear goes, I agree wholehearted=\r\nly, fear definitely feeds \nthe negative. And that is my point. The protecti=\r\non ritual does not \ncreate a relative tangible barrier, it is simply a meta=\r\nphoric symbol \nof putting your mind in the right place so as not to feed th=\r\nis \nnegative energy.\n\nAnd the protection we receive from our tech/guides on=\r\n the other side \nin my belief is very real, I believe they do actually run =\r\n\ninterference for us as far as negativity goes and the part of the \nritual =\r\nwhere we invoke their help is just a form of respect and \nacknowledgement t=\r\nhat they are constantly watching out for us.\n\nthis being said, Of course ev=\r\neryone will adhere to their own beliefs \nas far as this subject is concerne=\r\nd. I just felt that your response \nwas a little strong and came more from t=\r\nhe attitude that I also \nsuffer from that is to say &quot; negative spirit yeah =\r\nbring it on&quot;\n\nBut that is not a logical thought out approach to an existing=\r\n concern.\nSo make the ritual available for anyone that wants to use it and =\r\nthe \nexperienced information to go with it.\n\nMy most important concern is t=\r\nhe welfare and teaching and eventual \nsuccess of new researcher and this re=\r\nsearch as a whole.\n\nBruce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever miss a thing.
