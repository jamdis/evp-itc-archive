&gt;  Most seem to get the ones that say &quot;shut up&quot; or worse, and I think it&#x27;s just testing to see what you can handle, and where your fear level is. Even the supposed dark guys, or whatever seem pretty harmless.   Good work, I hope it continues to improve!

&gt; Hi All, Thanks to those here on helping me understand How To Do a sweep recording with a radio (AM mostly)! Last night I finally was able to do it correctly as when I carefully listened back with headphones I heard: YOU ARE STONED, FOR . . . YOU (which sounded like Tiny Tim singing it!?), THE FIRST TIME . . . FOR YOU, then on FM, when I asked, &quot;Is anybody here?&quot; I heard: SHUT . . .UP! LOL Probably that one was a &quot;Darkie&quot;! Most of the EVP&#x27;s/voice messages seemed to be OK and not negative = which is good. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing a lot as they tend to go by too fast and my ears are not used to it, yet! I have the time, daily to do the experimental research on this and hope to continue recording &amp; making notes! Tune in, same time, same station (AM) as they used to say! Thanks. =Judy= P.S. I like the sterio idea &amp; smaller boxes!  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; = = = = = (?) = = = = = = = =&gt;     Hiya Frank &amp; All. 8-)  Frankly, I think there&#x27;s some &quot;wise-guys&quot; that like to act up to test us!  The SHUT-UP was kinda funny, I thought, so I switched bands and went back to AM! Last night&#x27;s session, I got:     5 cycles, GOOD LUCK! . . . then I asked, &quot;Anybody want to say anything?&quot; and got: FORGET IT!, OH GOD . . ., FOR THE BIRDS, , , , BIRDS (in) HEAVEN.    Well, so far, so good! Thanks.   =Judy=    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
