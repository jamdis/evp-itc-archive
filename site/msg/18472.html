It sounds like what the Ovilus does.... Who has come up with this PX EMF?
I=
 have an Ovilus, and I am not really sure about it yet.
Still testing it...=
... How much are they asking for this PX EMF ?
Some of this equipment gets =
really expensive......

ject: [EVP-ITC] PX - Has anyone tried this piece of equipment?



Hello Eve=
ryone:

I am wondering if anyone has tried the PX EMF meter for EVP? Below =
is a description of this meter, in case you haven't heard of it. Any though=
ts on this meter?

Thanks,
Country

"""The PX EMF meter is a talking ghost =
box which translate EMF signals into speech. It uses an internal database o=
f 2000+ words or can translate in Phonetic Mode speech which is not in the =
dictionary. It also has a reverse Phonetic mode. My favorite though is the =
Touch Mode. In this mode, if the PX is left alone and someone or something =
touches it, it will start pinging like a deep sea submarine.

1: Dictionary=
 Mode the PX has 2048 internal words that are used in this mode
2: Phonetic=
 Mode the PX will use phonemes to speak
3. Reverse Phonetic Mode The PX wil=
l reverse the phonetic output in effect it talks backwards
4. Touch Mode th=
is mode is used to detect if the device is being touched
5. Voice Change Mo=
de, this mode is the same as #1 dictionary mode except the voice
can be alt=
ered detected inputs
6. Repeat Mode say last words said .. in this mode the=
 PX will repeat the last words spoke from last said to first
up to 400 word=
s.
7. Energy Mode : this mode allows the user to set the sensitivity of the=
 device with one of 3
preset levels. The PX will say LOW then give four bee=
ps pressing mode during this time will set the Energy level low."""
