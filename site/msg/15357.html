Wellll, I didn't realize, this is one that's even h=
ad a litter under the
grounds shed, and one of the guys used to bring it fo=
od and water, so no
wonder it's almost tame. Anyway, profound for me, I usu=
ally scare away
children, women and animals. Hopefully it's not the usual e=
athquake
sign, that would be scary! If you look at the shadow guy image on =
the
group home page, on his hat is wolf image, and this was just before tha=
t
big Afghan quake, plus it was showing up in the shower window--in the
ste=
am. I used to do Native American type stuff, so the totem stuff has
meaning=
 for me. 

Angels and Ghost has a psychic prediction page, and one they had=
 listed,
a soviet plane crash just happened--Russian plane, but not it in R=
ussia,
and another is similar to what I'm getting, a big tsunami for the ea=
st
coast. I can't get the guys to give me a straight answer as to what hits=

in August--if anything.
