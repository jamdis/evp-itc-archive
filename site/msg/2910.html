<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ll post a few more examples from these sessions when I get home from work. I do not know who the speaker is, I do get many technical people speaking however they rarely use a name. Chicago is one of many &#x27;stations&#x27; in their network. In the last year I have heard test messages from Chicago, Madison WI, Hamilton Canada, New York, London and the Yukon. London seems to be the most active for me. As far as the content I believe they are testing a Tesla design or device, the Edison remark at the end caught me off guard. The only historic connection I know of with Tesla and Chicago would have been his fantastic exibit at the Columbian Exposition near the turn of last century.
I believe SoundSoap 2 is available for a Mac, you can google it. The company who makes it is Bias. Keep in mind after reading this, I believe there are many ways the other side can communicate with us, this is just one example.

Dave, first up--I hear that completely clearly. I also hear a voice  
with a distinctive early 20th century American accent. I always  
listen for historic accents that that is absolutely one.

Who do you think the speaker is? What does Chicago have to do with  
the message? How do you personally interpret it?

Tech: Can I use something like this on a Mac system?

Damned curious
