(and perhaps even give\nit time to think about what it would like to phrase)\n\nWith kindness,\nJoel\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; I used the phrase &quot;the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&quot; in Stefan&#39;s\n&gt; evpmaker and have had interesting results including some live. I tried other\n&gt; pangrams (contain every letter of english alphabet) but the one I felt drawn\n&gt; to use was the one that has had the best results.\n&gt;\n&gt; No two sessions are ever alike and as background sound its easily modulated\n&gt; into quite complicated sentences and word structures.\n&gt;\n&gt; Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; inner energy &lt;innergy111@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You know, i was thinking:\n&gt; If you could build a random event generator built on the spoken\n&gt; letters of the alphabet,\n&gt; that would definately be nice and very good."}
