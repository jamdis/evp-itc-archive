I will, I have had this since Monday, and my lady is the one pushing me to go.  I'm a man (maybe a stupid man) and the only reason I would go to the Doctor is if I'm kicking the bucket.  The only furneral I will go to is my own, and I'm not sure if I will even go to that one.lol  I'll be ok, and thanks for the concerns.
   
   I also have acid reflux and it makes me miserable some times.  I take a Zantac and it goes away.  Thats just fine with me.

      How could the breath air, their not supposed to have any lungs?
  Who can tell what they have or don't have.  Hell my chest has been hurting for some reason and if it doesn't get any better I might be talking to you from the other side.  Time to go to the emergency room, but work comes first.
