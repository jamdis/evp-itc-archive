Rick is also the co-builder (along \nwith Ron Ricketts) of The Mini Box, a newly designed &quot;Ghost Box&quot; coming \ninto production very soon.\nThe proto-type Mini Box was recently shown and tested at the Stanley \nHotel in Colorado. On my recent BlogTalkRadio show Rick Moran joined me \nto talk a bit about the Mini Box and to tell the listeners about what \nhappened while the Mini Box was performing at the Stanley Hotel this \npast weekend. This was probably Rick&#39;s first on-air interview since the \ndemonstration at the Stanley Hotel, and it&#39;s a very interesting one.\n\nYou can hear that show and Rick&#39;s interview here:\nhttp://www.blogtalkradio.com/ufogeek"}
