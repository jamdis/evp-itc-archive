Thats great Bruce. Easy for me to hear. Did they capture the essence of her voice? Kinda sounds more like your name than "you" for me but everything else I hear the same. I had one sent to my cellphone I posted those over at esnips. This field is full of nteresting stuff =)

It is the third message I have recieved in this fashion in all the 
years I have been involved in the paranormal.
