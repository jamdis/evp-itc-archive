<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t think it excludes using it as a location device, however. The  
issue is the audience, not the location. If you&#x27;re on location,  
personally experimenting, it seems to function just fine in many cases.

The issue here is not taking a chance in front of an audience. I feel  
more than a bit conflicted about what the answer to that properly is.

&gt; Hi Deb,
&gt;
&gt; Let&#x27;s just say, when any researcher tries to do a public box  
&gt; session for people that
&gt; have not only never heard a box but did not even know what one is  
&gt; until the actual demonstration.
&gt;
&gt; Let&#x27;s just say you will have 99.9% of the people walking away going  
&gt; &quot;what was that, the guy was listening to a scrambled radio
&gt; and asking it questions&quot;
&gt;
&gt; The chances are, even if the audience where familiar with the box  
&gt; and the theory and technical functioning that allows for real time  
&gt; communication
&gt; with spirits. they would not on their first or maybe even their  
&gt; tenth attempt hear any words or responses to questions.
&gt;
&gt; Not to mention, the demonstrator better hope that he or she has  
&gt; somewhat favorable conditions for a successful session.
&gt; It is just not a good practice unless your audience has some  
&gt; knowledge and experience with a box of some type.
&gt;
&gt; Any public session I have heard of left the majority of individuals  
&gt; involved with a sour taste for box research.
&gt; And that includes Staten Island ,Halloween night or so I&#x27;ve been  
&gt; told. by the presenter himself.
&gt;
&gt; That&#x27;s why if you ask the original box inventor he will tell you  
&gt; that his intention was for the box to be a stationary research tool.
&gt; not a location device.

&gt; &gt; Steve,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I listened to the file, It could have said what is labeled.
&gt; &gt; It was kinda rough and I don&#x27;t think anyone but an experienced
&gt; &gt; researcher used to listening to Frank&#x27;s box would hear anything
&gt; &gt; from the random mode especially.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think you may have gotten caught up in the moment, I know those
&gt; group sessions can get exciting.
&gt; &gt; My advice would be to hold off on any public display sessions until
&gt; we refine the communivation to
&gt; &gt; where the average listener is capable of hearing a response. Don&#x27;t
&gt; forget what happened on halloween in staten Island.
&gt; &gt; Or what happened to those knuckle heads at pulse radio.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think it would be detrimental to the research not to go somewhere
&gt; and have a group of people hear nothing but what
&gt; &gt; they discern as noise. for the simple reason that they are not
&gt; equiped to hear the actual responses.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just my opinion as afriend and fellow researcher. also I believe
&gt; our friend Frank believes that the box was not meant
&gt; &gt; for field work and does not perform to the best of it&#x27;s ability in
&gt; a public situation.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have been having weird sessions with Frank&#x27;s Box #27, but in a
&gt; good way. They told me to change the antenna, which it did and the
&gt; random started working and never has on this box. They told me
&gt; tonight to put the old antenna back on and the sessions keep getting
&gt; better and better. I dragged Juli and Joel in on what i believed and
&gt; felt was going to be a great box session and here is a file only a
&gt; couple minutes in to our hour long session. This is a bit rough
&gt; sounding, but hearing it live is pretty clear and you can hear me
&gt; respond and than Joel agrees that he heard it too. My sessions are
&gt; pretty incredible since the random mode started working on the FB#27
&gt; and i feel the random is the best thing out there...hands down. I
&gt; have done Sessions on the internet through Skype all week and i feel
&gt; the energy between Juli and I are really bringing them through
&gt; clearly. I only use FB#27 now in random mode and it is the best
&gt; feature on any box, between the white noise, echo and random there is
&gt; no competetion up to this point. The hacks are good, but nothing is
&gt; better than an original frank&#x27;s box. Our friends on the other side
&gt; told me that they fixed the random mode to go and teach others and i
&gt; am going to a meeting on wednesday to demonstrate the different boxes
&gt; and our friend made a promise to come though if i go....so we will
&gt; see.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here is one of the files i got so far.
