<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Reminds me of the &quot;Radio Luxembourg effect&quot; back in the 30&#x27;s. Radio 
Luxembourg&#x27;s shortwave transmitters were running tremendously high power 
and were being heard superimposed over a Swiss radio station&#x27;s broadcasts, 
even though they were nowhere near the same frequency.

We studied this when I was studying plasma physics in college.

Here&#x27;s a bit of info:
