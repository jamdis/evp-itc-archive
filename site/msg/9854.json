The purple-colored \nshadow ghost drawn into the photo looks like it is floating on top of \nthe photograph; and the light blue anomaly drawn between the fence \nslats is horribly done, also.\n\nYou are right, a good chuckle they are.  :)\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shadow71414&quot; &lt;shadow71414@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In the photo section I have just uploaded a few photos for your \n&gt; review.  I would certainly like your honest opinion, for my own has \n&gt; been reached long ago.  They are photos of what are professed to be \n&gt; paranormal in nature, and given the initial viewing I could not \n&gt; fathom for a minute that these could in fact be taken as serious \ndata \n&gt; and advertised as true spirit photography.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition, I have also listed some articles and background \n&gt; information on this gentleman who proclaims to be highly \nexperienced \n&gt; in the paranormal community, with a long list of degrees under his \n&gt; belt.\n&gt; \n&gt; The dilemma that I am now presented with is the fact that giving \nthe \n&gt; paranormal community is based on a belief system that life after \ndead \n&gt; does in fact exist.  With this false material being presented, we \n&gt; (the paranormal community as a whole) will never be taken \nseriously.  \n&gt; What many paranormal investigators strive for almost seems \n&gt; unreachable, and yet those who continue to display false data are a \n&gt; direct reflection of all us in the community tarnishing our good \n&gt; name.  It&#39;s bad enough that we have do go up against skeptics \n&gt; everyday, but to have self proclaim paranormal experts producing \n&gt; faked evidence, certainly is a disgrace to us all, and should \napology \n&gt; for his dishonesty and misleading those who ever gave him the \nbenefit \n&gt; of the doubt.  \n&gt; \n&gt;     They were my photographs, taken with two different cameras. One \n&gt; was an Olympus Trip AF 50, a kind of instamatic type 35mm, and the \n&gt; other was a Yashica J-7. In all photos where the anomalies were \n&gt; captured, the film type was fuji, ASA 400 color film. The photos \nwere \n&gt; scanned in at 400 dpi. The digital copies were enhanced to show up \n&gt; better o\n&gt; \n&gt; You can pretend you didn&#39;t see the analysis and the\n&gt; accompanying write up, but you would be lying. It was posted on the\n&gt; PP site by the Zoellers as well as passed around in an e-mail to\n&gt; everyone. You also know that the person asked to remain anonymous as\n&gt; he is still active in the service... He also has ten years of\n&gt; experience working for a photographic studio.\n&gt; \n&gt; The photos are an old argument. If you recall, (and let me refresh\n&gt; your memory as you seem to have selective memory since you came over\n&gt; to this group) when I gave the originals to John and said I would no\n&gt; longer respond to any more questions concerning the photos. As I\n&gt; stated then, let john have them analyzed. He could just as easily\n&gt; send them to whomever.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When I went to College there was no degree for Audio Engineering. \nYou \n&gt; specialized in Acoustics and electrical Engineering.\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;     Articles that he supply and that mentions his name and explains \n&gt; what he dose for a living. \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.bssaudio.com/news_view.php?id=50\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://systemscontractor.com/articles/publish/article_590.shtml\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://www.admark.cn/manage/31/200677144117.htm\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://www.aes.org/member/profile.cfm?ID=1435424442\n&gt;  .\n&gt;  \n&gt;  The articles listed below were uncovered by Melanie K. Hale and \nhave \n&gt; come into question regarding the same.  Numbers don&#39;t lie, I guess \n&gt; people do.  Mr. Roundtree seems to think  that it is right to lead \nus \n&gt; to believe he is something he&#39;s not, and that all published \nmaterial \n&gt; is his for the taking. \n&gt;  \n&gt;   So I did a little math and found the actual percentage of \noriginal \n&gt; material in each of David Roundtree&#39;s papers I linked.  I did this \nby \n&gt; opening in word, then selecting &quot;Tools&quot;&gt;&quot;Word Count&quot; and wrote down \n&gt; the total for Words.  Then I deleted all linked materials and did \nthe \n&gt; same &quot;Tools&quot; &gt; &quot;Word Count&quot;.  Then I took the second number and \n&gt; divided it by the first number.  Here are the results linked to the \n&gt; original document on David&#39;s site:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Analog_or_digital. doc  =  38% original material  62% taken from \n&gt; other sources\n&gt;  \n&gt; Biofeedback_ Experiment. doc = 10% original material  90% taken \nfrom \n&gt; other sources\n&gt;  \n&gt; EVP_Project_ Phase_1.doc = 31% original material  69% taken from \n&gt; other sources\n&gt;  \n&gt; EVP_Project_ Phase_2.doc = 43% original material  57% taken from \n&gt; other sources\n&gt;  \n&gt; Orbs-The_Search_ for_the_Truth. doc = 32% original material  68% \n&gt; taken from other sources\n&gt;  \n&gt; The_Magic_that_ is_Light. doc = 0% original material  100%\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Photo in the file section under Dave Rountree\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; David M.
