<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve contacted a spirit twice that claimed to be John Lennon...accent 
and all.  No way to tell if was in fact it was him speaking, but cool 
non-the less.

&gt; Hi All, Finally found some nice speakers: Craig CMA3000, white, that 
fold up w/4 &quot;AA&quot; batteries +plugin that goes into the RS 12-469 
earphone jack. $16.00 at CVS Pharmacy. Works SOoooo much better than 
what I had plugged in! Also, tried a different type of tape; was using 
Maxwell XL II 90, Memorex DB 60, TDK D 90 type I, and now have TDK SA 
90 High Bias type II.  This last one seems to work better. Recorded 
some clear &quot;voices&quot; + one that said, &quot;I love you, MoM!&quot; Don&#x27;t know who 
that was! Hmmm?! Also, tried to contact John Lennon and it seemed as 
though he got annoyed at another entity blocking him, one even 
said, &quot;Take your time.&quot; as I heard him say, &quot;Jam it!!&quot;  I wonder IF 
this is something he said while alive on Earth???  Wild stuff! 8-)
