That woman&#39;s voice came though so nicely. \n\nI tried sitting the box near me without asking questions and as far as I can tell, no one spoke to me. When I ask questions I usually get answers, though. \n\nI wonder if I did it your way more often, if they may start speaking up. It seems when Steve turns on the boxes he builds, they talk to him even though he hasn&#39;t asked anything. But then again, maybe they only do that with people who build the boxes. \n\n~Draiga\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thanks. I don&#39;t do investigations, and usually asking questions does not\n&gt; work for me, so I am not 100% on how much the entities rely on broadcast\n&gt; stations, or if it&#39;s possible to still get voices with no radio stations.\n&gt; Lots of questions that need answers.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
