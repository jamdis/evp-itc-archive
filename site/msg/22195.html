This one still amazes me, I get so many different people talking to  me, I 
just don't have time to answer each one before another one speaks up, even  
my mom, spoke my name a few times, and one fella says,  if you listen  
closely you will hear it at aprox. 3.54 you will hear, "clear it for Ms  
Stebbins" (my mom), and other's statements are caught with aprox. times  too.  There 
were so many responses, I couldn't get them all on here.   Hope you enjoy, 
sf

The question was asked, Is there life after death,  and I got all kinds of 
affirmative answers. At 0.05 sec. "I'm Alive" 0.15 "There  must be" 0.16 
"faith" At: 0.27 "mucho" "yes" 0.31 "Yes" 0.34 "Praise Him" 0.35  "Bonnie" 0.53 
"yes" at 0.53 "you'll see" Then I hear a childs voice at 0.99 say  either, 
"Jacob or wake up" At 1.03 sec. I hear, "has to be" at 1.09 "they'll be"  At 
1.27 "Mc Donald" at 1.44 "hi" at 1.48 "on the floor" at 2.29 "i was hoping" 
 "yep" I asked r u on a lower plain, that's when I hear "yes." At 3.26 I 
hear  name, Howard, powerful then at 3.54 "clear it for Ms Stebbins" at 3.56 I 
hear my  mother's voice call my name"Bonnie" at 4.00 I hear, "they see 
themselves" i had  my cam close to the ghost box, so it made a reflection. At 
4.21 "I"ll say" then  they answer my other question, when I asked them how 
long the line was going  from the low plains of darkness toward the light, they 
say at 4.24 "54 miles, it  is long" then it's long that I get at 4.42 "they 
will come" at 4.52 :what's up?"  "Hi" then I got some names, at 5.10 
"pushing back here" at 5.23 "Walt, Frank,  Herbie" and when I go to close down, I 
got at 5.46 "love you" "love you" at 5.57  "Rick save me a place" They tell 
me that I just got started with the session at,  6.12 At 6.23 I hear my 
mother's voice again, calling out my name, " Bonnie" Upon  closing the session, 
I hear, at 6.46 "we love ya" I had many more responses, too  many to list 
here. Don't tell me there is no life after death, there is, and  there is most 
certainly Jesus, and He has the only door into Heaven  too.
