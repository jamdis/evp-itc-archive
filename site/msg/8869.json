Cut the speed to 87% and uncheck x cross, you don&#39;t \nneed it.\n&gt; only cue should be checked.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When you do a session do not try to listen to all the sounds at the \nsame time\n&gt; Relax and try to let your ear pick out just the relevant stuff, \nthat&#39;s in real time.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When you are going over the recording keep only the words that are \nclear and apparent\n&gt; and clip out the other random junk like the, err eeh aah eer sounds.\n&gt;  \n&gt; You will find that in the seconds preceding a question, once the \ncrap is peeled away the answer or statement is there.\n&gt; Plus Ron, you have had no signal where you are since you started \nand have never had a chance to let your ear and brain become\n&gt; a custom to listening to this type of communication. Give it some \ntime, work with it and most of all, approach it\n&gt; with a positive attitude and a relaxed frame of mind.

I forward this for two reasons:  the first as a request from \nBruce to determine recurring words and second because I wanted to \nhave experienced ears hear my recording for comments.   Regarding the \ntest, this is just 30 secs or so of a 7 minute recording.  Recorded \nat 90% using EVPmaker with xcross.  I was able to hear &quot;art and \narthor&quot; a number of times within the 7 minutes.  This is after \nrequesting no names be spoken.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Regarding my experiences with evpmaker and the allaphone file sent \nby Stefan, I must say my results have been underwhelming.  I hear \nnothing but evp gibberish.  I ask that anyone with an ear for this to \ngive a listen and tell me if you hear anything intelligent.  I am in \na terrible radio zone here in Mexico so I have high hopes on EVP \nmaker and the file Stefan provided.  Also excited about the fact that \nso many others are getting excellent communications.  Thank you to \nanyone who takes the time to listen to and confirm my recordings.  I \nam beginning to feel like I am being blocked out like William had \nthought.  Maybe I am in a true dead zone, no pun intended, or &quot;they&quot; \ndon&#39;t want me in the loop for some reason.

In my opinion the majority of the communication from \nthis method is genuine.The method has produced communication \nincluding my name to me as well as other researchers that have gotten \nmy name, and some of the statements and responses show signs of a \nsense of humor that would surely be absent in random word \ngrouping.Who ever is involved with experimentation of this method, \nwill you please on your next session ask that if there is a spirit \nnamed Arthur for him not to mention his name or the list of words \nthat I have posted. I suggest that this request be made verbally \nbefore the session as well as after.And in the most polite manner. \nThey seem to respond better to formality.please dedicate one session \nno shorter than 2 minutes to this experiment and post your \nresults.Your cooperation appreciated.Bruce\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You rock.
