<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, I made it to the end of the unanswered e-mails, actually probably was 
a blessing that my site got dumped. Got a request from one that was blind, I 
guess I could put on brail labels!? Yet something else to consider. Then 
there was the guy aksing if suicide was ok. That was delicate to answer, but 
I guess I could sell rope too!? Just kidding!!!!=:-{} I told him I didn&#x27;t 
want to give informartion, or opinion to someone just waiting for an excuse.
