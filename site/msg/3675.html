&gt;  . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . ..  . . . . . . . . .      Hi All, I really doubt if it&#x27;s Radio shack that&#x27;s trying to do something here. Why would they want to do anything IF it&#x27;s helping to sell their radios? This would be like If people promoted the fact that SONY&#x27;s Cassette-corder TCM-929, or GE&#x27;s 3-5027 cassette recorder were REALLY good to capture EVP&#x27;s = so what? Anybody can take a manufactured item and then modify it! Agree? =Judy= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

&gt;   This is exactly what I expect is happening. Sum said the site would be down &quot;in the near term,&quot; which made me think he making modifications to be sure that the corporation cannot bother him again.

&gt;     If it is in fact a cease-and-desist notice from Radio Shack, it 
&gt;     wouldn&#x27;t be the first time they (RS) have done this. I receieved a 
&gt;     cease-and-desist notice from Radio Shack many years ago when I was 
&gt;     modifying their radio scanner products and posting them on the web. 
&gt;     Guess what... if you go to scanshack.com you can still see step-by-
&gt;     step instructions on how I modified their scanners, with detailed 
&gt;     drawings I did.
&gt;     They (RS/Tandy at that time) lost that battle with me, or I should 
&gt;     say their lawyer lost that battle with me.
&gt;     But, as you said... we shall wait and see what is up with this issue.

&gt;     &gt; Judy, and everyone else, too--please don&#x27;t promote or continue 
&gt;     this 
&gt;     &gt; until we hear from Sum. This may not be what everyone is assuming 
&gt;     at 
&gt;     &gt; all. My concern is that he has received a cease-and-desist notice 
&gt;     &gt; from Radio Shack, which may have been informed that someone was 
&gt;     &gt; promoting their product in a way not in compliment with their 
&gt;     &gt; corporate image, and that his counsel is advising he comply with 
&gt;     it. 
&gt;     &gt; What you are telling people to do may be exactly what his own 
&gt;     legal 
&gt;     &gt; counsel is advising against and may put him in a precarious 
&gt;     situation.
&gt;     &gt; 
&gt;     &gt; Please just calm down and don&#x27;t make assumption until he can 
&gt;     clarify 
&gt;     &gt; for us. If it comes down to someone making personal threats 
&gt;     against 
&gt;     &gt; him, that&#x27;s a whole other matter. But he needs to ask for help 
&gt;     before 
&gt;     &gt; everyone goes all posse, OK?
