<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t know what to tell you, Juli. The first repeat is the raw  
audio. The second is slightly slowed and the third is more slowed.  
Nothing else has been done. I posted a section of raw audio at your  
request.

I am using a minibox, not a hack. The minibox plugs directly into an  
Olympus DM-10 recorder--so direct audio from the box goes there  
without any ability by me to change it. The minbox also has a jack  
for an external microphone. I use a broadcast quality microphone--not  
a cheap one. That also feeds into the Olympus, which records in stereo.

The file is taken off the Olympus and opened in TwistedWave, a Mac- 
based sound editing suite. The only use are cutting, pasting,  
slowing, and occasionally amplifying and converting from stereo to  
mono. I can silence tracks, but I haven&#x27;t been doing that since the  
first couple session back before xmas. There is no noise reduction  
feature in this suite, so obviously I am not using it.

I know that my files sounds much different from some others on this  
list, but I can&#x27;t help that. This is what I am getting and I&#x27;m  
honestly trying to report that. I am a journalist, so I do try to  
live up my profession&#x27;s ethics.

&gt; So why does it sound so slow and robotic?  The second clip was  
&gt; perfect.  You could hear everything and was very clear.  If its not  
&gt; the editing software is it the signal from the session?  Just curious?

&gt; The first repetition of the clip *is* the raw audio. Not speeded up  
&gt; or slowed. As it was recorded. No amplifying, no noise reduction.  
&gt; That is exactly how it came across. The second rep is 25 percent  
&gt; slowed and the 3rd is 50 percent slowed.
&gt;
&gt; What you&#x27;re hearing is exactly what happened.

&gt;&gt; Ann,
&gt;&gt;                 I heard box in there somewhere.  What do the files  
&gt;&gt; sound like raw?  I think by slowing them down your losing the  
&gt;&gt; clear responses.  Can you post one of the raw clips?  Don&#x27;t worry  
&gt;&gt; about slowing it down or editing it.  I think your getting some  
&gt;&gt; great stuff, but its distored by the editing software.
