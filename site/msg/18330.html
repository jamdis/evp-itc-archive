<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>FYI, i have tried it on numerous occations and had wonderful results. Fact of the matter remains there is to much possibilty and chance with a box. As far as you second question goes, why are you so quick to dismiss science and its methods of proving something without a doubt exsists?

&gt; lol..why are people so quick to dismiss things they can&#x27;t understand or afraid 
&gt; of. I have a strange feeling this person have tryed it didn&#x27;t work for them so 
&gt; then so of course it can&#x27;t possible work for someone else because they can&#x27;t do 
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; here&#x27;s a idea open your mind...leave the judging and fear behind

&gt; I don&#x27;t think Ghost Box research wants anything to do with Science, i wish they 
&gt; would just leave us alone. Don&#x27;t they have anything better to do?
&gt; 
&gt; Scientists remind me of the guys on the side of the road. One guy is working and 
&gt; the rest are hanging out drinking coffee telling the guy what to do......Hey, 
&gt; that&#x27;s a great analogy !!!

&gt; &gt; Is this not a scientific feild? Especially a young one? From read these emails 
&gt; &gt;it seems all this is, is a lot of he/she said crap. The matter remains 
&gt; &gt;(regardless of beliefs) these boxes hold no concrete proof of paranormal. Just 
&gt; &gt;because one or two things happen doesnt make it indefinetly perfect. I mean i 
&gt; &gt;have faith in them but science teaches us to go over things with a fine tooth 
&gt; &gt;comb and you cant with these. That is the point, regardless of beliefs minimal 
&gt; &gt;evidence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Have an idea, we will go to bat for you and Frank, Steve, don&#x27;t be afraid, at 
&gt; &gt;least talk to an attorney, they won&#x27;t charge you a thing at least for a first 
&gt; &gt;consultation, let them know, you and Frank have witnesses, this will damage your 
&gt; &gt;reps. Curtis is right this could hang on the net for many years what they said, 
&gt; &gt;I have sites from years ago, for my paralegal business from 10 years ago, i have 
&gt; &gt;no idea how to even take the thing down anymore, I would go for it, Steve, don&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt;even talk to them, the lawyer will tell you not to have any conversation with 
&gt; &gt;those people, otherwise it could jeopardize when you go to court. sf

&gt; &gt; &gt; Â  Also, if you listen to that podcast you will hear some very specific 
&gt; &gt;protocols that these science minded folks display. Like giggling like school 
&gt; &gt;girls while attacking a person that neither of them know. And, my favorite in 
&gt; &gt;the show:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dr Rorke calling me a douce bag at around 20 minutes in. This is who is 
&gt; &gt;representing the field of scientific research.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That&#x27;s the rub, a cure for cancer would put many thousands out of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work--there will be no cure, too much $$$ in research and toxic 
&gt; &gt;treatments
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that kill more than the desease. Science in this county is a joke! You 
&gt; &gt;can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fund a study to verify whatever results you are willing to pay for.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Been thinking and decided that we are not wrong in our beliefs. If 
&gt; &gt;we can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; help find a missing child as so many do with $30 shack hacks, than 
&gt; &gt;where is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the harm and the threat.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Science spends billions of dollars each and every year to find a 
&gt; &gt;cure for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cancer with no results. I&#x27;m talking about a $30 radio that may help 
&gt; &gt;and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has. Seems like we have the upper hand in the matter. Just because 
&gt; &gt;our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods are not accepted as the norm, does that mean that it serves 
&gt; &gt;no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purp.s..
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If society spent billions of dollars on ghost box research every 
&gt; &gt;year, we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn&#x27;t even be having a conversation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p.s.---- Modern science has found a cure for cancer, they just 
&gt; &gt;can&#x27;t reveal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it because they are making a fortune off of treatments.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p.s.s.----Thanx RJ for p.s.ing that link for that show.....Why are 
&gt; &gt;you here
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyway?
