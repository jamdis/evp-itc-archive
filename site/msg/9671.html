Misty, can you please remove Nathan's access to this site. I just spent the last several minutes deleting these e-mails that have nothing to do with our mission and research purposes of this site.
   
  Not sure about the rest of the members, but this guy is interfering with our work and correspondence, and you have given him every chance to shape up and respect our wishes.

THIS IS NOT COMING FROM ME, BUT FROM THE INVENTOR OF THE SPIRICOM 
George W. Meek, HE STATES THAT TWO EXPERIMENTERS WITH THE SPIRICOM
BECAME POSSESSED AND ONE COMMITTED SUICIDE. 

HE GAVE A PRAYER TO USE BEFORE STARTING TO EXPERIMENT. HERE IS A LINK

> Hi guys !!!I hope Bruce does not mind me posting this.I had
questions whether my RS is working or not,so, I consulted with
Bruce.He asked me a few questions on my set up and to send a test
session. So, I let the session run on its own and sent him the raw
file.Well, sure enough, it is working just fine. I had some static and
learned to move the radio around to a better spot.But amazingly one of
the messages was " I want to see Bruce !"You can hear it clear as day.
Also, I got some vulgar messages and I wonder about this. When Debbie
did a session with me in the beginning she got some eye opening
messages for me. One was "cut the bull ----". Debbie said that can't
be !!! but it was right on !!! we were trying to contact my mom and
that was one of her favorite sayings here !!! LOLHowever, the messages
Bruce recovered in my session were a little more vulgar and not
something from my mom.I also had events in the house after starting
recording sessions.The RS box would go on by itself, not while I was
home, and I live alone. This happened several times, the third time I
came home my computerized clothes dryer locked it's control panel, the
RS was on and my wireless router needed to be reset. I now need help
with Audacity or sound booth. I don't know how to use it to clean the
background noise up.Thanks again Bruce (I hope you don't mind my
posting !!??)Holly
