I am not out to make character judgements here, and I may be\nignorant of issues in the past between folks, so I am only qualified\nto deal with personal experiences in my short time here. I have been\neager to accept the help of all folks here and in other forums. I have\nreceived tons of help and am very grateful to all involved to keep\nthis fascinating field moving forward.\n\nThanks,\nAndy"}
