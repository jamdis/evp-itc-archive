Hey Frank, glad you&#x27;re back! I&#x27;m very interested in your project, and look forward to your updates. I was in the Denver area last month. The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park was the site of a conference hosted by DarknessRadio.com Had I known you were in the area, I would have tried to contact you. Keep in touch and Happy Holidays - Bill Murphy
