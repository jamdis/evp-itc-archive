I was just wondering because of The Big Circle group, and \nhow they often say the words &quot;Big Circle&quot; or &quot;Circle&quot; to identify themselves.  I too have \ngotten messages with &quot;Seven&quot; in it, but sometimes is hard to tell because I also get a lot \nwith the word &quot;Heaven&quot; in it.  And LOL, for a while I had a &quot;Kevin&quot; coming through, which \nwas REALLY throwing me for a loop!  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Margaret,\n&gt;  \n&gt; For a while all of the researchers here where getting numerous messages and answers\n&gt; in reference to the words circle or circles, and the number seven.\n&gt; It continued for a while sporadically and then stoped around the time the confusion with \nthe techs started.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There are quite a few theories and schools of thought on the meaning of &quot;circles&quot; or \n&quot;seven&quot; in message content.\n&gt; They have been thrown around and discussed often here over the last year.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I&#39;ll try to find a couple of my files pertaining to these words and send them to you.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: ITCdeadpeople@...: Mon, 7 Apr 2008 22:40:44 +0000Subject: [EVP-\nITC] Re: New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Kristin.
