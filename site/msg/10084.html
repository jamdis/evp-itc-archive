I heard Mike loud and clear but can hardly hear you.  What is your recording setup like?
   
  For me, since I dont have a working digi recorder right now, I use the mic on my headphones and just set it on my desk with the 470 facing it and i crank the mic volume almost all the way up....it took me a while to get it where I could hear both me and the radio when I played my recording back.
   
  Anyways...good job gal =)
