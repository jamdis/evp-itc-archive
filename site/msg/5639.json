This is \nreally not uncommon, for it seems I have some spirits who like to visit \nevery now and again.  I decided to ask some questions during my session \nwhy this spirit was here and if in fact the tec&#39;s could bring him home \nor send &quot;Collectors&quot; to cross them into the light.\n\nThe questions and responses are posted in the file &quot;Earth Bound \nSpirits&quot;.  Some of the the files may be long in lenght, but I wanted \nyou to hear the conversation back and forth where several spirits are \ntalking and responding all together.  \n\nSteve H. had a previous experience and had an opportunity to assist in \ncrossing a so called Earth Bound Spirit over.  If in fact this is \nactually possible, this could be huge regarding our research as well as \nservice an additional purpose behind our gifts to communicate.\n\nThanks!\nJuli"}
