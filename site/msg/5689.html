Robin,
 
It's never a good idea to invite any spirits into your home.
Some=
 demonic spirits have to be invited in before they can 
enter, there are in=
stinces where people have heard knocks on thier
front door only to answer t=
he door and have no one there.
The knocking by an entity and the opening by=
 the physical being 
symbolises the request to come in and the invitation o=
f the open door.
 
If you give out a ready made invitation, it could be lik=
e that annoying
relative that comes to visit and never leaves.
 
So be very=
 careful whenever summoning any unknown entities.
 
If you need help with y=
our box research or have any questions
don't hesitate.
 
Bruce

Robin, In the evp file you posted I bel=

u hear. Robin, I am glad to hear that the protection ritual will be utilize=
d by you in the purpose it was intended. To give any individual that wants =
to anopportunity to use it. You will find many forms of interaction on this=
 group, running the gamut from total agreement to calm debate /discussion. =
To full blown arguments.  That is what makes a group, If everyone followed =
one single ideology and the ideas of any single person without questionit w=

his community. Bruce

I'm still giving this topic a l=

r of positivity, and the power of ritual.  When I first started recording E=
VP a couple of years ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when=
 it happened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or distressed.  I w=
ill ask again:  What physical or psychic harm is a disembodied entity capab=

ll me what, if anything, you hear.  I know what I hear, and I consider it d=
istinctly threatening; yet, this is the response that has created the deter=
mination in me to continue researching the unknown.  
 
Bruce, I am in awe =
of your recordings.  I only want to learn as much as I can from you and the=
 other dedicated researchers on this board.  It never occurred to me to use=
 a protection ritual in the past, and that's about all I can say.  I will p=
robably use one from this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to a=
ttract goodness.  
 
So, thank you for this contribution.  I think the deba=

lightened.

 [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate


I swore I would not get wraped u=
p in this debateBUT!The reason I came up with this whole protection ritual =
was that some of the new researchers whereexpressing a rational concern for=
 negative responces that they were recieving through thier boxes.The short =
protection ritual that I posted is not meant to quell irrational histerical=
 fear, and I agreewith rosemary that anyone suffering from such fear should=
 rethink thier involment in the paranormal research field.that being said, =
It was only meant as a source of subliminal comfort to those new individual=
s that had never expperienced spiritual negativity. And to help ease them i=
nto aproaching a session eventually with confidenceand determination as wel=
l as full curiousity for all types of the communication we recieve.My initi=
al post of the ritual file was done with the best of intentions and meant t=
o be another tool available for those who felt they needed or wanted to emp=
loy it. it is a simple innocent prayer ritual, I don't think it is really w=
orthy of all this debate.Use it, don't use it. It's there if you want it. A=
lso I must say there are two kinds of fear the kind that is natural and a g=
od given emotion for self preservation, ie the fright and flight reflex tha=
t is an instinctive trait in all of us. Then you have the irrational dibili=
tating phobic fear that can turn an individual into a frozen statue. That t=
ype of fear I believe is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt with an=
d learned how to harness. I also believe that anyone that harbors that type=
 of fear would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a case of such =
fear it would already be present and doing a small protection ritual would =
not fuel it any further. So lets take it for what it is, something to utili=
ze in our box of tools like an emf meter.you may have an old rusty odd size=
d wrench at the bottom of your tool box at home that you inherited from you=
r grandfather and have never usedbut if you come across that odd nut that n=
eeds tightening somedsy you will be glad you have it.Bruce
