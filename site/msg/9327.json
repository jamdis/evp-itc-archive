I&#39;ve also noticed varying sweep times between AM & FM on other \nmodels.  Not sure if the actual rate of sweep differs, for just the amount of channels there is \nto be swept on one band versus another, so it takes longer to complete one full cycle.\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I went ahead and opened up my 12-820 RS radio and clipped the mute \n&gt; wire it is set up simular to the old 12-470 with wires instead of \n&gt; pins. It sweeps both bands fine. Is there any certain rate the band \n&gt; should be sweeping. I noticed that the FM band sweeps faster then the \n&gt; AM band.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kay\n&gt;"}
