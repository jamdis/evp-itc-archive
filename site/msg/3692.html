<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have read about tone generators myself but that seems to be almost 
a step backward.  Wasn&#x27;t spiricom in essence a oscillioscope/tone 
generator?  I know it was considered for a while to be the most 
successful, but it was very electronic or synthetic in sound and 
required quite an operational budget and space.

I think with your invention we have reached the cusp of being able to 
create the walkman of EVP/ITC - we&#x27;re almost there.  And with the 
discovery of the Radioshack mod and the experience we and others have 
had since your box first debuted I think we&#x27;re almost to the point 
where it will be very inexpensive to make a reliable box and/or 
something that the average person could make following instructions.

Of course the holy grail is something that reliably generates clear 
voices every time with little or no white noise.  I know I read that 
someone was trying to create a device that did that, created the 
white noise and then cancelled it out, hopefully leaving you with 
just the voice.

Oh, and a reliable television ITC device would be quite the find 
too.  I plan on creating a RS mod box that will be self contained and 
portable...and my thought was if it works reliably I wonder if I 
could integrate a simply video ITC generator into it as well.  It 
would be great to be able to capture both audio and video.

Anyways, carry on Frank.  I know you&#x27;re doing good work.  IF you 
search the internet for EVP and especially ghost box recordings your 
name is constantly popping up in the recordings, so I&#x27;m guessing 
those communicating with us are quite happy with you.

How does it feel to be the first known living person to be a 
celebrity on the other side, lol?

&gt; Yeah, I do seem to get answers to question with my Ghostman box 
(one of a kind Mini box). the Ghostman is a combinatin of the linear 
sweep and an AM/FM radio with direct out put, no sound chamber  or 
mics. I have kinda palyed wiht white noise, but not for about six 
years. There&#x27;s some ideas about using tone generators instead of 
radio.

&gt; 
&gt; Not really new to the group, been lurking for a few months just 
reading, listening, and studying.Unfortunately I&#x27;m not much of an 
engineer so I&#x27;ve been picking up books to help me better understand 
the technical side of the boxes. I understand the practicality of 
them (ie- creating random white noise to allow EVPs to be formed) but 
I hope to gain an understanding of how they work technically in hopes 
of building and tweaking my own.For me EVP has been something I&#x27;ve 
been into all my life without knowing what it was (I&#x27;m 30 now, I 
first learned the technical term about 22 or 23) - I guess I&#x27;m what 
people would call &quot;sensitive&quot; or whatever. But besides that, early on 
I was fascinated by seemingly coherant sounds that would come out of 
random noise on my clock radio in my bedroom as a kid, from what 
sounded like voices (thought I was crazy for a while) to even morse 
code - for a long time one of my radios would produce random clicks 
or pops even when the speaker was off. My dad jokingly suggested it 
was morse code, so I studied morse code and discovered that at least 
some of it could be morse letters...usually they would spell one word 
and then gibberish.Anyways, once I learned what EVP was I began 
messing around with recorders etc. My first clear recording came from 
using EVP maker and was someone saying &quot;we have been waiting for 
you.&quot; A few days later, after a frustrating lack of communication 
they just told me &quot;build a box.(this happened to be after I learned 
of frank.)&quot; I&#x27;ve been looking at all the boxes and their positives 
and negatives and this is what I&#x27;m seeing:Franks models seem to 
produce the most consistant results but also seem to be less two way 
than some others (ie Joe&#x27;s Box.) Joe&#x27;s Box and the new radio shack 
mod seem to have some very clear voices coming through but skeptics 
can argue that all you are hearing is snippets from radio 
broadcasts.My thought for a cost-effective, low-tech alternative is 
to combine the two in that you create a radio shack mod like the 
UFOGeek one (multiple radios, a mixer, etc) and run it through an 
echo box.Personally I believe that analog is giving the best results 
overall, and I think it has to do with ease of manipulating the 
signal. Therefore my thought is taking a digital white noise signal 
like that produced by the radio shack mods and then essentially 
broadcasting it into the echo chamber and having a mic pick it up 
gives you the analog aspect.My question is has anyone tried this? And 
I was hoping for thoughts on the pros and cons of using AM vs. FM or 
both.Oh, one other thing- any programmers/engineers out there? 
Someone that could write code to allow us to randomly band scan a 
digital radio?
