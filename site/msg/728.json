The frame is 1/4 inch poplar from Lowes, \nthe foil in the heavy duty aluminum foil, and it is glued on with contact \ncement. You can see the mic and speaker mounted opposite each other on wood \nsides. The sides are 1/8&quot; plywood expoxied into the frame. It gives a solid \nmounting panel for the mic and speaker, and can be card board, as well. I \ntry to avoid plasitc, as it seems to be &quot;contra-ghost voice&quot; if that makes \nany sense.\n\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet in the mood for Valentine&#39;s Day.
