<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think for good research, any analysis should be as honest as
possible, whether it confirms theories and expectations, or whether it
doesn&#x27;t. To only receive comments that confirm a theory, and not
accept any to the contrary, I think does a disservice to the research,
and to the researcher.  It can mean repeating mistakes, or continuing
down an unfruitful path, rather than switching strategies when needed.
 That&#x27;s how progress is made.  If Edison kept testing the first
filament he ever tried, and never tried new ones, we&#x27;d probably still
be in the dark.  He tried an approach, rejected it, tried a new one,
rejected it, and kept going, until he found one that worked, under
objective analysis, for everyone.

I hope my comments do not come across as &#x27;negative&#x27;, in a bad way. 
They are just what my own analysis indicates.  I think the best
approach at analysis in this field is to invite many people from many
fields, solicit all their input, and be ready to move forward, or
change tactics, depending on what that analysis suggests. 

And of course, my comment is just that: my comment.  Just one person&#x27;s
comment. I am skeptical of claims made in which I cannot see or hear
the professed results, but am not denying anything outright, without
doing the best analysis and using the best judgment that I can muster.
 And again, I think that is what good research requires.  To only
accept &#x27;positive&#x27; comments would remove this activity far from good
research, and leave it, at best, more in the realm of a social club.

So I do intend to keep on as I have: reading, learning, analyzing, and
hopefully giving posts that add, one way or the other, to the accuracy
and progress of the discussion.

&gt; You definately got something there . . . great job!� I think before
anyone else makes any negative comments they need to be aware of how
the boxes work . . . It takes a trained ear at times to dissect the
audio.� Good catch!!

&gt; Attention, any researchers in the Boulder area. I got this message
tonight using a Radio Shack hack on FM recorded through an optical
(flame) microphone.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;We&#x27;re going out to Boulder...Don&#x27; t leave us Bernie&#x27;s here&quot;
