I don't know as there are "hundreds" of examples available to the public in the way of Luminator photographs, but there are a couple of dozen in Macy's book, "Spirit Faces," and yes, many many of them are open to wide interpretation, just as our humble recordings are.  In addition to that majority that make us say, "Come on!{" there are a handful that make you say "Hmmmmmmm. . . ." Just like we offer a handful of results from our endless recording efforts to try to convince the hard-nosed.
  I would think that many would see the Luminator efforts as a modern effort at scrying.  Everything we do crosses boundaries, and my point is that it's really hard to walk the line between trying to be scientific and trying to be open.  It's really, really hard! But if we give in one area, we have to be willing to give in another.

classic long exposure when compared with other known long exposures-- 
I've included just of hundreds of examples.
