<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am posting two short sessions for hopefully others to comment on.  
This is completed with a RS 469 going directly into my handheld digital 
recorder.  Coincidentally, I am outside in a light rain so maybe it is 
ideal for me here in Mexico where I get few signals.

At first I thought I heard the word BUENO (hello in Spanish) but I now 
hear DINO with is my wife&#x27;s name...short for Dinorah.  She is normally 
not with me for sessions and was not with me for this session so I 
doubt what I am hearing.  Any comments would be appreciated.  

The other recording I hear the name HELEN.  I don&#x27;t know anyone with 
that name.  Ron L</pre>
