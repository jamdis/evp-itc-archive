I&#39;m Ray from Yorkshire England,\n&gt; I&#39;ve been doing research into EVP for a while now and always on the\n&gt; lookout for improved techniques and better results. Just uploaded my\n&gt; first file under Ray&#39;s File&#39;s. I obtained this EVP while exploring a\n&gt; disused Lead Mine here in Yorkshire I was alone and armed with a torch\n&gt; and Olympus VN-120pc digital voice recorder. If you loop the file you\n&gt; can hear the noise of dripping water from the roof of the Mine and a\n&gt; distinct voice saying &quot;help Me&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Ray\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nHI Ray--I hink I' e ei he been o you si e, o somehow un ac oss his EVP be o e.
