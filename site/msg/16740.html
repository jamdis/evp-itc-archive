<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi April,

I did some serious processing on this. I managed to get rid of most of the
low frequency rumble and high-pitched background noise and left just the
male voice frequency band.

It comes through as either &quot;The best for the weather&quot; or &quot;The best for the
level.&quot; After listening to it about 50 times I think &quot;The best for the
level&quot; is a better statement. What it means, who knows?

&gt; Yeah...it is a whole lot of fun!!! 1 little EVP can make all the hours and
&gt; hours of sitting, watching and waiting well worth it. Would love to hear
&gt; what you got too.

&gt;&gt; Hi April,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll give a listen when I get home in a few hours.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I was involved in an investigation on Saturday night of an old house in
&gt;&gt; Shelbyville, IL. It&#x27;s one of the oldest houses in that town, built shortly
&gt;&gt; after the CIvil War, and has a history of deaths in the house. I recorded
&gt;&gt; about 6 hours of audio.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So far I&#x27;ve found 3 EVP&#x27;s. The first one plainly says &quot;Welcome&quot; to
&gt;&gt; everyone who has listened to it so far. The second is fairly clear to me but
&gt;&gt; most of the other members who were on the investigation can&#x27;t hear it. A
&gt;&gt; third one sounds clear to me and to others but MIGHT be a stomach growl.
&gt;&gt; Isn&#x27;t this fun?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Zack

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi All,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; This was captured during a Ghost Hunt last weekend at Golden Hill
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cemetery in Lakewood, CO. You will hear my daughter ask a question, and then
&gt;&gt;&gt; there seems to be a response.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Please let me know if if you can hear it, and if so, what you think it
&gt;&gt;&gt; might be saying.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks!
&gt;&gt;&gt; April
