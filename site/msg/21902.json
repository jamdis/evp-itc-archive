Sorta, I have added\ntone to a couple boxes. Spiricom transmitted 13 tones that supposedly make\nup human speech. Well if you use square waves, they contain all\nharmoincs, so you only need on tone generator, and since I had a spare op\namp channel in #111, I added a tone generator to it. In the video I was\ntweaking the tone and yo can hear a voice at bout 9 seconds &quot;right there&quot;,\nguessing that&#39;s between 600 and 800 hz. The idea behind the tone is to\nsupply a foundation sound &quot;they&quot; can use for voices. I wouldn&#39;t try tones\nonly, too damn hard to listen to.\n\n F-S\n\nSomeone on acebook asked i I e e ied Spi icom. So a, I ha e added one o a couple boxes.
