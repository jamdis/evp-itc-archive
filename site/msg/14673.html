Yes.=A0 Also faulty wiring, which is even more dangerous.
Also with flakey =
transformers or other power distribution in the area, or power lines.
Perha=
ps you can check with some neighbors, and see how their power is doing.

Hi All,
=A0
Is there someone here that can answer=
 and 
electrical question for me?
=A0
During the case that I recorded those=
 
possible EVP's-there was a loud tapping noise that seemed to come from th=
e 2nd 
bedroom. Upon checking my logs, every time one of=A0 these clicks we=
re heard, 
there would be an EMF spike in the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom i=
s upstairs, the 
livingroom downstairs. The home owners have also reported =
that they have a touch 
lamp that comes on all the time by itself and the l=
ights in the Kitchen will dim 
occasionally.
=A0
Now these taps are not con=
sistent in timing, 
loudness or rhythm. Could this be the work of faulty br=
eakers?
=A0
Thanks!
April
