&gt; I think we should all focus at the research at hand and forget what
&gt; everyone else is doing. I personally know Chris and think he&#x27;s a
&gt; great guy and frank feels the same way most days. This has gotten
&gt; to the point where i can&#x27;t even do a session anymore because i&#x27;m so
&gt; blocked by negative thoughts from this group it&#x27;s pointless to
&gt; concentrate on the box and get results. Honestly who cares what
&gt; chris does anyway, does it really affect everyone&#x27;s lives that
&gt; much. I have a job and this is a hobby that i used to really like,
&gt; but now this board has brought me down. It seems all people want to
&gt; do is make this like a street fight with challenges and negative
&gt; views and for what reason? If anyone is concerned about hearing
&gt; Chris&#x27;s audio, i have about 2 hours of box sessions from Eastern
&gt; State on my web site for all to listen to. It&#x27;s
&gt; www.keyportparanormal.com and go to investigation and click on
&gt; eastern state. All the audio is at the bottom of that page and you
&gt; guys can judge for yourself and i heard a lot come out of that box
&gt; that night personally because i repeated a lot of stuff back to
&gt; chris that i heard. Enough already, let&#x27;s move on to the next great
&gt; thing. That radio shack hack was a great breakthrough here, let&#x27;s
&gt; just be happy we got that before it was shut down. Now we have
&gt; another avenue to go down, but we can&#x27;t do it with all these
&gt; negatives out there. Let&#x27;s move on to new topics and anyone out
&gt; there that bought a Radio Shack box, start sharing your files with
&gt; the group so it&#x27;s not just us same 5 that post all the time.
