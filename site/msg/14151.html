Last night I got the most wonderful EVP RT, but I don't know how to cut and 
 paste the thing, if anyone wants to call me I will play for you, my mom in 
her  own voice calls out my name, it sounds she is far away and calling out 
to  me.  There are also other voice's, one man says name of Mort or Morton 
I  think, another guy says "horse" it's so cool, I could hardly get to sleep 
last  night.  I will try to send this whole tape, it's 10.4 mb as I said 
before I  don't know how to cut it into pieces to put into the group files.  
Here it  is as an attachment file, I called my daughter in OK and she heard 
her  too.
