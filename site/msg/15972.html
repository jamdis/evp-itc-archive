So Frank, are you going to sell kits for the DIYer for the new boards with parts and schematic?

Catch up from a trip sucks! I got more parts ordered along with printed circuit boards. Soooo, might be able to produce something a bit more professional looking. I'd like to make two versions, TRF, and hetrodyne, but it's going to take a while to get it all together. 

I tried recording on the boat with a shack hack, the 470, but only got he usual doomsville junk I get everywhere. FM was the only mode cuz the metal ship hull shileds out all AM signals unless you hand the box out a port hole. Even FM was spotty. 

Shermer's talk/presentation was interresting!
