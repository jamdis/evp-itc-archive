<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Richard, and welcome to the group. I am not on here much as I
usually just read the posts and contribute when I can. I am very busy
with my group so balancing my time isn&#x27;t easy.

I guess as of now it is hard to say whether or not an EVP is from a
&quot;living&quot; entity or just a sound bit floating in time. All we can do is
speculate on such matters, really. I think that time may lead to
finite answers to our questions, but as it stands with our limited
equipment and devices we use to measure phenomenon, we cannot say 100%
for certain. I have my theories, as does everyone.

That being said, my personal belief is that EVP and ITC can be both.
Though my research has been much more focused on EVP and recently, on
the Radio Shack hack box, I have seen what I believe to be evidence of
both. I have many EVPs recorded that seem to suggest both &quot;living&quot;
entities and those that suggest residual phenomenon, or &quot;residue&quot; of
things in the past.

One example is the EVP I captured at the Camp Creek Trustle in
McDonough, GA. In the EVP, the voice picked up seems to suggest that
he is not dead. Tou can check this file out in my folder here. Also,
at the investigation of the trustle, EVPs were picked up seeming to
answer questions. For example, when I asked what kind of music was
enjoyed by the entity, I received &quot;orcha&quot; as an response. I took this
to be an attempt to say &quot;orchestra,&quot; a popular music choice from the
early 1900&#x27;s when so many lives were lost at this spot. As for the
Radio Shack hack, just last night I was again at the trustle
conducting a hack box session. When we asked about which of us were in
attendance, the answer came back very clearly with two of our names,
&quot;Nate&quot; and &quot;Chad.&quot; These were very clear and in an area where radio
reception is not that great.

Perhaps one of our more compelling EVPs as they relate to whether or
not these are &quot;living&quot; entities we are communicating with is one that
we recorded in the White House located in McDonough, GA. A team member
was talking about someone and how poorly they kept up their yard when
we picked up a very clear voice saying &quot;You are so mean.&quot; On the same
investigation we captured a voice talking about Kurt, another
investigator and how he was stupid.

Now to the other side of the coin. We have picked up &quot;EVPs&quot; of things
such as gunshots and cannon fire at civil war battlefields we have
visited. These appear at first to be residual sounds, yet other
aspects of the investigation seem to provide proof of intelligent
entities. Perhaps the soldiers who died in that battle are still
fighting. We cannot really say based on only the EVPs taken during
those investigations. We do have other evidence, but I will not go
into that here as this is an EVP/ITC group.

Feel free to take a look at our group&#x27;s site.

I am happy to send our files to anyone for research purposes if requested.

I am sure that many of the members of the group will give you their
theories as well on this matter, and I&#x27;m sure that as you begin to
experiment on your own that many fascinating and unexplained events
will present themselves to you. Good luck, and again, welcome to the
group.
