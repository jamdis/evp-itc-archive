For one person=\r\n to say he is the &quot;primary tester&quot; is inaccurate, he was the first that kin=\r\nda understood how it was supposed to be used, or so I thought. I think we l=\r\neft the &quot;treting phase&quot; some time ago, perhaps it&#39;s time to return barrowed=\r\n equipment?  I wasn&#39;t quite finished with that e-mail-- I hit the send butt=\r\non in my rush to get off to work.     I put out a box use guideline thing a=\r\n year or two ago stating that no one has the right to take my equipment and=\r\n and claim their use supercedes anyones else&#39;s use, or results. So, to cont=\r\niue...  As a far as &quot;technicians&quot; I don&#39;t get any of that stuff, but---they=\r\n do talk about a network, and connection to our equipment. When I first mad=\r\ne my &quot;Ghostman&quot; box, last week, it wasn&#39;t working well, but a day or so lat=\r\ner, it came to life, and one of the voices said it had been connected to &quot;t=\r\nhe network&quot;. Supposedly there is a similar connection made to computers run=\r\nning EVPmaker. I&#39;m not sure if these &quot;network&quot; connections are maintained i=\r\nf equipment is taken out for investigations, or demostrations. Of cousre, I=\r\n can&#39;t say if these networks are a fact. I would think as maker of the box,=\r\n these etheric techs might want to give me, or others some hints.  As far a=\r\ns the ghost box, or Frank&#39;s box, being a &quot;telephone to the dead&quot;, I think i=\r\ns very poor analogy, the old style phone system of Edison&#39;s day had operato=\r\nrs, plural, not one person that recieved all calls, then interpreted what w=\r\nas being said to other parties. That&#39;s more of a master control schema.The =\r\nold phone system didn&#39;t charge you an arm and a leg to talk to someone in t=\r\nhe same room either! Some might say these &quot;Technicains&quot; are the operators, =\r\nbut even if anyone esle could hear these voices, why do you need someone to=\r\n interpret what&#39;s being said. I say if not many can hear it, or something s=\r\nimilar, it ain&#39;t real! There is a certain kind of conatct, ion that that yo=\r\nur own mind uses the noise as a sort of psychic prop, you hear the stuff in=\r\n your head, it may be accurate and real inforamntiion, but no one else is g=\r\noing to hear it. i think that what all this supposed converstions wiht Edis=\r\non maybe.  I have in fact heard a voice that said &quot;Edison here&quot; but there w=\r\nas no other real information conveyed that I could understand.  As for port=\r\nals, demons and evil spirits entering the world through these &quot;unauthorized=\r\n&quot; boxes, I an only say, as the original mker of the box, I have gotten voic=\r\nes cuzzing, swearing, name calling, and even threatening, but nothing that =\r\nhas seemingly &quot;entered&quot; our world. Even those &quot;threatening entities&quot;, when =\r\npressed to bring it, fold up like paper tigers. These beings and spirits al=\r\nready exist all around us, and at a higher level, so they have full access =\r\nto this, a lower lever. Besides. There is that &quot;network&quot; that seem to allow=\r\n for better contacts, and kinda helps highter being to come through.   I ma=\r\nde these &quot;boxes&quot;! The idea was not &quot;Edisons Telephone...&quot; What I got was an=\r\n assemblage of my own expereince and knowlegde, put together by my own mind=\r\n as answer to my question of what else could I use for spirit comuncation. =\r\nAll technology involved was based on what I had worked on in the past for r=\r\nadio experimentation. I had in fact, a couple years before my interest in E=\r\nVP, been experimenting with voltage tunable radio modules removed from car =\r\nstereos for AM DX, that&#39;s listening to distant AM radio stations. I was hop=\r\ning to find other talk shows similar to Art Bell, and there used to be one =\r\nout of Cincinati(?). The idea of using a random voltage to tune the radio w=\r\nas after using EVPmaker, which uses a method of generating random speech bi=\r\nts for the entities to use. It was a small leap to apply the random techniq=\r\nue to an anolog system. I am not the first to be focusing on a problem, and=\r\n have the mind provide an solution in complete form. Nothing mystical about=\r\n it. The fact is, after much work, and experimenting, the tuning doesn&#39;t ha=\r\nve to be random, a linear tuning works much better. Yet another fact of  th=\r\ne box, covienently ignored.  What really chaps my hide, as maker of the box=\r\n, is to have someone, who knows nothing of electronics, and technology comp=\r\nletely ignore everything I say about the box, and presume to tell me how it=\r\n really works, how it should be used, and what is acceptable from it. This =\r\nguy is so honest, he won&#39;t even use his real name, but huff and puff at at =\r\nanyone that contradicts his use of my equipment. I say, as &quot;a Tester&quot; if yo=\r\nu can&#39;t use it in an honest manor, bring the stuff back--testing over! Like=\r\n it or not, the public has this technology, you can keep pissing and moanin=\r\ng, trying to spread fear, or you could choose the way of Light.
