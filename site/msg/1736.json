I thought i was alone \nwith this.  When i first started i had asked for a sign that i was \nactually speaking to someone and my ceiling fan stopped for a few \nseconds and than started again.  The next day it wouldn&#39;t work at \nall, so i pulled the switch out of the wall and it was completely \nfried.  I luckily had a spare and re-installed it and it works fine \nagain, but lesson was learned from that.  Don&#39;t ask for a sign b \necause you never know what they will do, and that goes for with or \nwithout a box.  They do listen and will pull energy from anywhere \nthey can to achieve it.  I think that explains the appliances going \nout, i will ask a question and right before they answer something in \nthe house will flicker or go out.  Sometimes they say &quot;I did that&quot; \nto take credit for shutting something off.  It&#39;s all about energy \nand how we use it in life and in death.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I never paid much attention as to which boxes produced more \nnegatives, but I \n&gt; used to get alot when I first started this stuff. I tend to ignore \nthose, \n&gt; and sometimes if it&#39;s in a segment I copy to the computer I&#39;ll \nplay it \n&gt; backward. Reversed, sometimes the evil voices are angelic.  That&#39;s \ncurious \n&gt; about it shutting off aplliances, I thought those ran on internal \nbatteries. \n&gt; Maybe you&#39;re getting a lesson in energies?\n&gt; \n&gt; I did get a quake warning in last nights test, it said  China \nsuffers a \n&gt; quake, followed by August 11. I usually don&#39;t get dates, or \nlocations, so I \n&gt; guess wait any see, of maybe they can evacuate China? Often, when \na quake is \n&gt; coming I get a wolf image, well there&#39;s a wolf face on the shower \nwindow, \n&gt; kind of a medium size wolf, so I think if there is a quake it \nwon&#39;t be real \n&gt; severe, maybe like a 6 or 7. Wolves for quakes, cats for wind, and \nbears for \n&gt; tsunamis, which I didn&#39;t know ahead of time. For Katrina I had a \ncat(image) \n&gt; with huge round eyes.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Good Box...Bad Box\n&gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 30 Jul 2007 00:42:01 -0000\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Does anybody think it&#39;s possible to get 2 extreme opposites in\n&gt; &gt;communication?  1 Box curses at me constantly and tells me to die \nand\n&gt; &gt;also talks about the end of the world and hell.  And the other one\n&gt; &gt;talks about how pretty it is there and i always get &quot;Hi&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt;Here&quot; as well as &quot;Don&#39;t leave&quot; when i&#39;m signing off and an\n&gt; &gt;occasional &quot;Goodbye&quot;.  Has anyone experienced anything like this\n&gt; &gt;before?  The 1 box even shuts off appliances in my house when i \nuse\n&gt; &gt;it, i guess i&#39;ll stop using that one for now until i figure out a\n&gt; &gt;solution to what&#39;s going on.  Any ideas?????\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;-Steve H.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; http://imagine-windowslive.com/hotmail/?locale=en-\nus&ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_mini_2G_0507\n&gt;"}
