&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Ralph here again. Seems every time I come back on to leave a message
&gt; there&#x27;s some bickering going on. I can&#x27;t leave you people for a minute
&gt; without some hoopla going on LOL (just Kidding). Well how ya&#x27;ll doing ?

There seemed to be something happening all around over the last few days 
or week.  It wasn&#x27;t just here.  I am on 62 Yahoogroups and almost all of 
them broke out in arguing and bickering at the same time. I have NEVER 
seen that happen! And one of my favorite area bands had some really 
bizarre and unpleasant things happen at a show on Saturday night. And we 
had three earthquakes here. Some thought all of these events were caused 
by the full moon.  I dunno, it was still very odd but seems to have passed 
now. Lives are retue=rning to normal.

&gt; Fine I hope. I have been busy with my Paranormal Group and
&gt; investigations and Gettysburg. I was in Gettysburg over this past
&gt; weekend and got an EVP in the Triagular Field that said &quot; Never trust
&gt; Abe Lincoln &quot; LOL must have been a Rebel soldier. I thought that was
&gt; pretty cool.

It also could&#x27;ve been a Union soldier who didn&#x27;t like his outcome!

I really want to get the chance to visit Gettysburg.  I am pretty sure 
Batleground, Indiana (the site of the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811) is 
haunted by some of the former soldiers.  I&#x27;ve been to that one many times 
but never tried to get any EVP there.
