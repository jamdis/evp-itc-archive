You can read about the software at the following link:

<http://download.intel.com/technology=
/itj/q42001/pdf/Audio%20Software%20\
for%20the%20Intel%20Play%20Computer%20=
Sound%20Morpher.pdf>

It was designed to go along with a sound capture devi=
ce that Intel was
selling.  It has a good number of options, all which are =
not detailed in
the 11 page brochure linked.

RJ... I've provided the files=
, 36 in all, (raw and processed), I've
explained what I did in the videos, =
and that is where it stands.  I can
read between the lines of most of your =
posts as your words very clearly
reflect your intent to not accept anything=
 unless it is done by your
methods, which you haven''t even discovered yet.=
   That's your choice
and your option.

Bottom line:  I did what I did... I=
 shared what I did... I stand by what
I did. Some will believe what was don=
e, others will not.  I will not
attempt to provide continual explanations, =
because I am not attempting
to sway any opinion.  It's just a ITC research =
project I did... plain
and simple.

You've got the original files... experi=
ment away...
