I don't think you can really say they "give off sound": they can cause soun=
d, and maybe that's what you meant by a secondary phenomenon.=A0 But, gravi=
ty can cause sound also as a secondary phenomenon (if it pulls an apple off=
 a tree and its hits your head), and far infrared EM radiation can cause so=
und as a secondary phenomenon (if it heats something to burning or boiling)=
, and microwave frequencies can cause sound as a secondary phenomenon (as w=
hen popcorn pops).=A0 So about anything can cause sound as a secondary phen=
omenon.

              April, standard physics today defines four

 fundamental types of forces: electromagnetism, gravity,=A0 
              =

ff sound": they can cause sound, and maybe that's what you meant by a secon=
dary phenomenon.  But, gravity can cause sound also as a secondary phe=
nomenon (if it pulls an apple off a tree and its hits your head), and far i=
nfrared EM radiation can cause sound as a secondary phenomenon (if it heats=
 something to burning or boiling), and microwave frequencies can cause soun=
d as a secondary phenomenon (as when popcorn pops).  So about anything=
 can cause sound as a secondary phenomenon.<br><br><br><br>--- On <b>Mon, 6=
