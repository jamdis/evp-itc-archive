The initial tones are software generated. The software is called &#39;Audio Mulch&#39;. The function to use is called &#39;10 Harmonics&#39;. I use a base frequency of 102hz. The waveform must be adjusted so the peaks are flat across the envelope, you will see what I mean when using the software, there is a free trial version of the software. The information on the SEC LED driver is available on Dr Stifflers web site. I do not have a link as the site pages seem to change frequently.\n\nHere is another example from the system\n&quot;I&#39;m glad your talking...and also watching&quot;\n\nThanks for your interest,\nDave\n\n--- yahoogroups@... wrote:\n\nFrom: Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt;\nTo: RetroCom &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Optical Spiricom Captures\nDate: Sat, 15 Mar 2008 13:45:53 +0100\n\nHi Dave,\n\nwhat exactly did you do to get this original, monotonous &quot;Spiricom\nsound&quot;? When I use Audition to mix the 13 tones, I get a sound like in\nthe attached file &quot;13sine.wav&quot;. Did you also use a ring modulator?\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; A couple captures from tonights session with the optical based Spiricom.\n\n&gt; One the first one I get a Spirit who always pronounces my last name incorrectly.\n\n&gt; &quot;Murwinski likes the future&quot;\n\n&gt; The second capture is not robotic like the first.\n&gt; &quot;Pray at the end of the world&quot;\n\n&gt; Dave\n\n\r\n----__Part.20080315145831.A0BE9A0C\r\nContent-Type: image/gif; name=&quot;opticalspiricom.gif&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;opticalspiricom.gif&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__Part.20080315145831.A0BE9A0C\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;031008imgladyourtalkingandalsowatching.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;031008imgladyourtalkingandalsowatching.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__Part.20080315145831.A0BE9A0C--"}
