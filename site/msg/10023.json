He&#39;s the same guy that came up \n&gt; with the RS hack. His approach is he just wants more data.\n\nLogging the allophones while they are played sounds like an interesting\nidea, and as an alternative to actual speech-to-text it can help to\nverify what is heard. It&#39;s similar to what I had played with and\ndescribed in my yesterday&#39;s e-mail:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/message/9877\n\nThe guy you mentioned isn&#39;t perhaps Rob Fitzgerald\n(www.DeadScience.com)? He had constructed a SpeakJet box, coupled to an\nEMF antenna.\n\nStefan"}
