<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It just takes a little time if you understand the basics.  All the 
different devices have their own nuances and peculiarities, advantages and 
disadvantages. AVR&#x27;s run faster than PIC&#x27;s due to architecture, and the 
code in an AVR for a given routine is generally 3/4 to 2/3 the size of a 
PIC program to do the same thing.

The AVR users&#x27; slogan, BTW, is &quot;Come over to the dark side.&quot;

&gt; I downloaded a PIC tutorial, but it takes time for old dogs to learn the new stuff.

&gt; Frank,
&gt;
&gt; It can all be done on a single chip. I&#x27;ll work on a proto next week when I get time.

&gt; Thanks, right now it&#x27;s just an idea to try to find a solution of no or few radio stations in remote areas, such as the Stanley in Colorado. I could still use the white noise transistor, and schmitt trggers to convert pulse to random number, the feed a 1 of 10 counter or something. I&#x27;m kinda behind on digital. I have a PIC chip keyer, but bought it already programmed.   As wth all of this stuff, I couldn&#x27;t care less who actually does it.  Frank-S

&gt; I wrote the code for a pseudo-random number generator using a PIC some years ago. I&#x27;ll see if I can dig it up.ZackOn Wed, 28 Nov 2007, Frank Sumption wrote:&gt;&gt; Now all we need is a pic chip to output random numbers which can be used to turn on and off switches that allow fixed tones through to a mixer/amplifier---Instant Spiricom! I&#x27;m thinking use op amp square wave generators, and switch them in and out using something like the old 4066 chips. The goal being to have a system that works without the presence of radio stations, such as remote investigations, and eliminate the concern that we&#x27;re just creating the messages in our minds trying make sense out of random voice fragments.&gt;&gt; Frank-S&gt;
