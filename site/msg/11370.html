<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I will, thank you! 

Now all I have to do is find a period of time that&#x27;s quiet and 
private (hard to do with two boys ages 8 and 5 home from school all 
day) I&#x27;m looking forward to trying it out. I will post back with 
progress and results. 

Thanks!

&gt; Hi Angela
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome to the group =) Sounds like you have everything you need to 
get started. My answer would be yes you pretty much have everything 
which is the recording device and the software on your pc to analyze 
your files. 
&gt; 
&gt; As for why some files are fine and others are not I find that when 
a file doesnt play directly its easier to just download it and play 
it in audacity or whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; Give it a try and see what ya get.

&gt; &gt; Hi everyone, 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My name is Angela, I am 30 years old, married mother of
&gt; &gt; two. Been 
&gt; &gt; interested in the paranormal for as long as I can remember.
&gt; &gt; Was 
&gt; &gt; recently in an investigation group but the leader was a
&gt; &gt; very pushy, 
&gt; &gt; obnoxious individual that basically scared everyone off.
&gt; &gt; Anyway...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was listening to some of the files. Nice work! However
&gt; &gt; some of them 
&gt; &gt; won&#x27;t open, when I try to open some of them I get a
&gt; &gt; message that 
&gt; &gt; says &quot;Windows Media Player cannot find the file&quot;
&gt; &gt; or cannot open the 
&gt; &gt; file something like that...anyone know why some files play
&gt; &gt; and others 
&gt; &gt; won&#x27;t? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also...I am interested in capturing EVPs myself. However I
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t have 
&gt; &gt; much equipment. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a computer of course, and a pair of stereo quality
&gt; &gt; headphones 
&gt; &gt; with microphone attached (like the kind a call center would
&gt; &gt; use) My 
&gt; &gt; computer is right next to our air conditioner so that could
&gt; &gt; provide 
&gt; &gt; the &quot;white noise&quot; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Could I possibly record with nothing more than a headphone
&gt; &gt; mouthpiece 
&gt; &gt; and a freeware program like Audacity? Or do I need
&gt; &gt; something more 
&gt; &gt; extensive? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also are there any risks of doing EVP in one&#x27;s home? I
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t suspect 
&gt; &gt; paranormal activity here but I read Tom and Lisa
&gt; &gt; Butler&#x27;s book &quot;There 
&gt; &gt; is No Death and There are No Dead&quot; where they talk
&gt; &gt; about making 
&gt; &gt; contact with &quot;The Other Side&quot; even in locations
&gt; &gt; that are 
&gt; &gt; not &quot;haunted&quot; such as one&#x27;s home. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions, tips, advice, input would be greatly
&gt; &gt; appreciated!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks! 
&gt; &gt; Angela
