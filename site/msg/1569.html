<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I thought I heard them say that the 13th was special yesterday, but it 
wasn&#x27;t very clear, that&#x27;s why I wanted to do a session today. so once again 
I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the change in echo box, or conditions.

&gt;           These are from using a larger echo box wiht #13, not the one I 
&gt;was making
&gt;tonight, this box is made out of wood, I made it last year. The voices are
&gt;copied off the tape as I back up(rewind) the tape, and kind of &quot;feel&quot; where
&gt;to stop and copy segments to the computer. A &quot;trick&quot; I find more useful 
&gt;that
&gt;going form front to back.
