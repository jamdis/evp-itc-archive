The two\nShack Hack&#39;s sold for a combined $260. Darkness Radio raised over\n$17,000 on this event that was donated to a Los Angeles battered\nwoman&#39;s shelter. The organizers have raised a healthy six figures for\nvarious charities around the country. It&#39;s always with representatives\nfrom the recipient organization present and the checks and cash is\npublicly counted and turned over to the representatives. \n\nThe people that attend these events are always eager to learn about FB\nand the other Boxes. The difference between this event and other\npublic demonstrations of the Box is that no one at the Darkness\nevent&#39;s wants to personally profit from ITC. I explained how to hack\nthe 469&#39;s and the folks who bought them during the auction knew these\nwere originally $24 radios but choose to help the auction while\ngetting a Shack Hack. Later on both nights a group gathered to\nexchange ideas and listen and try to interpret for themselves what was\ncoming out of the Boxes.\n\n-Bill"}
