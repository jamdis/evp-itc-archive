I found the RS arm ban=\r\nd radio works the best, the 469 is a POS, mess with it too much and it quit=\r\ns working. I have one with bad AM, and another with&nbsp;F&#39;d-Up FM. I found=\r\n this Sony at the thrift store of $6.99, don&#39;t know if it&#39;s usable yet, but=\r\n it&#39;s better than $35 for the RS. Anoither Honda radio, this one is only a =\r\nmaybe at this point. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;Techno question; I see people making ban=\r\nks of RS 12-469s, and I can only&nbsp;ask&nbsp;why!?&nbsp; Some seem to hav=\r\ne the technical expertise to build the sweep circuit, why not just make a s=\r\nimple box that&#39;s proven to work? I wouldn&#39;t use that multi-radio set up, it=\r\n&#39;d be impossible to understand anything from it.&nbsp; It would seem more c=\r\nost effective to start wit something that works. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;The 12-470 c=\r\nan use an external sweep voltage, but you have to locate the converter stag=\r\ne that turns the digital pulses into a voltge the varactor can use. It take=\r\ns the 8 volts (max) for AM, but FM is weird, it tunes form +4 to 8 volts. I=\r\n have newer car tuners like this as well. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;Frank\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;=\r\n\n\n\n\nInstantly invite friends from Facebook and other social networks to joi=\r\nn you on Windows Live=99 Messenger.
