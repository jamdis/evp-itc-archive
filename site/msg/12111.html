<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Welcome to the group. Yes it seems pretty normal that it works that way. It&#x27;s always good to record to catch what you may miss hearing yourself. Glad its going well for you!

&gt; Within the last week I came across the concept of the ghost
&gt; box 
&gt; (Frank&#x27;s box) and have had immediate results.
&gt; 
&gt; This is actually using a mobile phone on radio mode with a
&gt; manual scan, 
&gt; simply holding down the button and it scans through the FM
&gt; bands either 
&gt; up or down. There was no white noise being played at the
&gt; same time nor 
&gt; on review.
&gt; 
&gt; What surprised me was the clarity of the answers to direct
&gt; questions 
&gt; which could then be checked on a reviewing the tape. But
&gt; also that on 
&gt; one ocassion the replies weren&#x27;t audible until the
&gt; replay of the taped 
&gt; session was heard.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this typical?
&gt; 
&gt; I can upload the sessions which are quite interesting due
&gt; to the 
&gt; subject being discussed.</pre>
