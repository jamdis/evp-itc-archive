I will check the tape before the experiment to insure that there are 
no EVP&#x27;s on the recorded session.

I will have numerous digital recording devices in the room recording 
the session as the taped session is playing. We will be far away 
from the building but not out of eye sight.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;       I know I do not post much here, so let me start.  Going 
along these lines of thought, if you are recording the questions 
onto an audio tape and leaving 20 seconds of silence between them, 
you are still recording you and possibly your thoughts as well as 
any spirits that might be around you or your recording environment 
at that time.  So how do you know that what you listen back on is 
from the location you placed the recorder in and not from the 
location you recorded the questions in or from your own creation?  
Just something to think about.

&gt;             I am not sure this would still rule it out.  I don&#x27;t 
think psychokinesis is restrained by walls, the mind isn&#x27;t 
restrained by walls whether human or deceased.  I am guessing that 
psychokinesis behaves similar to telepathy....
&gt;    
&gt;   I believe many evp&#x27;s are deceased spirits, but the question on 
whether it could be a living person imprinting the evps was 
certainly one that made me really think !

&gt;           Hi James,
&gt; 
&gt; Back when I still investigated haunted sites, our team did this on 
various occasions within a house where we recorded several hours of 
activity over a few years (a long term investigation). We would 
leave our audio equipment recording in several &quot;hot spots&quot; all over 
the house and then leave for an hour or two. I have to say, in our 
experience we never got an EVP while we were out of the house. As a 
matter of fact we had an EVP when we reentered the house 
saying, &quot;here they come, lets go&quot;. I don&#x27;t necessarily understand 
why a ghost or spirit would talk with no one present to receive the 
message unless during setup you explained what you are trying to 
accomplish and what the spirits roll is in the experiment (we never 
tried explaining). A piece of machinery (recorders) in an empty room 
does not have a consciousness or spiritual presence I would be 
interested to see if you get different results.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Frank

&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] EVP Experiment planned in October.
&gt; 
&gt;     To try and rule out that the EVP researchers are imprinting 
voices 
&gt; psychokinetically on audio players mistaken as ghosts voices, I 
will 
&gt; pre-tape an interactive evp session.
&gt; 
&gt; I will record a bank of thirty questions, 20 seconds of silence 
&gt; after each question, on a cassete tape and played on a cassette 
&gt; player that will be utilized in all three buildings in a known 
&gt; haunted location just outside of Phoenix, Arizona.
&gt; 
&gt; There will be digital recorders, cassette recorders, omni 
&gt; directional microphones, condensor microphones, as well as an 
&gt; electrocet boom microphone present in all of the sessions. There 
&gt; will be no human agents in the buildings when these sessions take 
&gt; place.
&gt; 
&gt; My hope is to:
&gt; 
&gt; Record an authentic EVP with no human agent in the building. 
&gt; 
&gt; If this is phenomena driven, will the phenomena communicate by 
&gt; responding to questions from a machine rather than a human agent? 
&gt; 
&gt; If you have any ideas to enhance this experiment, please feel free 
&gt; to let me know. This experiment will take place on October 27th.
