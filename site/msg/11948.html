<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s all heresay. I never experienced a spiritual hierarchy on the  
other side when I was there. Over there, where I was, there was no  
such thing as ego - only love.

Not everything dear Edgar stated was fact or true. Many predictions he  
made never came to fruition. So again, I wouldn&#x27;t take that as proof,  
but just someone&#x27;s opinion.
