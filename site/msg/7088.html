I haven't developed an ear for this yet, but what I'm hearing is "It's 
up to us, then" and then a lot of stuff I can't make out.

I know this is kind of like learning to understand someone with a heavy 
foreign accent - the message is there but I just have to get used to the 
variation from everyday speech..  How long does it usually seem to take 
people before they get the hang of it?
