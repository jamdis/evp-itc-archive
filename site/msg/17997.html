I hear you. Different people make different claims about where the 'informa=
tion' comes from.=C2=A0 This experiment doesn't discriminate: any and all p=
ossibilities are fine.=C2=A0 I can only set up the experiment, and report o=
n the results.=C2=A0 If the results show correct answers coming from spirit=
s, or aliens, or=C2=A0 as a focal point for a person's own abillities, it's=
 all the same to me.=C2=A0=C2=A0 I just want to help explore what works and=
 what doesn't.
