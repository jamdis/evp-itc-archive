<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Also wanted to add, after the Japan earthquake happened, two people on my Facebook admitted they had been having &quot;wall of water&quot; and earthquake dreams.  You never know whose predictions are accurate and whose aren&#x27;t and when, but when you get several people coming together predicting similar things that should be a warning... the psychic prediction registry website makes that possible.

&gt; I found this video posted on www.prophecies.us
&gt; Regular Joes and Janes post their  predictions there.  I&#x27;ve followed this site a year and a half now, and they&#x27;ve had some predictions that came true.  If you&#x27;re into predictions, I highly recommend this site.
