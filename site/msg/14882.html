I think that the only positive I could see out of manual sweep is that you =
will have a natural irregularness to the speed at which you sweep.

Correct=
 me if I am wrong, but I don't think that manual sweeping means you search =
for words necessarily. I mean the aim should be the same as automatic sweep=
 in that you just turn the knob back and forth without reason.

        I'm not sure I understand the theory behind the manual sweeps - =
maybe you can help?

        I thought the idea behind the electronic (fran=
ks box) sweeps is that the entities are the ones selecting the proper frequ=
encies at the proper time containing the relevant words they want to expres=
s.  Is that true?

        If so, then doesn't the manual sweep completely =
override that process, since it is you that is turning the knob, and just l=
ooking for words you personally think are relevant?

                With the RS hacks they are basically just opening=
 the case carefully and cutting the mute wire or pulling out the mute pin d=
epending which radio it is. Check the archives for descriptions for each mo=
del. RS updated some versions of the radios so they were no longer able to =
be modified. Steve Hultay went on to try it on a few other radios and got s=
ome good results. 

                You can also do a manual sweep with a r=
adio that has a knob/dial or a scan function that doesnt jump the stations =
too quickly by simply scanning across the band. This method works great.
