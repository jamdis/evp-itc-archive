<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks I got into the Wiki, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to want to let me
create an account to view the discussion.I&#x27;ll see if I can wort that
out, but meanwhile...

Here&#x27;s what I found on their Wiki on what they are calling
&quot;Opportunistic EVP&quot;:

&quot;This category of EVP is relatively new and much less understood as
compared to transform EVP. Opportunistic EVP devices usually have
additional electronic stages which are different than what is found in
the basic recorder technique using just an audio recorder and sound
source. It therefore has additional ways in which an EVP might be
formed. There are many variations on the theme represented by radio
sweep and EVPMaker.

As is illustrated in Figure 5, radio sweep involves rapidly scanning
available Amplitude Modulation (AM) radio stations to create a single
stream of sound fragments. The sound fragments are then used as an
input to a recording device. In some applications, a speaker is also
attached to the output of the sweep stage in an attempt to achieve
real-time communication. Although it is possible to simply turn the
tuner on a radio with a recorder microphone nearby, there are a number
of “boxes” designed by inventors, such as the MiniBox[5] and Frank’s
Box.[6] From our observations, these are all variations of essentially
the same theme with different mechanizing techniques.

The software program, EVPMaker developed by Stefan Bion[7]is also
opportunistic in that a single stream of conversation is chopped into
small bits and then reassembled into a second stream of sound made by
concatenating bits based on a random number process. Bion’s research
has shown that message formation is caused by manipulation of the
random number process.

These techniques are called “Opportunistic EVP” because it appears
that the EVP is formed by selecting available sound bits to form a
word or sound that closely matches the intended utterance. This is
different from changing sound to match the required output.

Figure 6 illustrates what is being referred to as Mistaken,
Opportunistic EVP. As in transform EVP, mistaken EVP in radio sweep
and EVPMaker result from the assigning of meaning where there is none
intended. Because the resulting stream of sound bits does have voice,
it is easy for the mind to assign meaning to word-like sounds, even
though none was intended or a second listener might hear something
very different. The meaning is not caused by a communicating entity,
but is from the tendency of the mind to find meaning in otherwise
random sounds [4].

Figure 7 illustrates how the analog stage might be used to induce a
transform EVP into a radio sweep or EVPMaker circuit. Transform EVP in
this circuit will tend to be interrupted by the sound bits from the
radio sweep, causing an effect similar to an experimenter talking over
an utterance in the basic recorder technique. EVPMaker is not as
likely to produce a transform EVP because all of the processing is in
the digital format and the output is usually the only analog stage.

Opportunistic EVP Summary

EVP may be formed in the sound stream resulting from the fragmentation
of a mundane source, either pre-recorded conversation in EVPMaker or
multiple radio stations in radio sweep. The resulting sound stream
might also be mistaken as EVP when there is none, but transform EVP
might be formed in the device. In concept, all of the opportunistic
EVP devices depend on the sound frequency, amplitude and inflection to
be present in the raw source at the time it is required for voice
formation.&quot;

&gt; I can&#x27;t get the link to work at all in any way--tried copying,
&gt; pasting, clicking, hand-typing, partial url, etc. Are you sure it is
&gt; correct?

&gt; &gt; Actually, the forum there is pretty active.  I found the link I had
&gt; mentioned. I&#x27;m sure this will not be &#x27;clickable&#x27; because the link is
&gt; too long for Yahoo posts like this one. You may have to cut and paste
&gt; this into a browser. The title may come off sounding a bit negative,
&gt; don&#x27;t shoot the messanger :-).

&gt; &gt; Well, I&#x27;m glad to hear it, but as of last week, the leaders were
&gt; &gt; unreceptive to the idea that this phenomenon was real.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a radio sweep forum on AA-EVP for members. They have also
&gt; &gt; created an Etheric studies wiki that mentions Frank&#x27;s Box and the Mini
&gt; &gt; Box. I&#x27;ll see if I can find the link for this, it is accessable by the
&gt; &gt; public.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Very interested. And I agree with you about the overnight change.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; Orgs like AA-EVP that aren&#x27;t dealing with the boxes are missing
the  
&gt; &gt; &gt; boat.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well guys, I have to tell you that since I started box sessions in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; November I have become so spoiled that conventional EVP just
&gt; don&#x27;t do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it for me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My organization was asked to come and do an investigation at a
very
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; historial place (here in Illinois). The owner of this home asked
&gt; if I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immediately 2 way communication). So upon respectfully asking
my tec
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if it was alright to do a session outside the my home we did
several
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box sessions along with conventional EVP. We wanted to see if we
&gt; could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discover some unanswered history about the residence, and the  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; otherside
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was more than willing to comply.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were and
are the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most boring data to review. Something I use to love so much has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually turned into a project given I am waiting for a response
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immediately! Too funny how things can change overnight!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will be uploading some files for these sessions if you are  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested.
