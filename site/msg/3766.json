This \n\nis a fact compared to perception=\r\ns and opinions. &gt; &gt; Fact: Almost each \n\nand every user of a box or it&#39;s fac=\r\nsimile have&gt; stated that lower \n\nenergy/evil/ dark... entities have spoken =\r\nvia the&gt; device. &gt; &gt; Fact: \n\nRick Moran states that the groups for testing =\r\nwill include&gt; \n\nbelievers, skeptics, senior citizens, (now here&#39;s where it =\r\ngets scary)\n\n&gt; CHILDREN and HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS!&gt; &gt; - Couple the last two =\r\nfacts \n\ntogether and do the math. One mentally&gt; unstable child or youth hea=\r\nrs \n\nthe box tell him it is right to kill or&gt; rape or .....&gt; &gt; Fact: Rick \n=\r\n\nMoran in his article about Tools being only as good as the&gt; users \n\nstates=\r\n, &quot;...know how they work before you go into the field.&quot; &gt; So, \n\nin one plac=\r\ne we are still testing, in another we are sending them&gt; \n\nout in the field =\r\nto be tested by groups that include children and \n\nhigh&gt; school students. T=\r\nhe good thing is that a nice little online \n\ntutorial&gt; is available with so=\r\nme warnings. Phew! As long as this \n\ncan&#39;t come back&gt; on anyone I guess all=\r\n the bases are covered (tongue \n\nin cheek). &gt; &gt; Fact: Chris has been the pr=\r\nimary tester of the device \n\nin the field.&gt; That fact deserves consideratio=\r\nn, at the very least. &gt; \n\n&gt; Fact: Last night, a radio personality on Spooky=\r\n South Coast \n\nclaimed&gt; that after he engaged the dark voices coming throug=\r\nh the \n\nbox, he was&gt; physically attacked.&gt; &gt; Fact: Frank has stated that in=\r\n \n\nthe beginning Chris was the only one&gt; who understood how the box \n\nshoul=\r\nd be used.&gt; &gt; Fact: Some people who have received boxes from \n\nFrank discov=\r\nered they&gt; were not able to use them although they worked \n\nfine for Frank.=\r\n These&gt; same people would not return the boxes to be \n\nlooked at.&gt; &gt; Fact: =\r\nAfter death communications have been received via \n\nboth computers&gt; and pho=\r\nnes. If it were simply the devices and not the \n\nusers would we&gt; not have m=\r\nillions of these communications? &gt; &gt; Fact: \n\nMark Macy states that in an af=\r\nter death communication&gt; communication \n\nwith Konstanin Raudive in which Ma=\r\nrk asks &quot; Can you tell&gt; me about \n\nthe equipment you use to produce a perfe=\r\nct, almost perfect&gt; voice on \n\nearth?&quot; Konstanin replies &quot;Well it depends o=\r\nn your reception-&gt; or \n\nmainly your psychic reception.&quot; This fact backs up =\r\nthe theory that&gt; \n\neffective users are limited.&gt; &gt; Fact: In another after d=\r\neath \n\ncommunication Konstanin addresses contact&gt; fields saying &quot;...but if =\r\n\n\nthere is dissonance in the form of fears,&gt; doubts, and animosities \n\nthe =\r\ncontact field becomes cloudy...that&#39; s when&gt; negative spirit \n\ngroups close=\r\n to earth in vibration can break into&gt; existing bridges \n\nwith troubling re=\r\nsults.&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; And so yes, maybe I wear rose colored \n\nglasses. However, I am=\r\n inclined&gt; to believe that I have done my \n\nresearch and have availed mysel=\r\nf of&gt; quite a bit of information \n\nregarding this topic. &gt; &gt; With that said=\r\n, I am holding an online \n\nevent where people can ask&gt; Chris the questions =\r\nthey want as long as \n\nthey are formed in an&gt; intelligent manner.

Yet,&gt; because he is against=\r\n mass &lt;br&gt;\nproduction, it MUST be because he wants the&gt; research all to =\r\nhimself. &lt;br&gt;\nRose colored glasses or a case of only seeing&gt; what is wan=\r\nted? This &lt;br&gt;\nis a fact compared to perceptions and opinions. &gt; &gt; Fa=\r\nct: Almost each &lt;br&gt;\nand every user of a box or it&#39;s facsimile have&gt; sta=\r\nted that lower &lt;br&gt;\nenergy/evil/ dark... entities have spoken via the&gt; d=\r\nevice. &gt; &gt; Fact: &lt;br&gt;\nRick Moran states that the groups for testing w=\r\nill include&gt; &lt;br&gt;\nbelievers, skeptics, senior citizens, (now here&#39;s wher=\r\ne it gets scary)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; CHILDREN and HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS!&gt; &gt; - Cou=\r\nple the last two facts &lt;br&gt;\ntogether and do the math. One mentally&gt; unst=\r\nable child or youth hears &lt;br&gt;\nthe box tell him it is right to kill or&gt; =\r\nrape or .....&gt; &gt; Fact: Rick &lt;br&gt;\nMoran in his article about Tools bei=\r\nng only as good as the&gt; users &lt;br&gt;\nstates, &quot;...know how they work before=\r\n you go into the field.&quot; &gt; So, &lt;br&gt;\nin one place we are still testing, i=\r\nn another we are sending them&gt; &lt;br&gt;\nout in the field to be tested by gro=\r\nups that include children and &lt;br&gt;\nhigh&gt; school students. The good thing=\r\n is that a nice little online &lt;br&gt;\ntutorial&gt; is available with some warn=\r\nings. Phew! As long as this &lt;br&gt;\ncan&#39;t come back&gt; on anyone I guess all =\r\nthe bases are covered (tongue &lt;br&gt;\nin cheek). &gt; &gt; Fact: Chris has bee=\r\nn the primary tester of the device &lt;br&gt;\nin the field.&gt; That fact deserve=\r\ns consideration, at the very least. &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Fact: Last night, a radi=\r\no personality on Spooky South Coast &lt;br&gt;\nclaimed&gt; that after he engaged =\r\nthe dark voices coming through the &lt;br&gt;\nbox, he was&gt; physically attacked=\r\n.&gt; &gt; Fact: Frank has stated that in &lt;br&gt;\nthe beginning Chris was the =\r\nonly one&gt; who understood how the box &lt;br&gt;\nshould be used.&gt; &gt; Fact:=\r\n Some people who have received boxes from &lt;br&gt;\nFrank discovered they&gt; we=\r\nre not able to use them although they worked &lt;br&gt;\nfine for Frank. These&gt;=\r\n same people would not return the boxes to be &lt;br&gt;\nlooked at.&gt; &gt; Fact=\r\n: After death communications have been received via &lt;br&gt;\nboth computers&gt;=\r\n and phones. If it were simply the devices and not the &lt;br&gt;\nusers would we&=\r\ngt; not have millions of these communications? &gt; &gt; Fact: &lt;br&gt;\nMark Ma=\r\ncy states that in an after death communication&gt; communication &lt;br&gt;\nwith =\r\nKonstanin Raudive in which Mark asks &quot; Can you tell&gt; me about &lt;br&gt;\nthe e=\r\nquipment you use to produce a perfect, almost perfect&gt; voice on &lt;br&gt;\near=\r\nth?&quot; Konstanin replies &quot;Well it depends on your reception-&gt; or &lt;br&gt;\nmain=\r\nly your psychic reception.&quot; This fact backs up the theory that&gt; &lt;br&gt;\neff=\r\nective users are limited.&gt; &gt; Fact: In another after death &lt;br&gt;\ncommun=\r\nication Konstanin addresses contact&gt; fields saying &quot;...but if &lt;br&gt;\nthere=\r\n is dissonance in the form of fears,&gt; doubts, and animosities &lt;br&gt;\nthe c=\r\nontact field becomes cloudy...that&#39; s when&gt; negative spirit &lt;br&gt;\ngroups =\r\nclose to earth in vibration can break into&gt; existing bridges &lt;br&gt;\nwith t=\r\nroubling results.&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; And so yes, maybe I wear rose colored &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nglasses. However, I am inclined&gt; to believe that I have done my &lt;br&gt;\nre=\r\nsearch and have availed myself of&gt; quite a bit of information &lt;br&gt;\nregar=\r\nding this topic. &gt; &gt; With that said, I am holding an online &lt;br&gt;\neven=\r\nt where people can ask&gt; Chris the questions they want as long as &lt;br&gt;\nth=\r\ney are formed in an&gt; intelligent manner. If you are interested in &lt;br&gt;\na=\r\nttending the event you&gt; can find the information on the front page &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nof my site at&gt; www.thepsinetwork. com I felt it unnecessary to attempt &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nto &quot;bridge the&gt; gap&quot; as well between speculation, insinuation and &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nfact. &gt; &gt; Sincerely,&gt; Babs&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;mailto:ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;ITC@yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Lance Oliver=\r\n&quot; &lt;orbhunterx@ &gt; wrote:&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hey &lt;br&gt;\nBab,&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Even though I&#39;ve newly begun to chime in here, it seems &lt;br&gt;\nto me th=\r\nat &gt; &gt; some people are guilty of wearing rose colored &lt;br&gt;\nglasses, a=\r\ns far as &gt; &gt; Chris is concerned.
