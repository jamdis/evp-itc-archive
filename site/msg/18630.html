<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>&quot;So if someone is saying that something you have worked on for years is all
in your head while they completely ignore all evidence and results, you just
sit quiet, don&#x27;t say a word cuz someone might get upset? &quot;

No, it&#x27;s that you don&#x27;t say anything argumentative. You take the high road.
If you feel you must say something, you can say &quot;we&#x27;ll have to agree to
disagree,&quot; or &quot;that is your opinion,&quot; etc, because it is just their opinion.
No need to get personal, insulting, emotional or overly defensive. If you
believe in what you are doing, what does it matter what anyone else in the
whole universe believes?

There is intelligent debate, and then there is petty arguments. Getting
petty does nothing for you or your cause, and only brings you down to your
opponents petty levels.

The old adage really holds true-if you can&#x27;t say something nice, don&#x27;t say
anything at all.

&gt;
&gt; In the meantime, if some chase only the dark shadows, &quot;investigate&quot; in the
&gt; dark at night, get growling voices saying &quot;get oput&quot;--that must be the
&gt; absolute truth!
&gt;
&gt; There seems to be no way to beat the negativity on this planet. All focus
&gt; on the darkside, the lies, the misinformation. All seek only fear and evil,
&gt; the drama, Hollywood fame. No place for truth of anykind or form here.
&gt;
&gt; Think I&#x27;m done here.

&gt; &gt; I agree, If you don&#x27;t like what somebody says, just push delete.Â  There
&gt; are so many
&gt; &gt; other things going on in the world to get upset about.Â  You just attract
&gt; more negativity.

&gt; &gt; &quot;No, I live in heaven, and my affections

&gt; &gt; Yes, I am. I try to stay objective and I&#x27;ve read your past e-mails and
&gt; honestly, I think a lot of people are reading things into what you post that
&gt; I do not see. I do not understand the hostility that is being flung at you.
&gt; People are misunderstanding you tremendously for some reason.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I expect none of us like all the recent attacks, insults, accusations,
&gt; threats, hurting of feelings, and attempts to piss people off.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can I suggest we stick to the purpose of the group: &quot;the discussion,
&gt; promotion, and developemnt of Electronic Voice Phenomenon, and Instrumental
&gt; Transcommunication methods and technologies as used in the communication
&gt; with spirit, and other entities.&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And that we go with Frank&#x27;s philosophy &quot;just take the approach, try
&gt; different methods, see what works.&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No more threats. No name calling, insults, or accusations. Just try to
&gt; keep a positive group attitude, be open that not everyone believes what
&gt; everyone else does, and that&#x27;s ok?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
