The antenna unit\nloosely plugs into the top of the wire antenna connector on the\nMini-Box.  That antenna was on prototype #3, the first demonstration\nmodel, but dropped in favor of a wire antenna on the production models.\n\nAllen Slaughter\nwww.paranormalsource.com\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rosemary_guiley&quot; &lt;reguiley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s a fold-down antenna I got from Ron Ricketts, the creator of the\n&gt; Mini, via April Slaughter, who arranged for me to get the first\n&gt; commercially available box.  It&#39;s not part of the package that comes\n&gt; with the Mini.  A wire antenna works too.  I don&#39;t always use it --\n&gt; depends on the reception.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rosemary\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, psfponies &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rosemary\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; What kind of antenna are you using with your mini box?\n&gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;"}
