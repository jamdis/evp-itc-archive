I don&#39;t have much use for ego maniacs that think \ntheir groups, or what ever are so important, and so profound that no \none dare question anything. \n\n I don&#39;t care if anyone thinks what I do is fake. Even if it&#39;s fake, \nhow come no one has yet to duplicate it? I think they are just jealous \ncuz the only voices they get are in their heads, (as in Schizophrenic).\nSo far, no one tries to make the circuits as described, they claim to \ntry the method, but not what I made, then claim it doesn&#39;t work, one \nguy even claimed he was building it with vacuum tubes! Well, dah, I \nwonder why it doen&#39;t work. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised that for every five \ndoing real EVP work, there&#39;s 20 trying to debunk it. \n\n I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more than one here with affiliations with other \ngroups, who cares! The internet is a big place. \n\n I think they were hoping I would follow a previoyus pattern of \ngetting pissed off, then quit the group, not gonna happen! I try to \nlearn from my mistakes. \n\n The group is still open to anyone, it seems like the nut cases ban \nthem selves! LOL!\n\n\n Frank"}
