To me, Moon is out there using the \nboxes in public, and that&#39;s how many find out about it, so he might as \nwell have better stuff. \n\n Frank-S\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Leah&quot; &lt;leahsodyssey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am concerend because Chris Moon is using Frank&#39;s box under his name \nto make money.  He \n&gt; charges $250 for a half hour session with this box.  I wouldn&#39;t be so \nirritated had he just \n&gt; called it something else, but this is Frank&#39;s and it should be up to \nFrank how this box is used.  \n&gt; I think using it to make money is wrong.  I am not saying it would be \nwrong for Frank to \n&gt; market it it, at a reasonable price, but to charge $250 for a session \nthat is under the \n&gt; interpretation of Chris Moon is just playing on those who are \nsuffering from a loss and \n&gt; looking for a connection.\n&gt;"}
