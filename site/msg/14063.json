This is why a valuable tool \nin the scientifi=\r\nc  arsenal is the double (and triple) blind study.  It \nattempts to  remove=\r\n the often uncontrollable subjectivity inherent in all people, \n even scien=\r\ntists!  Science uses this technique to help keep even  itself as \nhonest as=\r\n possible.  So if you are finding that the  evidence is being \nignored, the=\r\n reason may not be the evidence itself  (no matter how compelling). \nIt may=\r\n very well be the manner in which it  is collected, and interpreted: \nall a=\r\nt least as important as the audio  itself.\n\nEVP=E2=80=99s are perfectly all=\r\nowed to throw monkey wrenches,  and even kitchen \nsinks into scientific the=\r\nories and accepted dogmas:  but only if they follow \nscience=E2=80=99s rule=\r\ns.  It=E2=80=99s like trying to put  a new medicine on the market with \ncla=\r\nims that it destroys accepted  dogmas: but, if the testing has not been \nri=\r\ngorous and up to accepted  medical standards, its hard to blame consumers \n=\r\nfor being doubtful of  its claims.\n\nScience is not magic: it is a simple pr=\r\nocess  really, but it forces a claim \nto really be solidly confirmed. It se=\r\nems  to me that, while EVP research \nhas its toe in the water of scientific=\r\n  methodology (it is making \nobservations, collecting evidence, and  making=\r\n theories), it seems to be obsessed on \nthat phase of science,  and not on =\r\nthe hard part: designing and conducting \nobjective tests to  conform or dis=\r\nmiss the theories.  It seems that so many \npeople  are having so much fun w=\r\nith their audio devices and results, that they  \nare maybe afraid of taking=\r\n it to the next step of serious testing,  maybe \nbecause of the risk this t=\r\nesting could destroy their  fun.\n\nBut they should maybe consider it might N=\r\nOT destroy their  fun, but instead \nthat next phase of testing may be just =\r\nwhat the  doctors ordered to bring \nEVP into mainline science: real,  scien=\r\nce-based testing.  I fear the people \naccepted as the real  experts and pio=\r\nneers in this field (like you Frank) \nwill never get any  acknowledgement o=\r\nf their achievements unless they have are \nable to  move into this next pha=\r\nse.\n\nScience wants you to piss on its  fire, Frank.  But you have to go whe=\r\nre \nthe fire is.    And the way there is through the entire scientific meth=\r\nod, not \njust  the early fun parts, but the hard testing parts.  But I  und=\r\nerstand \nhow difficult that prospect can be, and that it would take  your f=\r\nocus off \nthe part you seem to like best (experimenting with the  equipment=\r\n).  If you \nare unable to bring yourself to the testing  phase, it might be=\r\n worth looking \nat partnering up with others who  would focus on that part =\r\nfor you?

It seems \n          to me that, while EVP rese=\r\narch has its toe in the water of scientific \n          methodology (it is m=\r\naking observations, collecting evidence, and \n          making theories), i=\r\nt seems to be obsessed on that phase of science, \n          and not on the =\r\nhard part: designing and conducting objective tests to \n          conform o=\r\nr dismiss the theories.&nbsp; It seems that so many people \n          are h=\r\naving so much fun with their audio devices and results, that they \n        =\r\n  are maybe afraid of taking it to the next step of serious testing, \n     =\r\n     maybe because of the risk this testing could destroy their \n          =\r\nfun.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But they should maybe consider it might NOT destroy their \n    =\r\n      fun, but instead that next phase of testing may be just what the \n   =\r\n       doctors ordered to bring EVP into mainline science: real, \n         =\r\n science-based testing.&nbsp; I fear the people accepted as the real \n     =\r\n     experts and pioneers in this field (like you Frank) will never get any=\r\n \n          acknowledgement of their achievements unless they have are able=\r\n to \n          move into this next phase.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Science wants you to piss =\r\non its \n          fire, Frank.&nbsp; But you have to go where the fire is.&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; \n          And the way there is through the entire scientific m=\r\nethod, not just \n          the early fun parts, but the hard testing parts.=\r\n&nbsp; But I \n          understand how difficult that prospect can be, and =\r\nthat it would take \n          your focus off the part you seem to like best=\r\n (experimenting with the \n          equipment).&nbsp; If you are unable to =\r\nbring yourself to the testing \n          phase, it might be worth looking a=\r\nt partnering up with others who \n          would focus on that part for you=\r\n?&nbsp; I think a very dynamic team of \n          people could be formed wi=\r\nth you focused on the technology creation, \n          and they focused on t=\r\nhe more mundane aspects of rigorous blind study \n          testing.&nbsp; D=\r\no you think that would be valuable to you, and to the \n          field of E=\r\nVP studies? \n          &lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Mon,=\r\n 5/4/09, Frank \n          Sumption &lt;I&gt;&lt;&lt;A title=3Dmailto:purplealiengirl=\r\n@... \n          href=3D&quot;mailto:purplealiengirl@...&quot; \n          =\r\ntarget=3D_blank&gt;purplealiengirl@&lt;WBR&gt;gmail.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; \n          w=\r\nrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) =\r\n2px solid&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: Frank Sumption &lt;&lt;A \n  =\r\n          title=3Dmailto:purplealiengirl@... \n            href=3D&quot;mai=\r\nlto:purplealiengirl@...&quot; \n            target=3D_blank&gt;purplealiengirl=\r\n@&lt;WBR&gt;gmail.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;Subject: Re: =\r\n[EVP-ITC] Re: People given a grant to do \n            what you all are doin=\r\ng,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;To: &lt;A title=3Dmailto:EVP-ITC@yaho=\r\nogroups.com \n            href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot; \n         =\r\n   target=3D_blank&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Date: \n       =\r\n     Monday, May 4, 2009, 9:28 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;\n            &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\nIt&#39;s not that it can&#39;t be proven, it&#39;s that all evidence \n            is de=\r\nemed unacceptable- -a convinient way to make uncompfortable \n            fa=\r\ncts go away.&nbsp; The fact is&nbsp; most of the EVP evidence \n            =\r\npretty much contradicts, or at least throws a monkey wrench in many \n      =\r\n      so called scientific theories, and accepted dogma.

The AAEVP/Sarah Est=\r\nep Research Fund is not for \n                  AAEVP to do the research, it=\r\n&#39;s for them to fund OUTSIDE \n                  organizations for THEIR scie=\r\nntific research on the study of \n                  EVP. The Windbridge Inst=\r\nitute received some of this sponsor \n                  money for what they =\r\ncalled &quot;Real-time EVP Conversations: A \n                  Pilot Study.&quot; The=\r\n method for this communication was *not* \n                  based on radio =\r\nsweep, nor traditional methods, so it&#39;s not \n                  based on wha=\r\nt I assume many people here are doing. And in \n                  fact, it *=\r\nwas* based on the creations of someone outside of \n                  the US=\r\nA, so I&#39;m a little confused as to why all the hostility \n                  =\r\ntoward AAEVP for putting up the money.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sadly, radio \n               =\r\n   sweep methods don&#39;t, and may not for a long time, get the \n             =\r\n     respect of the scientific community that it deserves (then \n          =\r\n        again, seems no form of EVP does), but at least this current \n     =\r\n             research is a step in the right direction. I hope, when \n     =\r\n             Windbridge concludes their study, that it will support the \n  =\r\n                notion that there is apparent communication formed in ways =\r\n\n                  that cannot be explained by currently known and understo=\r\nod \n                  laws of nature. THAT alone, in my opinion, would be a=\r\n big plus \n                  for all ITC communities, regardless of the met=\r\nhod from which \n                  that communication was received. What&#39;s t=\r\nhe old saying? &quot;It \n                  takes but one white crow to prove all=\r\n crows are not black.&quot; \n                  Any proof, derived from any EVP m=\r\nethod, would be greatly \n                  welcomed as far as I&#39;m concerned=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Margaret &lt;/P&gt;\n                  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A \n          =\r\n        title=3Dhttp://mc/compose?to=3DEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n           =\r\n       href=3D&quot;http://mc/compose?to=3DEVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; \n         =\r\n         target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;/A&gt;, Frank=\r\n \n                  Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n                  It&#39;s the same old stuff, everyone wants to complet=\r\nely ignore \n                  absolutely all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; work that has been in =\r\nthis field since \n                  the caveman and act like they just&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; discovered spirit \n                  and EVP.
