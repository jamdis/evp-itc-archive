<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rees.  I think we can only speculate at this point.  With all the references to air, it makes 
me assume that an &#x27;air person&#x27; could be the &#x27;humans&#x27; (as has also been referenced) who 
are using their &#x27;air portals&#x27; - thereby making us &#x27;air people&#x27; ... not necessarily that we 
breath air, which could be the case as well, but I&#x27;m sort of leaning toward this term being a 
reference of communication.  

If we &quot;enter their air&quot; through &quot;air portals&quot; and they &quot;give us air&quot; for communication, I think 
that makes us &quot;air people&quot; in their frame of reference.  But really, that&#x27;s just a guess.

&gt; I know that both Bruce and Margaret and few others have gotten 
&gt; messages about the &quot;Air People&quot; I am not sure myself.

&gt; &gt; I was doing a real time session (I not set up to record my 
&gt; sessions 
&gt; &gt; yet) I asked if anyone there knew about the Air People. I got a 
&gt; &gt; response of &quot;YES _ BRUCE&quot;
