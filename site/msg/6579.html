The last 3 clips you can hear our tecs warning us that there is a Dark Head or negitive spirit about to come through.  One of the women present (who only believes in Angels and Demons, not ghosts) proceeded to ask the spirit coming through if he was evil.  Needless to say, this particular negitive spirit didn't seem to like her much!
   
  I wanted to attach these files to reflect the fact that our tec's do warn us and we need to pay attention to what is coming through.  They are there to guild us so our sessions are positive and get the most out of our two way communication.
   
   
  Thanks!
  Juli
