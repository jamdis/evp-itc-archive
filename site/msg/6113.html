Also, congrats on the messages.  Sarah picked a good technician on this side as well.
   
  Bruce, I am wondering if you or anyone close to Sarah Estep know the meaning or significance of her saying "All my projects had wistles."  Could she have had a special message or signal she left here with others?  It could be a great validation for them.  If you learn about this please share the rest of the story.  Quite a session, huh?   Ron L

          Bill,
 
Thanks for the compliment on the files, but the credit goes to Sarah and my spirit techs.
I'm only the listener.
 
I have heard a brief recording of Ms. Esteps voice and yes it does resemble her physical voice.
 
I believe I am the first to have communication from her following her transition into spirit.
Or I am the first to post files anyway. I hope to have much more communication from her
in future sessions, something tells me I will.
 
If you or anyone you know is familiar with her family, you may want to let them know she is ok and in communication
and where they can hear the files.
 
Bruce

      Bruce, these are pretty amazing. I'm not sure if you have listened to
known recordings of her voice, but some of the responses even sound
like her! I listened to her at length in Atlanta, then had a 45 minute
conversation with her afterwards and she had a distinctive voice I
feel I'm recognizing here. -Bill
