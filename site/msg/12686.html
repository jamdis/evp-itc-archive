<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ron!

I myself was very pleased to read your last posting!  My team and I 
have been using the box for less than three weeks,  I will post the 
results on esnips.  I have become increasingly aware that there is a 
lot more going on than simply speaking with the other side (what we 
once considered those who have passed.)  It appears that there are 
communications coming in from various avenues that I am unfamiliar 
with.  Some are pleasant, some are angry, and some seem to come from 
a place or places that I have yet to grasp!  I am pleased to know 
that you are out there seraching, researching with an open mind as we 
are here in MI!  The box is a whole different ball game.  I am so 
pleased that I am not alone in this research.  Thank you Frank, Ron  
and everyone in this group.

&gt; Thanks David for coming out with info on Dr Rorke. I will tell you 
briefly that some of the info he provided in the C2C show and on his 
web site was a real eye opener for me. I have now completed about 
one year of checking out EVP and I have learned an awful lot about 
myself and the other side. One year ago when I began my 
investigation I would not have dared make such a claim to the public 
nor to myself. 
&gt; 
&gt; I do understand a bit about the scientific process. But, I would 
welcome anyone from the scientificworld to do one simple thing: 
join this or another EVP group, buy a radio shack hack, modify it for 
less than $50, and go talk to yourself somewhere with the hack turned 
on. Now, that does not sound like a scientific approach, but what I 
am finding in my research is that supposedly serious scientific 
researchers will not do this simple test. When I ask them to come 
check outour group and participate with their ownboxthey instead 
choose to sit on the sidelines and wait for others to offer proof to 
them.Maybe there is no research money in it for them...who would 
give big bucks for EVP research? However, it seems to me that any 
serious investigator in this arena would jump at a chance test it out 
for $50 and two months of their time...part time.
&gt; 
&gt; My challenge would be for any &quot;scientific researcher&quot;, therefore, 
is to come join a group, buy a box, try to communicate,share results 
with the group,share what others are experiencing,and truly 
participate with the group. In a month or two, the researcher can 
then quit thegroup, if he or she wishes, and begin &quot;real&quot; research. 
I say this becauseIam confident that theirexperience with actually 
getting involvedas anon-scientist will be transformational in two 
months or less.Oh yea,this serious researcher shouldknow that 
he/she can join a group without anyone knowing who they really are. 
Get a new email address and go for it. 
&gt; 
&gt; If someone goes through this simple process and still wants to 
apply the scientific method to this study, I for one, would volunteer 
to assist them in any way. That is, after they use a box for two 
months. 
&gt; 
&gt; Having said all that, I remain very interested inwhat Dr. Rorke 
said, particularly about &quot;other&quot;communicators whomay be coming 
through whowe takeas EVP phenomena. This is very troubling to me 
and I will continue to look into it.Thanks again for your 
info.

&gt; 
&gt; Yes I have experience with Dr. Rorke. He is coming at it from a 
scientific POV. His stance is based on the lack of scientific 
evidence, controlled experiments and claims that can easily be 
duplicated. This is why ITC is scoffed by the scientific community. 
Making extraordinary claims without scientific evidence to back it up 
makes every EVP researcher look like a cool aid drinker. Mr. Moon 
originally indicated that only a magic thirty people could make the 
device work, which would suggest selective physics. Physics works the 
same for everyone, and any real proof must have scientific principles 
backing it up.
&gt; 
&gt; He is open to there being something to it. It just hasn&#x27;t stood up 
yet to serious scientific scrutiny. So far it has failed at every 
turn. Spiricom was a fraud. The interesting part of the story is why 
it was a fraud. It reveals things about the individuals psychology 
that gives a great deal of insight about perceptions and ego. We want 
to believe it works, and often times it makes us fall victim to 
pareidolia. Case in point. Take a recording of a voice produced by 
any one of these devices. Play it in isolation to five people. Have 
them write down what they hear. If they all hear the same thing 
alone, then there is something to it. If they all hear something 
different, it is Gaussian noise and pareidolia, a well documented 
effect.
&gt; 
&gt; This is why serious, disciplined research is tantamount to this 
part of the field ever being taken seriously.
