Also, with FB we were getting the voice of someone we know who\ncurrently has a mysterious nerve disorder. All of the suggested causes\nhave been ruled out although the symptoms remain but are treatable. We\nwere surprised to hear his voice which was later joined by another\nperson we know who is also living. The person with the nerve disorder\nsaid &quot;Tuesday&quot; several times. I called the gentleman on the phone to\ntell him about our Box session and he told me they had decided several\ndays prior that they were going to hold ITC experiments on the first\nTuesday of every month. He runs a small paranormal team and I&#39;ve had\nBox sessions with them already. -Bill\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I just got my Joe&#39;s Box #2 back, which is what i started with and had \n&gt; much success.  I did a 10 min. session this morning and only went over \n&gt; the first 1 min. so far, but wanted to share a couple.  The &quot;Seven&quot; \n&gt; file may be pertaining to the &quot;seven&#39; we are all getting.  2 good \n&gt; messages so far and i haven&#39;t asked a question yet....Maybe Frank is \n&gt; right?  If we listen, maybe they will tell us what we need to know and \n&gt; could it be possible that our questions are sidetracking them from \n&gt; getting their point across.  Just something to think about.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
