I have info on people that have been murdered too, spirit\n&gt; gave names, places for where the body was found, and other cases as well.  I\n&gt; don&#39;t call that merely spirit entertaining themselves with what I want to\n&gt; hear.  If we &#39;test the spirits&quot; and if we don&#39;t make a game out of this,\n&gt; they will take things seriously too.  Of course we talk through the mind\n&gt; over there because we no longer have vocal cords to use.  Some where in\n&gt; Bible it says something like, nothing is kept hidden, to each is own, I just\n&gt; take it more seriously then others, it&#39;s not a parlor game after all they\n&gt; are just people too. sf\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: JANDANACOSTA &lt;jandan108@yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;  Sent: Wed, Jun 9, 2010 9:30 pm\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Alert,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    I totally agree, Tim. This is a complicated issue. Spirit seems to be\n&gt; able to know our thoughts prior to our speaking, as well so if a Spirit\n&gt; might want to trick or endear themselves to the communicator, then there is\n&gt; a possibility of misinformation or lying.\n&gt; If as researchers, we are only attempting to establish that Spirit\n&gt; Communication actually exsists, then we must be more generalized in the\n&gt; questions we ask. If one has a topic on their mind or a need to have\n&gt; specific information given to them, the research will automatically become\n&gt; questionable, IMO.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Wed, 6/9/10, tim_woolworth &lt;tim@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: tim_woolworth &lt;tim@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Alert,\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, June 9, 2010, 1:41 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I would be cautious accepting responses from a box as gospel. I have had\n&gt; contradictory responses about religion come through, but then again, I align\n&gt; myself much closer with atheism than christianity.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many times I feel that the boxes tell us what we want to hear. Why? I could\n&gt; not tell you. It could be spirits playing with our heads, or, it could be a\n&gt; piece of our unconscious coming through the radio. This does happen, I have\n&gt; recorded the voices of people in the same room with me coming through with\n&gt; the same speech patterns (although this happened twice with a Shack hack but\n&gt; I haven&#39;t had it happen with my Minibox yet).\n&gt;\n&gt; So in short, if you ascribe to a belief and keep asking pointed questions\n&gt; about that belief over and over, do not be surprised when you hear what you\n&gt; believe coming through the box.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tim\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; gee, I&#39;ll be sure to make note of it, sf\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In a message dated 6/9/2010 1:31:09 P.M.
