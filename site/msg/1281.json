I have been a PI and researcher for many years and am very \ninterested in this technology. I have heard a demonstration of the box \nby chris moon and he has stated that a message recieved by him from \nthomas edison has informed him that only 30 people on earth will be \nable to operate this box succesfully. Can anyone tell me if this is \ntrue or can anyone attempt research with franks box and be sucessfull? \nAnd if so how can I go about obtaining one? \nany help is appreciated.\n\nbruce halliday P.I.T. paranormal investigating team of south new jersey."}
