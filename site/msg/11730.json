It&#39;s\npretty cool.  YOu can set it on scan, just like the r/s hack, and let it\nphonetically put together words.  I&#39;m still in the experimental stages,\nbut I&#39;m very interested. I&#39;m considering getting the Ovilus II when it is\navalaible.\n\nCarol B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; I thought it was pretty neat that it repeated the word &quot;worry&quot; when\n&gt; Ryan asked if it was worried they&#39;d bring in a priest.\n&gt; What are the odds of that just based on environmental readings? If I\n&gt; had an extra $200 laying around I&#39;d be buying myself one to play with.\n&gt; ~Elabeth\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Aug 12, 2008 at 7:41 AM, Fransen, Debbie\n&gt; &lt;debbie.fransen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know how many of the members watch Paranormal State, but they\n&gt;&gt; used\n&gt;&gt; a new piece of equipment called The Ovilus. You guys have got to check\n&gt;&gt; this\n&gt;&gt; out. Go to www.digitaldowsing.com. I am not really sure who these guys\n&gt;&gt; are,\n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; where they came up with this. To me, it sounds kind of like Frank&#39;s Box,\n&gt;&gt; but\n&gt;&gt; not the same.\n&gt;&gt; Frank, please take a look at this, and tell us what  you think.\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t understand how it works......\n&gt;&gt; Deb\n&gt;"}
