You accuse me of dripping sarcasm and insults.
Could you show me where I've=
 done that?

      Dear Ms. Aberc=

It seems that you misunderstand how some of us react to posts by=
 "RJ."

sound a little silly to me.  To me, they're rather like someone clearly hol=
ding the salt cellar in one hand and asking me, "Which hand has the salt?"
=



If it's a small child asking, that's amusing.  If it's an adult, it seem=
s a bit insulting.  I don't expect the spirits to feel any differently.



=
But that's neither here nor there; the tests are not the issue.



What is =
troublesome is the rhetoric chosen by RJ. While sarcasm rarely conveys well=
 in text, RJ's posts are so dripping with sarcasm, the tone is impossible t=
o overlook.  



Further, arguing over this seems a waste of everyone's tim=
e.  I doubt that anyone is going to change his or her mind. If this group's=
 primary function is to swap insults rather than pool research results and =
brainstorm new approaches to this science, I should probably leave.



Sinc=
erely,

Fiona Broome
