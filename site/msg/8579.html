<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah it makes one wonder. Then again this country not to mention the 
world as a whole has always been on the brink of new technology which 
they either cover up or covet to the point others rarely know of its 
existence. I wonder what else is laying around that was invented that 
nobody knows about or told others about. I found the smoke thing 
interesting tho. Never would have thought of that one so I was amazed 
that someone else did so long before edisons work became the 
forefront of technology. Considering the time frame it makes me 
ponder if he had heard of the work or just the idea even was enough 
to set his wheels turning and get him thinking in that direction.

&gt; Hi Misty,
&gt; 
&gt; yeah, fascinating; however, I wonder why mechanical audio recording 
and
&gt; reproduction techniques haven&#x27;t been invented much earlier, since 
the
&gt; technical principle behind that is actually quite straightforward. I
&gt; could easily imagine that someone like Leonardo da Vinci could have
&gt; invented such a machine...

interesting.
