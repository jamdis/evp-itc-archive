Your practice of ITC research does not mean you cannot care for your child.=
 Social services do not take your children for your beliefs, they take them=
 because you are not able to care for them properly and/or are abusive. Loo=
k at any number of fanatical religious practices or=A0belief systems=A0just=
 in the US and you see a bunch of children being subjected to some pretty s=
cary ideas. Belief is not a requisite for this research, only the desire to=
 communicate.

Mental health is defined as the psychological state of someo=
ne who is functioning at a satisfactory level of emotional, cognitive=A0and=
 behavioral adjustment. The condition of 'normal' would be defined as the a=
verage of social expectations, which can be completely different from one c=
ulture to the next. I'm not bragging by stating that I am in the process of=
 completling my master of science in Psychology. I am just adding a little =
credibility to my definitions.

Regards,

Frank R.
