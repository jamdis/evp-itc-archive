I did get a chance to play several of your files but I was late for work so never got a chance to reply and got home and took a long nap and forgot about group stuff for a while =)\n   \n  I worked almost 12 hours today and have group later tonight but I will try and check out some more of your files tomorrow.\n   \n  Great stuff from all of you. I know I dont say it enough or post enough feedback but I try and listen to everything as I read posts, I just dont always have time to reply to everyone. Thats why many of you know I am quicker to reply to private mail directed specifically at me rather than groups. When I do have time I share my thoughts. \n   \n  Misty\n   \n   \n   \n   \n  bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n          Come on guy&#39;s a little feedback!\n\nI posted 16 files two day&#39;s ago from the RSbox and only got 2 replies \nand both were from ann.\n\nI posted a bunch of frank&#39;s box files today and not one response.\n\nlets jump start this group with some new and positive energy everybody \ndo some sessions and post the results, lets start the advance into the \nfuture.\n\nBruce\n\n\n\n                         \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
