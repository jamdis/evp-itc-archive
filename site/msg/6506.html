<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Robin,

I uploaded some of my recordings that indicate a bigger picture.

Some of the messages say there are &quot;many spirits here,&quot; spirit rescue 
is &quot;very important,&quot; etc.  You can go through them under LC&#x27;s folder.

Last Friday, I recorded with respect to 2008, &quot;psychic event&quot; 
and &quot;universal shift.&quot;  That would indicate that there is a bigger 
thing going down, in my opinion.  However, I also acknowledge that 
people here may have different callings/messages/uses other than what 
I am hearing.  I am going to just follow where the path before me 
leads and try to find my role in it.

Personally, I think this needs to be in many people&#x27;s hands.  That&#x27;s 
an interest of mine, too.  Not sure yet how it will happen, but the 
radio hacks are a nice start.

&gt; I haven&#x27;t started box recording yet.  My impression of the EVP I&#x27;ve 
captured (which has been almost entirely obtained on the property I 
moved to six years ago) is that someone is attached to this place.  
The first message was &quot;Here come some people,&quot; as I was hiking up the 
hill one day with my goats, then a kill-you threat in the house, 
then &quot;get out of here&quot; in the barn.  I assumed it must be one of the 
original owners, and I still feel that it&#x27;s mainly one spirit 
communicating that this is their home, not mine.  I&#x27;ve gotten one 
uplifting message from what I believe to be the same entity, and this 
is also the last recording I&#x27;ve gotten.  I asked what death is like, 
compared to life: happy, beautiful, fulfilling--and specifically if 
death is less depressing.  The response was &quot;It&#x27;s everything.&quot;  
S/he/it basically stopped talking after that, and I stopped trying.  
I know this sounds weird, but I miss whoever or whatever it was.  I 
wonder if some of us might be better at dealing with the low-life 
stuck or grounded entities rather than the highly evolved technicians 
coming through the more sophisticated equipment.  I wonder where this 
is all going ultimately, other than to prove communication across the 
veil is possible.  I&#x27;m not an engineer or technologist on this 
physical plane, and I question what I have to offer this research 
since I&#x27;m so electronically challenged.  Meanwhile, the nurse side of 
me wants to heal and &quot;fix&quot; anyone needing help, even if they happen 
to be in the next world!  Do the guides and technicians ever 
acknowledge or make reference to the earthbound spirits, and if so, 
in what context?  Are we ever able to help unstick the stuck ones?  
Are we supposed to ignore them?

&gt;   EVP:
&gt; 
&gt;   Not that this is always the case, but EVP seems to primarily 
capture 
&gt;   lost people - ghosts being recorded, versus the box having the 
&gt;   ability to capture primarily what seems to be higher 
communication 
&gt;   from spirits, (and less of the lower communication - ghosts 
jumping 
&gt;   in).
&gt; 
&gt;   That to me is a huge difference... ;)

&gt;   &gt; I agree about the difference also. All that review time makes 
for a
&gt;   &gt; very tedious few hours. By the end of it you&#x27;re ready to pull 
your
&gt;   &gt; hair out. I&#x27;ve only done two sessions now and have gotten more
&gt;   &gt; positive results in 20 minutes time as I have in 10 years of 
EVP 
&gt;   research.

&gt;   &gt; &gt; Very interested. And I agree with you about the overnight 
&gt;   change. 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; Orgs like AA-EVP that aren&#x27;t dealing with the boxes are 
missing 
&gt;   the 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; boat.

&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; Well guys, I have to tell you that since I started box 
sessions 
&gt;   in
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; November I have become so spoiled that conventional EVP 
just 
&gt;   don&#x27;t do
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; it for me.
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; My organization was asked to come and do an investigation 
at a 
&gt;   very
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; historial place (here in Illinois). The owner of this home 
&gt;   asked if I
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; would bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed with 
the
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; immediately 2 way communication). So upon respectfully 
asking 
&gt;   my tec
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; if it was alright to do a session outside the my home we 
did 
&gt;   several
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; box sessions along with conventional EVP. We wanted to see 
if 
&gt;   we could
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; discover some unanswered history about the residence, and 
the 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; otherside
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; was more than willing to comply.
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; I have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were and 
are 
&gt;   the
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; most boring data to review. Something I use to love so much 
has
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; actually turned into a project given I am waiting for a 
response
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; immediately! Too funny how things can change overnight!
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; I will be uploading some files for these sessions if you 
are 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; interested.
