I got the same EVP on both\nmachines. Other people next to me did not get them. In other cases they got\nEVP and I, a couple feet away, got nothing on either machine. That was\nfascinating to me.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Tue, Nov 9, 2010 at 9:09 AM, Rick Wegrzyn &lt;rickwegrzyn@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been into the Paranormal for 33 years,and I agree about picking up\n&gt; different evps off multi digital recorders on a investigation,we even pick\n&gt; up responses off camcorders and not on recordesr.When using FB boxes # 77-#\n&gt; 80 we always use digital recorders/cams...We always get evps and recordings\n&gt; with out any of the FB boxes...When using the boxes brings a whole new\n&gt; aspect to responses.I have more luck on FM sweep,but the responses I get are\n&gt; just too unreal.Had a friend over a couple weeks ago and he &quot;Didn&#39;t believe&quot;\n&gt; in anything in this field,I asked the Q: Whats Al doing tomorrow?
