A  show that i had no knowledge of berading me a=
nd frank for an hour. At 
least  they could have had us on to defend oursel=
ves. Not knowing what we do 
at all,  most of what they said is based on co=
njecture and 100% false.

Listen  for yourself and see. David Rountree is a=
 huge piece of crap and 
adds nothing  to any field or life for that matter=
. If you see a picture of 
him, you would  want to punch him repeatedly....=
.at least that's how i feel.

Dr. Rorke  i thought was a good guy, but he's=
 no better than the other  
skepdickheads.
