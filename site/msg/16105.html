If we're talking about radiation as the transference through space of EMF, =
then yes it can effect equipment.=A0 The biggest example often cited is the=
 electromagnetic pulse put off by a nuclear blast, that can disable electro=
nic equipment.=A0 But even smaller events can do it: satellites have to be =
protected against certain radiation so their memory isn't zapped, etc.

So =
it depends on a lot of things: the type and sensitivity of the equipment; i=
ts environment; the types of radiation to which it is exposed; and its inte=
nsity and duration.=A0 

As a side note, remember something as benign as a =
magnet can royally screw up some electronic components as well.

Does anyone here know anything about 
radiation? In particularly if i=
t can cause electronic equipment to 
malfunction?

Thanks!
