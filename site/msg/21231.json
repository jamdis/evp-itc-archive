But when each steps up into the light, it&#39;s  \n&gt; like a little arched doorway, with three small steps going up, and a  small \n&gt; place to stand and kneel down, which is what they are all  asked to do before \n&gt; they go in when they are coming out  of the lower  plain.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Once they enter the light is when they can see that they are naked, it  \n&gt; might be one reason, He takes them in only one at a time, maybe.  Then  someone \n&gt; in the light covers or gives them a spirit rope to cover them up as they  \n&gt; come in, then after they meet with Jesus, and He talks to them for about 10  \n&gt; minutes our time, He wants everyone within the fold, but they must forgive  \n&gt; everyone that has ever hurt them plus be willing to make up for harm they \n&gt; did  while on Earth, and believe in what Christ did for them.  It is then \n&gt; where  they go to see the guardian angels, and the loved ones, and go to their  \n&gt; new homes.   In these two files, I hear, &quot;throw down pants&quot; in the other  \n&gt; one, I hear, &quot;we&#39;re naked!&quot;  &quot;me too.&quot;   If a person dies a  believer all \n&gt; ready, you don&#39;t need to go through that but, are already in the  light when one \n&gt; dies, there is no need to cross over because you are already  there so to \n&gt; speak.  At least that is the way Tech David describes things.  sf\n&gt;"}
