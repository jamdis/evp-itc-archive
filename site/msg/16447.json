As long as they are brave enough, and not prone to mental problems or extremely sensitive, I think it would be great if everyone could have the experience of knowing -- absolutely knowing without question -- that there is something else out there.  Sure, some negative stuff can happen, but think of the possibilities of what we could learn if everyone had one of these things.  I&#39;d think the positive would far outweigh the negative.  Either way, to say that the box should be in the hands of only a few, seems extremely arrogant to me.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.prrsociety.org/worldwideghostbox.html\n&gt; \n&gt;  None of these crackheads out there ever ask me anything,  any input, or\n&gt; technical advice. Always they want to act like the onlyest freaking\n&gt; worldwide experts with the box. Coletta will not even acknowledge an e-mail\n&gt; from me, guess he&#39;s afraid I&#39;ll contradict his expertness. Way too many of\n&gt; these presumptuous ego driven dorks out there on the web. All seeking the\n&gt; fame and fortune, not knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
