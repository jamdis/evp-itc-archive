I ran to get my digital camera and that started a \nyear long process of experiments and spirit images I name VPI (visual \nprojection imaging) I have literally hundreds of detailed images of \nspirits that where reflected through the crystal onto the walls in my \nhome. as far as I can discern the spirits were forming the images \ninside of the crystal window, and the sun was acting as sort of a \nslide or movie projecter. Projecting their images onto the walls when \nit came through the window.\n\nI had a page on I am haunted for the longest time, and drew quite a \nfollowing for my images. Alas since I discovered box research I have \nnot done one imaging session.\n\nWhat got my attention was the mention of the horse image. I also \ncaptured the image of a horse, very detailed and a cat that you would \nthink was sitting right in the room.\n\nMaragaret, please post the link to your site I did not get it and I \nwould love to take a look.\n\nIf anyone is interested let me know and I&#39;ll post some of my images.\n\nBruce"}
