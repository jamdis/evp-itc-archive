&gt; here is a link, I will not post out context info. but if this person cares
&gt; to visit this page, he or she will get the info needed, and it won&#x27;t &quot;pile
&gt; up&quot; in the list.  sf

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m generally in lurk mode due to some offline priorities that need my
&gt; immediate attention. I&#x27;ll probably be fairly silent through mid-July, but I
&gt; had to speak up when this email crossed my desk.
&gt;
&gt; While I don&#x27;t share Snowfire&#x27;s views in most cases, I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the
&gt; links &amp; banter. The recordings are always interesting... and isn&#x27;t that the
&gt; focus of this group?
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m not thrilled with ultimatums, as if the group isn&#x27;t big enough (or
&gt; big-hearted enough) to include diverse views, respectfully shared.
&gt;
&gt; My two cents: Snowfire, please don&#x27;t leave!
&gt;
&gt; In haste,
&gt; Fiona

&gt; &gt; I mean the stuff below, if you are so bothered by opinion, Billy? I will
&gt; &gt; leave, but the stuff in that statement below of yours, is very out of
&gt; &gt; context, to each is own. I was merely presenting something I came across
&gt; on the
&gt; &gt; You Tube, I don&#x27;t even know that person. Take care, sf
