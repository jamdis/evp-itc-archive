Frank, 
 
I would be very interested in seeing what A & E has to say about =
 Paranormal 
States.  From what I have seen of the show, and it has only be=
en  (2) 30 
minute episodes, it looked all staged.  And when the second epi=
sode  was done I sat 
there laughing my ass off at the results.  They didn'=
t  address the issues 
correctly and handle it anywhere near how it should =
of been  done.  I guess 
according to A & E that if we are talking to the s=
pirit  of the dead then WE are 
the problem and should stop it or atleast t=
hat is how  they addressed it.  Or 
is just how I see it?  But they do have=
 a lot  of nice toys to play with, I 
will give them that.  I think I would=
 much  rather watch a made-for-tv 
documentary on the haunted piano than wa=
tch another  episode of Paranormal 
States........LOL
