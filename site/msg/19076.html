Hi Everyone!

I recently purchased a modified RS 12-150 on eBay, and am try=
ing to discover who 
the person is who modified it. The story I got from th=
e seller is:

"I got possession of it at an investigation in PA, but it was=
 originally from 
NH. I did not use it because it is a lot bigger than the =
469 and I fly to 
investigations. It has been unused and what I was told is=
 that it was modified 
to sweep."
=A0
I'm attaching a photo of the signatur=
e that appears on the front=A0of the radio. 
Does anyone have any clue at a=
ll to who may have done the modifications? I have 
only used=A0it twice, bu=
t the=A0box is working well for me. Thanks in advance!

Jan
