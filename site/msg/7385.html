Hmm Michael I will try to answer some of you questions. Depends on what
rel=
igion you are is what you believe will happen when you die.  Yes there is
a=
 light that you go into to cross to the other side. As me having a near
dea=
th yes you see your loved ones and you also see your pets. Yes you can
see =
them in physical form. You will see them the way that you last
remembered t=
hem. I don't know about the food and the wine.  Traveling the
globe I feel =
you will be able to do if you wanted to. I suppose it would be
the same for=
 the moon and the planets and the oceans. =20

Our purpose is to help others and learn so we can take that to other
lifet=
imes. That is my belief. If you want to reincarnate I don't know the
proces=
s of that one I am sorry. =20

If you have any other questions I will try to answer them.
Hugs

Hi I am new to the group.  Now that you have your box, what type of
questi=
ons have you asked?  Like, "What happens when we die? Where do we go?
Is th=
ere a light? Do we meet with our loved ones, and can we see them in a
physi=
cal form as we did when we were in our bodies, or do we just see
light/ener=
gy and know it is them? After we see our loved ones, what happens
next? Can=
 we eat food there? Drink a nice glass of wine there? Enjoy a beer?
Travel =
the globe and see all the tourist attractions on the planet? Can we
travel =
and walk on the moon or other planets? Can we dive in the worlds
oceans, an=
d visit old shipwrecks? What is the purpose of our human life, and
can we r=
eincarnate again and how does that happen? I bet you are having a
ball with=
 that box. Please keep me in tuned to what you hear back.  Mike
Edwards, Ca=
ry NC...
