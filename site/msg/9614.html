&gt; Hi Nathan.  I always look to relevance as a key in determining
whether or not something is 
&gt; appropriate to the session.  If this were a hoax, I would then have
to seek an explanation 
&gt; for how private information is known by the &#x27;hoax perp&#x27;,
particularly information that 
&gt; would require visual awareness.  
&gt; 
&gt; Some of us have examples of appropriate responses being given when
asking things like, 
&gt; &quot;Can you name something nearby me?&quot; or &quot;Please tell me what I&#x27;m
holding in my left 
&gt; hand.&quot;  A sophisticated multi-transmission two way radio would not
explain answers 
&gt; which require &#x27;visual&#x27; information of some kind (though I&#x27;ll be the
first to admit my 
&gt; understanding of electronics is limited but I&#x27;m fairly confident on
this aspect.) 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, there is always the chance that the person running the
hoax is also, or in 
&gt; partnership with, an extremely talented remote viewer or psychic who
is able to glean that 
&gt; visual information from the ether or the mind of the experimenter.  
&gt; 
&gt; And what of those examples where people have confirmed the sound of
the voice being 
&gt; &quot;just like&quot; that of their loved one in spirit?  Surely the hoaxer
isn&#x27;t also able to mimic 
&gt; people&#x27;s loved ones.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are using EVP Maker with anything other than the allophones
file, which contains no 
&gt; words to begin with, you are also running the possibility of &#x27;false
positives&#x27; albeit they 
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t be from a hoax.  Again, I look to relevance to be key, and
relevant info that 
&gt; would not come easily to a stranger is even better.  
&gt; 
&gt; For example, I turned on my MiniBox for the very first time and
said, &quot;Hello?&quot; and 
&gt; immediately received the response, &quot;Hello Margaret.&quot;  If this were a
hoax, how could that 
&gt; person know in less than 10 seconds, who I was by name.  I had not
given this information 
&gt; out.  Not to mention that you have people experimenting 24/7 and
receiving similar 
&gt; responses.  How in the world could an organization have the
manpower, technology, or 
&gt; even the desire, to attempt such a hoax?  I mean that as a genuine
inquiry, because there 
&gt; might be an explanation I have not thought of.  
&gt; 
&gt; I have one example where, via radio sweep, my communicator was able
to correctly 
&gt; identify the status and location of a missing person (who it turns
out was alive and well, so 
&gt; we ended up with confirmation that the info given had indeed been
correct - which is 
&gt; much less complicated that trying to track and understand the clues
when associated with 
&gt; the dead, or missing but not found.)  Again, if a hoax, would that
have simply been a 
&gt; lucky guess on the part of the hoaxer?
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line for me is ... have I wondered if it could be a hoax?  Or
simply a fortuitous 
&gt; tuning of the dial?  Yes, on both accounts.  But there is enough
compelling evidence to rule 
&gt; out both of them as an explanation for the far too many relevant
examples received by so 
&gt; many of us.
&gt; 
&gt; Good food for thought, but after digesting it, I&#x27;d have to say, &quot;No,
a sophisticated hoax 
&gt; does not sufficiently explain the phenomena on a large scale.&quot;
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Has it ever occurred to you, that some one or
&gt; &gt; organisation, could be using a radio to say the things
&gt; &gt; you heard?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This whole radio and spirit voices, could be a MASSIVE
&gt; &gt; HOAX, perpetuated by some one with a sophisticated
&gt; &gt; multi-transmission two way radio.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Think about it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THAT IS WHY I USE EVPmaker only to commuincate with
&gt; &gt; the other dimension.
