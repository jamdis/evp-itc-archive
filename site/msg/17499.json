It seems like there is a lot of conversation between many voices here and they are talking about calling.  At .08, somebody is tee&#39;d off.  \n\nThere is something to labeling affecting subliminal interpretation.  When I read your interpretation of the &quot;jesus&quot; line at the beginning, that is what I heard through the speakers first and foremost.  I turned the speakers off and used studio grade headphones for analysis.  Voila, no Jesus.  I guess he was resurrected from this clip!  I often wonder if the sound waves between speaker and listener are manipulated in some way.  This is why I like to listen in enclosed headphones, that way your ear is directly against the sound source.\n\nThat said, this is what I hear from your clip:\n\n@.01: &quot;He&#39;s calling you, he&#39;s a (unclear)&quot; (male, electronic)\n@.03: It amounts to scheisse\n@.05: &quot;Make sure he has the date&quot; (male)\n@.06: &quot;May Eighteenth&quot; (electronic)\n@.08: &quot;Fuck this guy&quot; (male)\n@.09: Singing - &quot;He doesn&#39;t call her, call her (?anymore?)&quot; (female)\n@.12: He doesn&#39;t seem to reply (male)\n@.13: Steve (?Coogle? - unclear)\n\nI know you typically don&#39;t interact with the box by asking questions, but have you ever tried telling them to communicate one at a time?   It works for me most of the time when multiple voices crowd the box.  Regardless, they definitely like communicating with you.  I find the electronic voices and tones you get most interesting; they remind me of spiricom audio.\n\nTim\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  A 6 seconds &quot;make sure he has the date--the 17th&quot;, as two seem to talk back\n&gt; and forth. Yet another pick up date? I keep saying I still have stuff to do,\n&gt; but now the talk about using force.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Starts out &quot;he calls like I&#39;m Jesus..&quot; it gets head warping weird.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I really doubt these are acidental &quot;captures&quot;, as I don&#39;t have a set time\n&gt; to record.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Jun 3, 2010 at 3:49 PM, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hear that stuff too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  F-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   On Thu, Jun 3, 2010 at 1:42 PM, tim_woolworth &lt;tim@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have found that they do talk among themselves all the time. A lot of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; time, they are talking about me like I am not even there. In some of those\n&gt; &gt;&gt; clips, you can definitely hear them talking amongst themselves.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The main voice you hear (especially in clip 4) is my technician, or as I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; call him, my facilitator. He is the one telling Raudive to ask his question\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and telling an Other to wait. I have numerous clips where I will ask a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; question and I can hear him ask the same question of the Others. This is all\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the personal proof I need (besides my name and facts about my life coming\n&gt; &gt;&gt; through a broken radio). To hear your own words coming through the radio in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a different voice is something that should be considered impossible...but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; then to get an answer back from those reiterated words, well, I consider\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that pretty damn good evidence that there is an intelligence trying to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; communicate.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But then again, any scientist can easily say that I was experiencing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; nothing more that a Ham radio operator having fun at my expense. My only\n&gt; &gt;&gt; come back to this is that since I still a ghost hunter, I have traveled\n&gt; &gt;&gt; extensively to different locations. I have been bringing my box out in to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the field for location experiments. Guess what? My facilitator speaks in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; every spot, in every state that I have tried this in.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Tim\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, leongbabe@\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Tim,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for sharing your files - I heard a lot of different names in your\n&gt; &gt;&gt; clips Nos. 1-3, including the names Tim, Mark, and Steve; in clip No. 2,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sounded like they&#39;re mostly talking among themselves.
