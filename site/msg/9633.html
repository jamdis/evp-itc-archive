<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>2. Dangers which Mankind faces if SPIRICOM is not used wisely

Since his beginnings, Man has been faced with the fact that
individually and collectively he has the power to act for good or
evil. As his knowledge of the energetic nature of the cosmos has
expanded, Man has found that every energy so far identified -- from
sexual energy to atomic energy -- can be used for his benefit or for
his downfall. He will find that the energies involved in SPIRICOM are
also of a nature that can be used to help him grow mentally and
spiritually and become more God-like (that is more like the beings on
the higher planes) or they can be focused on trivia which will make it
even harder for him to grow out of the present deplorable mess in
which Western civilization&#x27;s social, economic and political actions
are tending toward disintegration.

----------------

    * For the spiritually oriented, we report some advice given by
high level spirit communicators: If SPIRICOM researchers adhere to the
following procedure they will not suffer possession by negative
forces. First thing in the morning say, &quot;I will wear the protective
cloak of the Christ light until I retire tonight.&quot; On retiring make a
similar decree for the night hours. (Note: The Christ light is said to
have overshadowed and inspired Jesus of Nazareth continually during
the last three years of his earth life.)

&gt; &gt; Just finished box number 3.  And yes that&#x27;s a trifield meter built in.
&gt; &gt;  It seems to work great.  Once the meter shows any EMF field at all
&gt; &gt; the box starts to spit out the allophones.  The meter also has a very
&gt; &gt; sensitive antenna and it is tied together with the
&gt; &gt;  A to D converter antenna that I use to get the emf into the box.
&gt; &gt; This is by far the most sensitive of the three boxes.  If you are
&gt; &gt; building your own just let me know if you need any info.  I will of
&gt; &gt; course upload audio files as I get them.  I did have a few headaches
&gt; &gt; with this box as I am driving the LM386 all the way up.  Somehow the
&gt; &gt; audio was getting back into the negative bus!  Took a couple hours to
&gt; &gt; get the right capacitor for the ground shunt.  Funny though as it
&gt; &gt; worked great on the breadboard but once I soldered it together
&gt; &gt; UHHHGGG.  I think I will hang onto this one  for a while.  I have
&gt; &gt; young lady in mind that is doing very promising work so I guess she
&gt; &gt; gets box # 1.
