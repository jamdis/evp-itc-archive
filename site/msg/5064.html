          Bruce,

In reply to your asking if there's a problem, etc., I clearly heard 
a "Yes" and then something following that which I can't make out.

Thanks for posting some unlabeled EVPs. I agree with you, if 
everyone, or most, people hear the same thing, then it's a general 
response meant to be public; otherwise, if only the researcher hears 
a particular remark, then it's most likely a personal EVP, meant for 
the researcher's ears alone.
