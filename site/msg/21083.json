You don&#39;t really need the echo chamber, I&#39;m not sure it serves a valid function.

I needed a 5v amplitude . One question about amplifier , i make a pre-amplifier for electret mic , i test it , and , many sound feedback appear . This problem will be solutionated when the mic is in the eccho chamber ? .... I will make whith 2 diameter`s tubes . Other question . I saw , there are a cork in eccho chamber . \n&gt; &gt; Why is used this cork ? . How put the mic in it ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
