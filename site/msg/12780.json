I can&#39;t \nprove it, and I can sometimes share the voices. Some of these voices \nare exceedingly deceptive--askking questions of them--pointless, and \nusually they don&#39;t answer me. There seems to be no universal rules, \nor knowledge on how this stuff works. \n\n I think there are an almost infinate number of levels, or maybe \ndemensions,  I think there is an almost infinate number of entities, \nsome spirit, some something else, many non-human. \n\n I think human spirit is not some deminished retard after death, \nstuck to some location, or object.\n\n There&#39;s a pattern of people that actually know how to make the stuff \nthat works-the spirit technology-they don&#39;t hang out on groups! Even \nI keep my group e-mail turned off. \n\n Frank--Sumption  I know it&#39;s lots of trouble, but google that name!"}
