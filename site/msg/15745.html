Lol I think we should stick a pin in this conversation. to be fair Frank on=
ly mentioned what he heard, at the end of the day any voices we get we just=
 report and say it how it is. you never know these voices could be fooling =
us, or are they could be=A0talking about another reality...lol are human br=
ains are too small to understand what is really going on. (i probably could=
 have picked a better term :-) ) in relation to the 15th, there was in fact=
 a big change in atrological terms which we all know is about planets, moon=
 bla de bla... and apparently atmospheric conditions do change slightly. th=
is period last till the 9th of spetmeber or i think 7oth october.... but st=
ill there was something that may be more significant to the voices then us.=
 

I dont know guys but lets just work together on this, I do honestly stil=
l think there was more to the 15th, being a complete old hat EVP experiment=
or I recieved quotes about the 15th of august on my Revox Reel to Reel, I d=
ont think the dates were specifically linked to something happening in the =
states as I live in the Cotswolds in the UK and I recieved voices about thi=
s. I gotta admit though I recorded a damn good voice yesterday which was ve=
ry clear...best so far (ill upload this soon as I get my revox connected to=
 Laptop) 

Its cool that you did question this but Frank was just saying wh=
at he heard,...has anybody else caught any interesting dates at all??

have=
 a good day all!
