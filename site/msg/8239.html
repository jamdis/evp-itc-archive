<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>If any reserachers in S. Cali that particiapte in the forum would 
like to experiment my Mind Mirror III EEG let me know. It&#x27;s designed 
to display brainwave frequency and state of conciousness. -Bill M

&gt; Regarding 7.83 hz comment by Ron Lenderer. I wouldn&#x27;t call it &quot;woo-
woo stuff&quot;. Try to reach 7.83 hz brainwave pattern while maintaining 
consciousness, a lot of odd things start to take place. The 7.8 hz 
frequency is also known as &quot;The Schumann resonance&quot;. I took a snippet 
of the explanation from wikipedia regarding the Schumann resonance 
for you: 
&gt; &quot;This global electromagnetic resonance phenomenon is named after 
physicist Winfried Otto Schumann who predicted it mathematically in 
1952. Schumann resonance occurs because the space between the surface 
of the Earth and the conductive ionosphere acts as a waveguide. The 
limited dimensions of the Earth cause this waveguide to act as a 
resonant cavity for electromagnetic waves in the ELF band. The cavity 
is naturally excited by energy from lightning strikes. Schumann 
resonance modes are observed in the power spectra of the natural 
electromagnetic background noise, as separate peaks at extremely low 
frequencies (ELF) around 7.8, 14.3, 20.8, 27.3 and 33.8 Hz.
&gt;  The fundamental mode of the Schumann resonance is a standing wave 
in the Earth-ionosphere cavity with a wavelength equal to the 
circumference of the Earth. This lowest-frequency (and highest-
intensity) mode of the Schumann resonance occurs at a frequency of 
approximately 7.8 Hz&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; A while back when reading about the schumann resonance I came up 
with an interesting idea. I wanted to find a brainwave eeg that would 
do a tone biofeedback into an ear piece (right ear), then have the 
7.8 hz tone being played infinitely through an ear piece in the left 
ear, and try to force myself to match my brainwaves to the schumann 
resonance through force of will. Having the real time feedback in 
tone form would drastically help to judge where one is at and if 
he/she is having any success changing his/her brainwaves. The idea is 
to passively listen while relaxing until one could get to the 
schumann resonance regarding the brainwaves and record the 
sensations/thoughts/experiences etc.. I haven&#x27;t the time nor money to 
get a biofeedback eeg and actually give this a try, but for anyone 
who does and decides to let me know your results.

listening to C2C a few days ago and the person being interviewed 
mentioned that the frequency 7.83 hertz (not MH) is the common 
frequency where the mind goes when it between theta and alpha states 
and this 7.83 frequency is sort of a trance state that links mind and 
universe.  Is this just woo-woo stuff?  Would you think it has any 
relevance to EVP communications?   waddayathink    Ron L
