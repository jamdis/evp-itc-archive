And my story (read excuse) for not commenting on your posts:  I'm the guy who lives in Mexico, drove four hours to get a RS radio to hack and then trashed the radio.   Since then I have been reading your posts and ALL others with great interest...but mostly with envy because I have not been able to record anything myself.   I am trying however.  For example, last night for about four hours I tried another time to use a combination of radio voice recordings processed through the EVP Maker program which I played back through my computer via amplified speakers, with a mic and digital recorder.  Since I don't have a hacked radio tuner I also tried recording by manually scanning with a radio...felt pretty silly...but gave it a try to no avail.  Maybe you or someone else has a suggestion of what simple technology I can attempt until I get back to the U.S. this month or next to buy what I need.
   
  Besides maintaining my family, work, and day-to-day living responsibilities,  I attempt to review all posts of this group and I conduct my primative EVP tests.  I trust you and other members will continue with your worthy investigations.  You are all inspirational to me.   Ron l
   
  But Bruce, know that if this group and posts as excellent as yours did not exists I would have little, if any, motivation to pursue EVPs.  For many reasons I believe it is important for me to continue this pursuit.  I hope you and other group members have patience with us laggers.

          But ,

yesterday I posted like 20 files and did not recieve one reply on any 
of them.

Yet a post about a broken cell phone recieves a hundred replies.
What is this group about?

Frank is right what the hell is the sense of posting files to an EVP-ITC
group if no one pays attention to the evp's or files that are posted.

I admit I do not reply to every single post myself but I do try and 
reply to most.

If no one is even bothering to listen to the files you are really 
missing what this is all about.

Come o9n guy's this is supposed to be about the exchange of ideas and 
constructive suggestions on evp-itc research. It's not a chat board or 
a forum for personal vendeta's

Let's get with the program and do some evp work.

And I'll bet I get some replies to this post that's for sure !

Bruce
