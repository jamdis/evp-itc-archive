These investigators are \nsuch paranormal experts that they consitently ignore what the \ninventor of the box says. I made the damn thing, it works, I \nobvioulsy know how it works and how to make it, yet they ignore what \nI say. That&#39;s this weekend, BTW. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  If the boxes, both mine and ones made by others worked for these \npeople you&#39;d see the voices posted everywhere on the web, instead the \nyou get &quot;oh, we had to send that off to be anayzed&quot;, what a crock! \nAll these people are doing is trying to jump on Moon&#39;s bandwagon. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Perhaps Moon&#39;s statement on his site that I don&#39;t with any groups \nwas pre-cognitive. I think that&#39;s a good idea. These \ngroups/investigators tend to have preconcieved ideas about what the \nevidence consists of, and ignore anything that doesn&#39;t fit into that. \nYeah, that&#39;s scientific all to hell.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Climb to the top of the charts!

It \nseems someone who&#39;d be dedicated in doing their own &quot;independant&quot; \nResearch then writting about it or doing Low-Cost demos. of the box \n(now & then) would be a better way to go with these boxes  . . . and \nof course the 1st thing to mention is WHO the maker IS; Mr. Frank \nSumption!!!  My 2c worth, here!     =Judy=  P.S. I look at what other \nPioneers have done with EVP&#39;s & ITC&#39;s!!!"}
