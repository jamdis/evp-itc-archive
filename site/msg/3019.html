<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You have been a member of this group since 2004 and still have no 
idea what it&#x27;s about ? As far as me not watching ghost shows on tv, 
it seems by your explanation of how you have been involved in the PI 
field that you are a lot like those cheesy ghost hunting shows. To 
make a statement that spirits are not interactive and could care less 
about us or what we are trying to do, that alone shows you know 
nothing. I am a disabled rescue worker injured in the 911 attacks and 
am home all day with plenty of time for research and I can 
imphatically tell you that they do pay attention they do interact 
they are definitely interested and they are working harder than we 
are to communicate. 

maybe you have formed your opinion because in your vast wealth of 
knowledge and experience you have never come across a spirit that was 
interested in you. besides throwing you all around a room or lifting 
you into the air and hurling you like a shot put or whatever you 
claim some ghosts did. And if they did do that to you that sounds 
pretty interactive to me. I can see why they would want to throw you 
around and kick and bite you but if I where you I would find another 
hobby.
and I say hobby because by your analogy of it that&#x27;s all it is to you.

As far as your friend with the mini box, yeah I&#x27;m not stupid I 
figured that out, you can stop trying to defend it no one here is 
gonna buy that piece of crap.

I will not trade any more malicious posts with you so don&#x27;t bother.
