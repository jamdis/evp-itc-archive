<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I usually feel pretty tired at the end of those 36 and 48 hour ham radio 
contests, but very rarely does something drain me after 10 minutes.

I know people have experienced ghosts robbing the energy from their 
batteries, etc. particularly when an area seems very active.  I wonder in 
this case if whoever or whatever is producing the sounds in the boxes can 
actually get some of your body&#x27;s energy to use?

&gt; because of this.  Please remember I run marathons and have been a ham
&gt; for over 20 years so I can listen to the radio for hours on end.  I am
&gt; not certain why this is happening. Just wondering if anybody has this
&gt; problem.
