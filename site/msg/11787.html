The Fish Group--a group of entities that seem to get great pleasure form s=
crewing wiht EVPers. Just when you think you're getting great evidiecne and=
 proo, it turns out to be these tricky jokers. Another reason not to take e=
verything a gospel truth.  I think it was thoise researchers in Luxemberg(?=
) that first got these guys, but I don't remeber for sure. So if you hear a=
ny reference to fish, that's a clue that they are there. I am uncertain if =
they are bad guys, or just tricksters.  Frank-S
