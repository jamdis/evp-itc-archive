Again, not believing everything people tell me is not calling them a liar. =
It is wanting to hold out judgment, either way, until I can find some proof=
 for myself.=C2=A0 Which is what I am trying to do here, reading the group,=
 and running tests.

One test is to catalog predictions, and measure result=
s.=C2=A0=C2=A0 The prediction was posted by Frank, so that is how I catalog=
 it.=C2=A0 That is not making insults.

      I never quoted you. I was making the point that when you make state=

his group have gotten during their sessions. If you listen to them, the res=

As an example, Frank related the contents of a session . I don=

<d=

build up a list of failed predictions so you can tout it out all over the w=
eb and make a name for yourself. There are some here that suggest you be ki=
cked off the group cuz you contribute nothing, can't do any recordings of y=
our own, can't hear any of the EVPs, can't see any of the images, yet are q=
uick to criticize and test everyone else. </div>
