<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No, the reason they put the mute function in while scanning is because
most people couldn&#x27;t stand the &quot;bleep-blop-bloop&quot; while the radio
scanned without the mute.

&gt;  Hi Frank, do you think the electronics people knew about the voices?  Could
&gt; that be the reason they made the radios to scan in silence...I wonder? .sf

&gt;  Many, maybe most of these &quot;digital&quot; radios are actually analog tuners that
&gt; are voltage tuned. So instead of removing the tuner, as these are large
&gt; boards, just add a sweep board. It&#x27;s the same thing Hultay does. It has the
&gt; advange of much better sound, since you&#x27;re using he amplifiers and speakers
&gt; that it was designed with. This also has the built in tape deck.
&gt;
&gt;   The radio is kind of a crap shoot, as some are all digital, and the tuner
&gt; is tuned with software, usually IC-to-IC(ICsquared) a language put out by
&gt; Philips. Some car tuners use this, and I even had a couple Arm Band radio
&gt; that are all digital tuning.

&gt;  That&#x27;s wild, Frank!
&gt;
&gt;  I admit to having a very limited scope and knowledge of electronics in
&gt; general and how these things are built and actually function specifically,
&gt; but still, opening them up and showing us &quot;the works&quot; like this just boggles
&gt; my mind.
&gt;
&gt;  Thanks for doing what ya do, lol!

&gt;  Converting an AM/FM/Cassette/CD player is great. I like it, I like it.

&gt;        AM/FM/Cassette/CD boom box. With an added board for linear, random
&gt; and manual sweep, built 9/2008. It was sweeping out of band on FM, so I
&gt; added a control to set the sweep limits on the back panel, and a linear rate
&gt; control on the side.
