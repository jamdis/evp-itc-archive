But everything else I have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; heard so far in the files here is not striking me as the voice of any\n&gt;&gt; &gt; apparition, due to the weakness of quality.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If you&#39;re still reading this, I have to tell you I have had striking\n&gt;&gt; &gt; results in my own home, simply letting a recording device roll, and if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you&#39;re not yet interested in hearing these samples, I guess you&#39;re\n&gt;&gt; &gt; more into the box than the afterlife and that&#39;s YOU, not me! :)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; LOVE,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Katherine.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Checked by AVG - http://www.avg.com &lt;http://www.avg.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Version: 8.0.169 / Virus Database: 270.6.21/1671 - Release Date: \n&gt;&gt; 9/14/2008 7:16 AM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
