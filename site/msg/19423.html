Interesting files, Frank!
=C2=A0
I hear them 95% the same as you (for what =
it's worth) and just a few things a little differently. 
=C2=A0
In my revie=
ws I got the following:
=C2=A0
1). "We're coming with broken ships, with no=
 supplies to get back home..."
=C2=A0
2). "We're coming, Sumption, at the e=
nd."
=C2=A0
3). "Just a little prayer...that would help us (out)."
=C2=A0
4=
). "It's got something else...
=C2=A0
The first clip sounds like it has a f=
ew words tacked on the end of the message saying=C2=A0"with no supplies to =
get back home." 
=C2=A0
Am I crazy or does anyone else hear this too? 
=C2=
=A0
It sounds like they're landing here and burning the ships behind them. =
Maybe it's a "one-way ticket" type-mission=C2=A0for better or worse?=C2=A0 =

P.S. I've been (re) watching the History Channel's=
 documentaries on "Ancient Aliens" & the Ancient Astronaut Theory. If you g=
uys (and gals) haven't seen them, I highly recommend checking these program=
s=C2=A0out via Youtube, "On Demand"=C2=A0or Google Video perhaps. These rea=
lly are some of the most incredible,=C2=A0thought-provoking, fantastically =

dence (volumes=C2=A0upon volumes of=C2=A0solid PROOF, undeniable EVIDENCE=
=C2=A0and hard FACTS that all supports this theory) it all seems so damn ob=
