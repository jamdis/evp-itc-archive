Your welcome. You dont need a class Amy. I know how frustrating it can be. When I first started the others would help me too. Then "they" sent me on a wild goose chase one day sending me a message for someone in the group and said give this to Paul. I sent it, he only heard static. So I used a new program I had just run across called clear voice denoiser and in the process of playing with his file I found some settings which solved all of my cleaning up problems. Plus it uncovered other voices I couldnt hear before. Thus the "paul" filter was born
   
  I would literally get headaches at the end of all of my sessions by trying to figure out how to clean them. Once I lucked upon the right filters, havent had a headache since. They also gave some hints for what settings to use a few times but I didnt understand what they meant until later.
  
 
  To get ya started heres the paul filter. I usually set it under options to amplify X 15.
   
  I am also sending some of the other filters (paul2 paul3 mistyxx) because after they had me play with some settings I realized sometimes those multilayer voices have other voices you cant hear underneath them. Just download them and save them then once you have clear voice denoiser installed just stick them in the denoiser folder with the rest of its filters. You will then be able to use them once you start the program it will list them under "professional" when you click that button.
   
  Alot of people dont think using filters is good. They want all of thier evp's to be "class A" or they wont even bother with it. I on the other hand never go for the class A type, even tho now and then I get them and I am happy to have gotten it, I use the system I set up with those on the other side as the "norm" because they go by these guidelines now too. I still only record for 30 seconds which is just right for the demo of Clear Voice. And they pack alot into that 30 seconds so the multilayers are at different speeds now rather than they all talk at once I slow it down to -74 in audacity to hear some of my groups messages. I also asked them to speak one at a time and they now try and do that rather than a room full of people all speaking at once.
   
  I know this was a private email, but only because it was too large to send all the files to group. I am now sharing the filter part with the group in case anyone else wants them.
