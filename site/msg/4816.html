 I have the '470, but I don't know if it's the older one or not. I was abl=
e to modify it, but it was somewhat different than in the video instruction=
, there was more than one green wire. You have to lift the top board so you=
 can see the wire connections on the other board, they are labeled, and you=
 can tell what wire to cut/unsolder.  (mute wire).
