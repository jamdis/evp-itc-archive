<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ursula and Misty  thank you very much for your feedback.  I 
really appreciate you taking the time to listen, and for the 
comments, especially noting the dual layers of speech.  Interesting.  
     Frank S. - Thanks for the recent files from EVPmaker - nice!  
There hasn&#x27;t been much discussion regarding EVPmaker lately, so I 
wasn&#x27;t&#x27; sure if it was a viable tool to use.  I haven&#x27;t read many 
older posts, but hope to get caught up during the holidays.  Have you 
or others considered modifying speech synthesis software to generate 
random sounds?  I wonder how something like that would work
   On the 16th I did three 3minute recordings and got 9 clips from 
them.  In this session, I was asking questions regarding a knocking 
sound I heard while going to sleep or waking up about 12 years ago.  
My life situation wasn&#x27;t the best at that time.  It was always three 
knocks, and once a doorbell, but not the doorbell for where I was 
then living.  Started the Knocking session by telling &quot;Rick&quot; that I 
got messages from previous session, got &quot;Well, he&#x27;s got patience!&quot; 
for response.  Then was told, &quot;Aye, it smells in here.&quot;  Next asked 
them what sound did I hear back then, and got &quot;it was knocking (maybe 
nothing?)&quot;    The best one so far is; &quot;Our earthbound forefathers are 
video programs.&quot;  A second voice keeps repeating &quot;Ent&quot; syllable 
during this one.  I have put these files in a new folder called 
Knocking, which is under Laptop MP3s.   More comments there.  
	I&#x27;m making progress on getting the software needed to do 
linear scanning with the Radio Shark 2 USB am/fm radio and hope to 
have it up and running within the next week or two.  
Thanks again to all
Willy</pre>
