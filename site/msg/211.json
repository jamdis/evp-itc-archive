I&#39;ve had luck using this method.  But I think the wa=\r\nrning has to do with skeptics.  Interestingly,  I posted this evp on a mess=\r\nage board when I received it back in December and got a lot of slack from a=\r\n chic on the board.  She was the biggest Witch (a moderator too), because s=\r\nhe did not get any results herself.  I honestly don&#39;t care, who believes me=\r\n or not. So this could have been a warning in regards to her.   BTW, your h=\r\nubby will be more accepting in time, just give him time.  Bri is a lot more=\r\n open, especially after going to that cemetery in Ohio. Although, lol he sa=\r\nid he would never go with me again.  He has a different belief system then =\r\nI do, and I respect that.\n\nJody\n\n\nOriginally received December 10, 2005-not=\r\nes below\n\nMy little guy was using the computer and I thought I&#39;d meditate..=\r\n lol but can&#39;t find the cd I like so I turned on the radio in my room to us=\r\ne the cd player.. it no longer works not sure why cause we rarely use it.  =\r\nSo I&#39;m sure this is boring you.  But I got an idea to test with the radio a=\r\ngain.  I&#39;m bored housework is done and my little guy is using the pc so he =\r\ndoesn&#39;t need me.  \n\nThey are telling me that this method is not going to be=\r\n accepted by the others.  Whomever the others may be.  I had the radio betw=\r\neen a sports broadcast and another channel.   I amplified this 50%\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_001_001A_01C6A0FC.30E5D810\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.2912&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I agree=\r\n but if it is them that are not willing to \ntalk that way then there is not=\r\n much I can do.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had luck using this \nmethod.&nbsp; But I think t=\r\nhe warning has to do with skeptics.&nbsp; \nInterestingly,&nbsp; I posted th=\r\nis evp on a message board when I received it \nback in&nbsp;December&nbsp;an=\r\nd got a lot of slack from a chic on the \nboard.&nbsp; She was the biggest W=\r\nitch (a moderator too), because she did not \nget any results herself.&nbsp;=\r\n I honestly don&#39;t care, who believes me or not.
