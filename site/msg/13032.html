Greetings=
 fellow researchers,

I've been out-of-pocket for the last week, visiting t=
he Washington DC
area and attending a 4 day conference where many high powe=
red people in
that kind of business who gave some interesting briefings. Lu=
cky for
me... I was in attendance and got to meet and listen to those who w=
ear
lots of stars or are appointed to positions of our Nation's power base.=

Unfortunately, the conference wasn't about EVP, ITC, or spirit
communicati=
on. But, who knows... maybe someday they (at the top) will
hold a conferenc=
e like that.

Anyway... I wanted to give an update on my latest direction f=
or those
who e-mailed me or messaged me while I was on the east coast last =
week.
First... I'd like to thank that documentary production company for
co=
ntacting me, asking about the use of my prototypes, but I have to
respectfu=
lly decline your offer as I only do this for my own research,
providing the=
 information FREE to all who desire to built there own
devices. And after h=
aving been led astray by a not-to-be-named
paranormal radio show venue abou=
t a certain Stanley Hotel conference,
I'm a bit gun-shy at getting involved=
 with such ventures. Also, for
those who wrote and asked about me selling p=
roducts, I don't build and
sell anything. I just provide FREE information f=
or my fellow
researchers.

Okay... on with my story.
While sitting in my ho=
tel room last week I continued to read one of
Sarah Estep's books. In one o=
f the chapters she writes about the plane
crash into the Potomac River, whi=
ch happened a number of years ago. Many
people died when the airplane went =
into that frozen river, and she
explains how she and others began receiving=
 messages from the crash
victims at almost the exact time time crash occurr=
ed, even though she
didn't know about the crash at the time.

She then writ=
es about the crash of two jumbo jets, where hundreds lost
their lives insta=
ntly, or soon after the accident. And how the spirit
world was filled with =
communication because of this large disaster.

That got me thinking...

I t=
oo have always been super sensitive about deadly plane crashes,
feeling for=
 the families of the victims, as well as, and especially for
the victims th=
emselves.

One crash in particular put me into the extensive research mode =
about
the crash and the victims. So-much-so that I contacted the wife of th=
e
plane's pilot, where I was able to help put some closure into her world
a=
fter a number of contacts. (Not wanting to discuss too much, let me
just sa=
y I was able to view things she was not allowed to view. And
after doing so=
 I was able to describe things to her that she always
wondered about.)

The=
 commercial aircraft in question crashed so violently that remains of
the p=
assengers were never all recovered. And after years of legal
battling, the =
settlements were made and the entire aircraft wreckage was
released to a sa=
lvage company.
I was there, at the warehouse, when the many trucks left wit=
h the many
pieces of plane, enroute to their salvage yard. And while there =
I
talked with the attorney and investigative lead, who were both on-scene
t=
o over-see the finalization of this effort.

To get off topic for a bit, I =
for one am of the opinion that in the
spirit communication world, an object=
 is key if communication with a
specific entity is desired. I know many do =
not agree, and think that
open communication is possible anytime, anywhere.=
.. but I'm not one of
those people.

I may be wrong or I may be right, but =
I think an object or location are
a must when specific communication is des=
ired. hence, the reason I stand
next to a certain grave site, or location w=
here a death actually
happened, or have a related object in hand or near wh=
ere a session is
being done.

Okay... having said that, while I was observi=
ng the movement of the
plane crash debris, I was offered a small piece or t=
wo by those who now
owned the salvage material. (No longer in litigation an=
d no longer owned
by the airline company). I refused acceptance of anything=
 at the time,
but asked if the salvage company had, by chance, forgotten so=
mething in
the warehouse or on the grounds, was it okay for a person to pos=
sess it.
They told me, yes.

Later that evening, when all the material had =
been moved out of the
warehouse, I once again visited the scene. Looking ar=
ound I found they
had done a very good job at clean-up, only leaving a few =
pieces of small
metal, wire, paper, and fabric near the large doors.

I pic=
ked up the few items that were still there and headed toward the
large tras=
h container that was on the property, my intensions to drop
those items int=
o the trash. But, while holding them I received a very
strong feeling, a ve=
ry emotional sensation that would not allow me to
put them in the trash. It=
 was so strong in-fact, that I began crying. 
It just flowed through me, co=
nsuming me as it went.

My emotional feeling was just like it had been earl=
ier in the day when I
placed one hand on one of the engines that were mangl=
ed and filled with
impacted dirt that was once the ground in the place that=
 became the
final resting place.

Once I arrived home, I carefully placed t=
he small amount of debris
material (metal, wire, carpet fabric, paper, etc.=
) into a sealed glass
canister, where it remains to this day.

Where am I g=
oing with this story...???

Two weeks from now, I have a two week vacation =
coming... which will be
spent at home.

After reading Sarah Estep's book, e=
specially the chapter about the plane
crash victims, I've decided to use th=
ose objects I acquired from the
warehouse grounds, as the objects that may =
help me make some specific
spirit contacts.
I have already researched that =
crash, and I have all the victims names,
along with some information of the=
re life's. Maybe I will be able to
gain information and answer some questio=
ns... so I can contact others,
besides the original contact with the pilot'=
s wife, as I told you about
earlier in my writing.

All I can do is try... =
and see what happens.
