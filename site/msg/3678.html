 This was from what I recorded Thursday, befeor the threat, or whatever. I=
 don't agree with how Chris uses the boxes, but he may hear a different lev=
el that I do, or.. I don't hear waht he does, and he doesn't hear what I do=
, but that's pretty much the same ofr everyone. Chrsi has some "cherrished"=
 theories, I guess they'd be called, about how the bopxes work, I have no i=
dea how it works.Chris thinks the box use should be restricted, I think it =
should be open to all. Other than that we agree.
