 The Spiricom supposedly used 13 tone gnerators to simulate the tones of h=
uman speech, then transmitted that over a CB, or 29 mhz carrier so the spir=
its could modulate the tones. If I understood the small amount of reading I=
've done on the system.  Curiously,  no ones seems to be able to get it to =
works, but, it seems no on can my box schematics to work either. 
 
 The "R=
oboBox" uses a speech sythesizer chip, which produce tones and modualtions =
that approximate human speech, but it also puts out the various other sound=
 effects like R2-D2, and various chirps and whistles, as I don't program th=
e chip for speech only. This first attempt is just accessing the Speakjet w=
ith  random pulses from the old random voltage generator I've used in the b=
oxes. I use an adapter to convert the white noise to random digital pusles =
that the Speakjet can process. 
 
 The spirits seem to use all the sounds a=
nd noise to make voices, so eliminating all ofthe noise might limit access =
to a certain range, or higher entities.
