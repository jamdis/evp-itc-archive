i have read many accounts that state evp sessions work better when you are =
clear and focused. ( meditative) =A0I dont think it matters who you ask for=
- its your preferences, ( in my opinion)- if you want to talk to a departed=
 loved one, it is fine to ask for them, but if they dont show up right away=
 dont be discouraged. Also, in my own personal experience, If you ask for '=
just anybody'=A0 then that is exactly who youll get! ( lol)

Also...

Is there any way to "prepare" for recording like light a candle, =

meditate, etc? I am thinking maybe when I start sessions I can light a 
ca=
ndle and when I end them I can blow the candle out kind of like a 
signal.

My grandfather- in-law and my father-in-law have both passed, should I 
tr=
y and ask for them by name or should I ask for anyone available? 

Sorry fo=

Thanks!
