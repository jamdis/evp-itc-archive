            It=

ou have to look at the big picture and decide if it's worth the frustration=

            Even dropping al=

ve the side effect of letting all the negativity and egos out there burn th=
emselves out, so if you do look back into things a while down the road, it =
could be a prettier picture then.

            Other than a full retreat, I=
 don't think anything else would make a difference other than a full attack=
: creating, for  instance, good objective standards for evaluation and test=
 of the technology and results, which the shows and 'experts' seem to find =
anathema.  Then, if their claims were to be confronted by such standards, t=

          Thanks Rick! You seem to have put alot of thought and time into t=
hat. 

                         What really bothers me is the self proclaim=

                         I don't do gh=

hing more than something trying to get someone's attention. It's these expe=

such as the "Haunting In CT", these same experts will proclaim is based on =
fact, when the facts are probably nothing more than your creaking floors, j=
ust to make the whole paranoramal field dark and demon filled. In my case, =
fear does not sell, I won' watch those movies. 

                         I=

hers.  Trouble is, it's like talking on a phone or radio, how do you know w=

       That is an interesting observation. I think the core of the issue is=
 that there seems to be a `sweet spot' in paranormal beliefs where there is=
 just enough science, just enough technical backing, just enough paranormal=
 claims, and just enough indefinite evidence that keeps people interested i=
n the ghost hunting mentality

                          Evidence which bec=
omes too indefinite turns off most people. As they become more aware of sen=
sitives who simply make claims ("I feel there is a GHOST here!"), but provi=

y, people eventually grow tired of the anthropomorphism of every little occ=
urrence in a house: a creak implies a footstep, which implies a person, whi=
ch, if not seen, implies a ghost. But a creak does not equal a footstep.

 =
                         And while this kind of indefinite evidence can los=
e an audience, so can evidence that is claimed to be "obviously" evident by=
 technology. Here, the investigator is no longer making vague claims, but w=
aving science around, like FLIR cameras, or EMF meters, and then making pro=
clamations of the results. But again, people eventually see these are just =
lights and sounds from electronics, and investigators making more claims. I=
t's like the psychics again, but with visual aids.

                       =
   I think the reason EVP studies are not securing more interest, as you no=
ted, are a little of both effects. First is the anthropomorphism problem: I=
 notice many EVP experimenters proclaim what their results sound like, or n=
ame the sound file by what they've heard. But like the creaks, "sounds like=
" does not equal "is". This is then compounded by the technology backing: r=
egardless of how valid the EVP researcher's results are, the technology can=
 seem intimidating, but the researchers often proclaim the obviousness of t=
heir results. People again become turned off by it because it is not obviou=
s to them, and in the end it is just another piece of technology presenting=
 sounds, with no obvious connection to the paranormal, except by the claims=
 and interpretations of the presenters.

                          I believ=
e, taking these issues into account, there is a way for EVP studies to garn=
er more interest. For now, the analysis coming from the researchers usually=
 seems like a claim, and it is these claims, imho, that is being classified=
 by the public with the rest of the paranormal claims, and so, it also beco=
mes less of an interest. A new approach could be one without the claims and=
 interpretations of the investigators, one where the sounds are simply play=
ed and not labeled. The interpretation of the data could be left to the lis=
teners. Web sites which present EVPs could be developed where people could =
not see others interpretations until they entered their own. I think this w=
ould be such a novel approach, that it would give the public a better feeli=
ng of true involvement in the research, and feel less like they are simply =
being exposed to the claims of others. And I think that feeling of involvem=
ent is what is needed to reignited the public interest here.

rimenters proclaim what their

, or name the sound file by what

But like the creaks, "sounds like" does 
                          not equa=
l "is". This is then compounded by the 
                          technolog=
y backing: regardless of how valid the EVP 
                          resea=
rcher's results are, the technology can seem 
                          int=
imidating, but the researchers often proclaim the

  obviousness of their results. People again become

    turned off by it because it is not obvious to them, 
                  =
        and in the end it is just another piece of technology 
            =
              presenting sounds, with no obvious connection to the

                   paranormal, except by the claims and interpretations 
  =
                        of the presenters.<BR><BR>I believe, taking these 
=
                          issues into account, there is a way for EVP studi=
es to 
                          garner more interest. For now, the analysi=
s coming 
                          from the researchers usually seems like=
 a claim, and 
                          it is these claims, imho, that is =
being classified by

the paranormal claims, and 
                          so, it also becomes l=

                          approach could be one =
without the claims and 
                          interpretations of the in=
vestigators, one where the 
                          sounds are simply pla=
yed and not labeled. The 
                          interpretation of the d=
ata could be left to the

 could not see others 
                          interpretations until they=
 entered their own. I think

rch, and feel less like they are simply

posed to the claims of others. And I think

feeling of involvement is what is needed to
