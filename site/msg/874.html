Hi Misty, thanks for the great feedback! Some of the messages on reverse playback are very clear. This one might be one of Frank&#x27;s guys looking in.
&quot;Circuit made manual&quot;
Thanks again,
Dave

Wow Dave cool evp. Whats really cool is when I reverse that it says &quot;your in the zone&quot;
   
  plug a million hertz
  your in the zone
   
  Thats what I hear. That actually has reference for something Laura and I were talking about recently so thanks for the &quot;plug&quot; and sharing that!

I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning system. I tried several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner through the AM band late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the dial moving at a constant rate of speed. This is not nearly as good as Frank&#x27;s &#x27;hands off&#x27; random tuning method but it still produced some results. What impressed me most is that some of the voices sound the same, even though I tuned through several channels. This attached capture could be a technical message.
&quot;Plug a million hertz&quot; One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which is close the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.
