Though I posted audio in .wav files, they actually seem \npretty small in file size.  I do not have time to convert these and \nwonder if they are OK the way they are?  \n\nPlease advise...  :)\n\nLC\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Misty&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all. It&#39;s that time again for me to remind you that the group \n&gt; is low on space (96% used) and actions will be taken. For now \nrather \n&gt; than delete everyones files I am asking that you convert your wav \n&gt; format into mp3 or smaller format before you post them to the files \n&gt; area.\n&gt; \n&gt; One member using 10+ megs out of our groups 100 total megs just \nisnt \n&gt; going to fly anymore. So starting in May all files that are not \n&gt; within size limits and arent in smallest formats will have to start \n&gt; to get deleted.\n&gt; \n&gt; For those who cant convert your files I have programs that are free \n&gt; to help you do that. For those that dont want to convert your \nfiles, \n&gt; you can use esnips to post your larger files and share them with \nthe \n&gt; group as links in posts. For those that ignore my posts and do what \n&gt; you want to anyway, your stuff will be deleted and your option to \n&gt; upload and share here in group will be disabled.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said we have 100 (one hundred) megs total in file section for \n&gt; sharing, please do not abuse your share of that space. As you can \nsee \n&gt; there are others who like to share too. Eventually we may just \nclean \n&gt; it out of everyones files but for now lets try and stick to \n&gt; compacting the things we upload and make use of places like esnips \n&gt; for sharing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt;"}
