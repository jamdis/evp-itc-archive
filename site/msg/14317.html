<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m sorry if I hit some kind of nerve, but it was really just a simple question, and I&#x27;m sure you can understand why the rumor would arouse curiosity.  There&#x27;s no need to head anything off on my account, and as you said, he can speak for himself if he likes.  Though, because of the tone of your response, I hope he does address it now, to clear up any ideas which your reaction might have engendered.

&gt; Look guys don&#x27;t read anything into it. Frank and Chris have had a &quot;on again, off again&quot; relationship as long as they have known each other. I normally don&#x27;t speak up for Sumption, he is quite capable of speaking for himself but I thought I would head this off before imaginations got away from you all. 
&gt; 
&gt; If he wants you to know his business he will let you know. I feel you overstep your bounds to expect an explanation.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,

&gt; 
&gt; I noticed on Chris Moon&#x27;s Myspace blog he posted:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;People also have a misconception that Mr. Sumption and I are at war which is not true. As a matter of fact we have tentative plans for a joint research project this fall.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe Frank could shed some more light on this partnership?
