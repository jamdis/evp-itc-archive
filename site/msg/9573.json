And yes that&#39;s a trifield meter built in.\n It seems to work great.  Once the meter shows any EMF field at all\nthe box starts to spit out the allophones.  The meter also has a very\nsensitive antenna and it is tied together with the\n A to D converter antenna that I use to get the emf into the box. \nThis is by far the most sensitive of the three boxes.  If you are\nbuilding your own just let me know if you need any info.  I will of\ncourse upload audio files as I get them.  I did have a few headaches\nwith this box as I am driving the LM386 all the way up.  Somehow the\naudio was getting back into the negative bus!  Took a couple hours to\nget the right capacitor for the ground shunt.  Funny though as it\nworked great on the breadboard but once I soldered it together\nUHHHGGG.  I think I will hang onto this one  for a while.  I have\nyoung lady in mind that is doing very promising work so I guess she\ngets box # 1."}
