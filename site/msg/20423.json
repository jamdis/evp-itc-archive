I build very slow, but always try to make something different.  This is another one of a kind sweep.\n\nSeems there isn&#39;t much interest in the boxes anymore though.  I make them and stick it in the corner to collect dust.  I put them on EBAY or offer it to the groups, but no response from either.\n\nThat&#39;s why i don&#39;t make many anymore, what am i going to do with all of these?\n\nI get a lot of e-mails for a box, but it&#39;s all the same thing and frank can attest to this to.\n\nThey want me to build them a box and ship it to them for FREE, usually because they are a TAPS family member or somebody halfway famous in the field.\n\nI can&#39;t do that anymore, i ran out of money and frank is retired.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I heard your name in the second clip..it sounds really good\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fri, 1/28/11, urkel23@... &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: urkel23@... &lt;urkel23@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] First New Box of 2011----Steve&#39;s Box #42 [2 Attachments]\n&gt; To: rtsc@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, January 28, 2011, 6:18 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [Attachment(s) from urkel23@... included below] \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; I call this circuit a hybrid sweep.  It is a blend of random and linear modes together.  It sweeps in a linear fashion, but has a runaway speed change to it.  Let me know what you guys think of it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Steve Hultay\n&gt; www.keyportparanormal.com\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/\n&gt; www.stevehultay.com\n&gt; www.rtscresearch.org\n&gt;"}
