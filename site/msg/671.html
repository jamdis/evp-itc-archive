Perhaps it recognizes a past life? I have had spirits who say they knew me as a man LOL and one with a spirit saying "Im not a woman can you change me again". One thing I find interesting is the amount of people who have prelife memories, either from a past life or from prebirth. Hubby is one of those he remembers being somewhere like a garden playing with children and someone coming to him asking if he wanted to be a boy or a girl. He chose a boy this time.
   
  Heres the man one, it was done while I was experimenting with music.
