LOL @ grumpy, yeah well you did tell me Im a grumpy old man when we first met a long time ago. But you did delete them after you typed them so you are gettin better =)
   
  As for the radio snipets all I have to say is when my first middle and last name, friends names, relatives names get broadcast on any tv, radio, etcetera... let me know so I can tune in. Until then, its not that, and of that I have no doubt. 
   
  There are NO perfect systems out there Frank so stop being so hard on yourself. Your box works great and its a valuable tool in this work. We all want it to be clearer and louder and better and make perfect sense but the perfection is yet to be found.
   
  So until someone has the bright idea that makes it possible, if it is ever to be possible... just have fun.

I had other comments, but I doubt if it would come accross as anything but 
being negative, so I deleted that. Suffice to say I still have doubts, if 
no one else can use my boxes and get anything that resembles in the 
slightest what I get, I can't tell if the boxes work, and if few can hear 
the voices that I get, hearing instead broadcast fragments, I have to 
question my own perception. Even after seven years, I don't know what to 
make of this. Yes, there's something communicating in EVP, no, I don't know 
what "it" is, and no I don't think I have a good system yet.
