If the idea being tested is that spirits are all knowing, and my experiment=
s do not find evidence that is true=C2=A0 (so far) then that is ALL we can =
consider.=C2=A0 Nothing about spirits not-existing or anything else.=C2=A0 =
It is just one claim of many to experment with.=C2=A0 I'm not trying to att=
ack your beliefs.

And I am not attacking Frank.=C2=A0 My posts are usually=
 me defending myself when I am attacked by someone else.

re someone says, "Scamp, Scamp," then Scamp barks. "yap."  This little dog =
belonged to my grandma, when I was about 9 or 10 years old, he was a Manche=
ster Terrier, and lived with us for many years, and this is his bark for su=
re.  I'd know that bark anywhere.  Sorry, that I can't make it any clearer,=
 I need to get one of those better ghost boxes I guess.  RJ, spirits are ju=
st like us, they are not omnipresent like God,  probably why David doesn't =
want to play the guessing game, he has better things to do over there, and =
has said, they have thousands of people standing in this long line waiting =
to get into the Heavens, and He can't just drop His job and go to your hous=
e to see what you have over there, He did tell me that first time what it w=
as, and i sent it to you, but it was too late.  It's hard for me to underst=
and them sometimes, He was also right about that little boy, Syler being ki=
lled, and where his body would be
 found, I don't know what they did about =
it though. sf<br>
