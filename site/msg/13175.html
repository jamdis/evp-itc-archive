I am going to conduct a little experiment, if you all don't mind.
I will gi=
ve these instructions to several people.=A0 I encourage those here to try i=
t too.

Listen to the 3rd video on that page. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch=
?v=3D8nm3EhR9PTc&eurl=3Dhttp://www.ufogeek.com/vftse.htm

Listen especially=
 from 4:00 to 4:10
But do not go past 4:10, because then he says what he th=
inks it is saying.

Tell me what you think, if anything, the words in 4:00-=
4:10 are saying, before you have gone past 4:10 and heard what the person o=
n the audio then says he thinks he hears.
