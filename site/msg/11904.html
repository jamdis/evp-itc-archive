<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah that&#x27;s true.  But it&#x27;s sooo cool to go to a place out in the middle 
of nowhere, miles from even simple things like electric lines and radio 
towers, and get EVP responses which actually give logical answers to your 
questions. It &quot;could&quot; be anything but the probability is that it is only 
certain things. It is most likely NOT someone with a radio or other 
electronic device fooling with you.

&gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve heard of this as well, but my question was, do we have any EVP 
&gt;&gt; evidence that the *Fish Group* ever claimed to be other than dead people?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wisteria,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I forgot but you may be quite right! There are spirits who have never been 
&gt;&gt;&gt; incarnated into human form. They tend not to be involved in any way with 
&gt;&gt;&gt; lower forms of vibration.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Edgar Cayce spoke of them. Their souls were created as the moment of 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Creation. They chose not to have ever incarnated. Since their vibration 
&gt;&gt;&gt; level is far more than a lowly entity, I highly doubt that they would 
&gt;&gt;&gt; interact with lower entities. They are on a completely different level of 
&gt;&gt;&gt; existence.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I just said that in reference to Al&#x27;s comments. There are a cluster of 
&gt;&gt;&gt; researchers who insist on tagging religious myth on research... angels, 
&gt;&gt;&gt; devils, heaven, hell, assuming anything visiting our plane is &quot;stuck&quot; and 
&gt;&gt;&gt; needs &quot;saving&quot; and ignoring other energies assuming everything they hear 
&gt;&gt;&gt; is or was a human mortal.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I&#x27;ve heard from many energies claiming to be many things and some 
&gt;&gt;&gt; never having inhabited a body.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I said that because all of the examples I heard of EVP by the Fish Group 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has sounded very human and they have never claimed to have been other 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than human that I have heard. I have to base my conclusions on the EVP 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; files, not speculation, even from the victims. Do you know of instances 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where they audibly claimed to be nonhuman? I may have missed them--I 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heard a lot of EVPs from them, but certainly not the sum total. (As I 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said--I even got one myself the other day.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you&#x27;re right that they are definitely mobile, and a collective.
