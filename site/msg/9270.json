Well, that&#39;=\r\ns  pretty close to 5 volts, so \nI just tweaked the regulator up to five vol=\r\nts, and  it(the 469) runs fine. So \njust a 78L05 will do to power the 469 o=\r\nn the  sweep board. For those crazy \nenough to try this. \n\nBTW, I  guess I =\r\nleft the impression I was desperate for funds, that&#39;s not the \ncase,  the o=\r\nnly thing I really need is time! I just don&#39;t have the time to \nmake boxes =\r\n non-stop. The Old&#39; Lady will let me buy whatever I truly need, and \nthis m=\r\nonth  that will be circuit boards. I&#39;m not going to to spend every spare \np=\r\nenny on  ghost boxes. \n\nI make a few boxes for special cases, such  as--sin=\r\nce day one &quot;they&quot; have \ntalked about Chip Coffey, so he gets #34. Ann  and =\r\nMisty have been waiting years, \nso I&#39;m hoping to get thiers shipped this  w=\r\neek.

This is going to be a weird =\r\none,  it&#39;ll do a regular hack function, or it \ncan be swithed to normal box=\r\n mode.  BTW, all these boxes are going to women, \nexcept for Coffey. Most o=\r\nf the  boxes I&#39;ve ever made were to test various \nideas, then when I was do=\r\nne I just  gave them away to who ever I could pawn them \noff on, now it&#39;s a=\r\n different  story. They even say to give Moon more boxes, so \nthe demands e=\r\nven come from  the spirits.\n\nI&#39;m hoping to set aside building by the end of=\r\n  the week so I can focus on a \nprinted circuit board design.
