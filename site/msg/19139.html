<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Our group tried the various Raudive Diode&#x27;s for over five years and it
yielded precisely nothing.

The Raudive Diode was, at the time of the book Breakthrough, a new technique
that was being developed by an american physicist named Stanley that he was
working with.  The forward of the book was written by a women who worked
with Raudive shortly after the book was published.  She recounts how
Konstantin plugged the diode in between the radio and the recorder and
was embarrassed when it did not work.  Eventually it did work, but the
antennae length had to be constantly adjusted.  This basically creates a
very primitive radio crystal set.  The diode really came to light thanks to
George Meek who claims that he modified it for the Spiricom.

So does it work?

Not for us, and apparently, it worked very rarely for Raudive.

&gt; Hello everyone....
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering if anyone had tried this piece of equipment to help them
&gt; get EVP&#x27;s and what their experience was like (good, bad, neutral)? I have
&gt; read some about the original creator or discover of this method for EVP&#x27;s.
&gt; Anyway, I saw this listed on Ebay:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;This device re-creates two authentic Raudive Diode circuits in one unit
&gt; that you can record together using any stereo recording device with a
&gt; microphone socket. Unique dual circuitry gives you two different receivers
&gt; in one unit. Connects to a microphone jack on a PC or tape recorder.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks very much for your help and/or input!
