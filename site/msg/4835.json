The end i believe says &quot;hey babs&quot;, but it was in a distance and i had to bring the volume up a bit.  They clearly repeated mine and bruce&#39;s name.  I&#39;m only 1 minute in to the recording, so i&#39;ll post more if i get anything.  I hope this file helps clear up the fact that we are speaking with someone not of our realm.  I don&#39;t need verification, but this file is for those who do. \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Radio%20Shack%20Box/steve--bruce--bruce--hey_babs.mp3 \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n\nRegards,\n\nurkel232002 &lt;urkel23@...&gt;"}
