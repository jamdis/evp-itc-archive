I already figured that he stole it and i&#39;m out $80.  You probably saw mine the other day that he took from me!\n\nI made my own version last year after a friend figured out what andy did for the modification.  Been using it for a year and haven&#39;t heard anything yet.\n\nI had high hopes for this, but i fear it is just another hoax.  Check and see if it has worked for anybody else but Andy, then maybe i will re-consider that he isn&#39;t faking his results.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;hypnobarb&quot; &lt;hypnobarb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve just finished two days at the American Ghost Society conference where I was blown away by a presentation by April Slaughter on Andy Coppock&#39;s ITC Probe.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you guys know about this?\n&gt; \n&gt; She played a good portion of an eleven minute interactive, full sentence conversation that she had with her grandfather who died seven years ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unless this is a hoax, which I would hope that an MIT graduate and biomedical engineer wouldn&#39;t be part of, this is extraordinary.\n&gt; \n&gt; We heard full sentences in the same voice throughout. The words were understandable with intonation coming through.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was utterly blown away.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Coppock is doing a controlled study with it, using other scientists and a few ghost hunters.\n&gt;"}
