&gt; all a case of third-fourth-eight-hand testimony, slowly blowing out  
&gt; of proportion and reaching legendary status before you can say  
&gt; &quot;Bob&#x27;s your uncle.&quot; If there never was any EVP evidence we&#x27;d not  
&gt; even be calling them the Fish Group. They gave that name to  
&gt; themselves, through EVPs. If you don&#x27;t accept EVP as good--if not  
&gt; the best--evidence we have of paranormal communication, why are you  
&gt; here?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Some of us here have trying to approach this research in a logical  
&gt; and basically scientific way for many years. I, a least, will not  
&gt; start rolling in imaginative speculation on anyone&#x27;s whim.
