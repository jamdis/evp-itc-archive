hay all i may have the answer to the question and it is the gauss is not ma=
ssureed in sec its rated in dbl. or signal strenigh only there is no a time=
 pierod with gauss, hurts is usaly in secones ( take ur house hold power it=
s 60 herts a seconed and yes there is to power levels achived 110 to 220 vo=
lts.) thus the hertz stay the same and yet the stringht or gauss stay the s=
ame.=C2=A0 Um if you whant you can look up more on ac and dc thory and find=
 out more.

Recently someone asked me the following 
question:
=C2=A0
[I am brand =
new to the world of paranormal investigation. I believe I 
have a good gras=
p on what hertz and gauss measurments are, however am confused 
as to all o=
f the differences between them. Hertz has more to do with the 
complete cyc=
les per second and gauss is the strength of an EMF. I guess where I 
am fuz=
zy is in my lack of physics. I thought frequency is also a measurment of 
s=
trength. I may not be making much sense here, but can you tell me where I a=
m 
missing somthing?]
=C2=A0
My answer was that I wasn't entirely sure 
mys=
elf but I think=C2=A0that=C2=A0Hertz measures the wave frequencies of the 
=
entire electromagnetic spectrum. Gauss only measures the intensity or stren=
gth 
of=C2=A0EMF generated around these wave frequencies. Depending on=C2=
=A0the range 
of hertz, an EMF is generated.
=C2=A0
I told him that I would=
 check around with 
other people in the field to make sure.
=C2=A0
Was I co=
rrect?
=C2=A0
Thanks!
