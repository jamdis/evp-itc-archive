All went great except for \nthe lousy reception. I didn&#39;t realize just how much you miss during a \nreal time session when you play back what you recorded. \n\nI got two different Steve&#39;s one sounded Australian and a Mike. I also \ngot the number &quot;Seven&quot; I am sure there is lots more there but my \nreception was so bad I can&#39;t hear everything.\n\nAlso what would be a good digital recorder (relatively cheap) to get \nthat you can easily transfer to your computer?\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nKay"}
