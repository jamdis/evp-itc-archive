Well, that&#39;s pretty clo=\r\nse to 5 volts, so I just tweaked the regulator up to five volts, and it(the=\r\n 469) runs fine. So just a 78L05 will do to power the 469 on the sweep boar=\r\nd. For those crazy enough to try this.   BTW, I guess I left the impression=\r\n I was desperate for funds, that&#39;s not the case, the only thing I really ne=\r\ned is time! I just don&#39;t have the time to make boxes non-stop. The Old&#39; Lad=\r\ny will let me buy whatever I truly need, and this month that will be circui=\r\nt boards. I&#39;m not going to to spend every spare penny on ghost boxes.   I m=\r\nake a few boxes for special cases, such as--since day one &quot;they&quot; have talke=\r\nd about Chip Coffey, so he gets #34. Ann and Misty have been waiting years,=\r\n so I&#39;m hoping to get thiers shipped this week.  I did do one of my super h=\r\nacks for someone, but it was almost by intuition that I found it acceptable=\r\n, they supplied the 469. I can&#39;t do that for many, again I just don&#39;t have =\r\nthe time. This is going to be a weird one, it&#39;ll do a regular hack function=\r\n, or it can be swithed to normal box mode. BTW, all these boxes are going t=\r\no women, except for Coffey. Most of the boxes I&#39;ve ever made were to test v=\r\narious ideas, then when I was done I just gave them away to who ever I coul=\r\nd pawn them off on, now it&#39;s a different story. They even say to give Moon =\r\nmore boxes, so the demands even come from the spirits.  I&#39;m hoping to set a=\r\nside building by the end of the week so I can focus on a printed circuit bo=\r\nard design. I want like a universal sweep/amplifier board. This last one I =\r\nmade over the weekend took ten hours to wire by hand, I can eliminate that =\r\nmuch labor by having some boards made, since the sweep, and amplifiers are =\r\npretty much the same from system to system.
