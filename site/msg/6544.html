&gt; Not in my opinion your posts are very intelligent and well thought out
&gt; your comments the sign of experience, and you are getting very good  
&gt; communication
&gt; worthy of respect, I think your guidance to other less experienced  
&gt; new comers to the
&gt; field would be welcomed and appreciated.

&gt; Ah, but I am still such a baby! I know nothing yet! Nothing. There  
&gt; is so far to go and so much to uncover before I can teach anyone  
&gt; anything.

&gt; Good file, You are definately ready to leave the nest and start to  
&gt; soar on your own.
&gt; maybe you should start to spread some of your experience to the  
&gt; newer people.
&gt;
&gt; It&#x27;s odvious you know what your doing.
