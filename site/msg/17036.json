The 2012 issue offers a unique opportunity to resolve this question.\n\nS=\r\nome Mayan experts say that the notion that they Mayan calendar ends\nin 2012=\r\n is in fact a misinterpretation of the facts; that the current Mayan\ncalend=\r\nar indeed ends in that year, but Mayan calendars continue on well\ninto the =\r\nnext millenium at least. If this is true the Mayans may have never\nbelieved=\r\n everything would come to an end in the year we know as 2012.\n\nThe only rea=\r\nl test is to wait until the end of 2012 and see what happens.\nLet&#39;s be opti=\r\nmistic and presume that nothing or little untoward indeed\noccurs. What=C2=\r\n=A0would this say about these, and similar communications?\n\nOne reasonable =\r\nsuggestion is that this would support the idea that the \ncommunications are=\r\n not from an external source, but are instead coming\nfrom ourselves or at l=\r\neast from other living beings. If the predictions turn \nout to be wrong, th=\r\nis seems like convincing evidence that the source was\nin fact misinformed. =\r\nAnd while it is possible that discarnate entities are\nplaying tricks on us,=\r\n an equally reasonable interpretation is that we are\nin fact the source at =\r\nleast of these communications, perhaps through \nsome form of PK. \n\nAs I hav=\r\ne reported here before, there is good test data that suggests \nthis is quit=\r\ne possible in living persons. So this would be one more data \npoint support=\r\ning the thesis that EVPs may in fact be the product of the \nliving and not =\r\nthe dead.\n\nIt will be an interesting couple of years, no matter what - that=\r\n is certain.\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: &quot;EVP-ITC@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&quot; &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: =\r\nThu, April 22, 2010 9:37:22 PM\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] Digest Number 1808[7 Atta=\r\nchments]\n\nThere are 25 messages in this issue.\n\nTopics in this digest:\n\n1a.=\r\n Re: and it gets freakier.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 \n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 From: April Abercrom=\r\nbie\n1b.

The late Peter James actually=\r\n\nbecame well-known because he facilitated the production of the audible\nvoi=\r\nce of the little girl known to him (and the rest of the world) as &quot;Jackie.&quot;=\r\n\nThis recording, not an EVP, became for many clear evidence that the \nlittl=\r\ne girl was quite real. Many people, including some known personally\nto me, =\r\nclaim to have seen this little girl and others in the First Class Pool\narea=\r\n. This story goes back many years before Disney had anything to do\nwith the=\r\n Queen Mary, so I think it is correct to say that myth is wrong.\n\n\n=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n\n________________________________\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 Date: Wed Apr 21, 2010 12:50 pm ((PDT))\n\n=C3=82=C2=A0 Yeah, that was fr=\r\nom me(Frank). Yeah that helps, at least you&#39;re not just\nsome brainiac debun=\r\nker that knows it all cuz he says so.\n\nAnyway, I find it very difficult to =\r\nget absolutes with this work, as the\nmind has a hell of lot to do with it. =\r\nAn example, I started out using a\nrandiom voltage to sweep the radios becua=\r\nse I was using EVPmaker previous to\nmaking boxes, and EVPmaker uses a metho=\r\nd of chopping up the raw audio, and\nplaying it back for use by the enities.=\r\n When I first swtiched to a linear\nsweep all I couyld hear was gibberish, t=\r\nhen very suddenly I hear hear &quot;them&quot;\ntalking on my fisrt linear sweep box. =\r\nSo did it take &quot;them&quot; time to adapt,\nor did it take my brain to make sense =\r\nout of the gibberish.\n\nFor me, I don&#39;t care which it is, I think it&#39;s valid=\r\n either way. If it is\nonly the mind creating the messages you hear, which I=\r\n doubt because others\ncan hear alot of this stuff, then I think it&#39;s still =\r\nbeing used as a psychic\nprop and the information is valid.\n\nThen there&#39;s th=\r\ne probelm of expectations, if you test this stuff in a lab,\nI think you&#39;ll =\r\nlimit your results, and get whatever is expected. If you&#39;r\nexpecting eviden=\r\nce of a haunting, that&#39;s what you get. I was on the Queen\nmary last fall, i=\r\nn the pool area there is supposedly a littlegirl stuck\nthere and you can ge=\r\nt all the EVPs, and=C3=82=C2=A0 EMF readings and interactions to\nverify it,=\r\n but that story (I heard) was started by Disney to bring in\ntourists. There=\r\n were some that claimed to &quot;corss over&quot; hundreds of souls on\nthe QM, so why=\r\n is the QM still haunted?=C3=82=C2=A0 I don&#39;t go the &quot;haunted areas&quot; to\nrec=\r\nord.\n\nI get voices like this, which seem to be pretty much ignored if it do=\r\nesn&#39;t\nfit the ghost hunter expectation, but it shows how broadcast fragment=\r\n are\nmanipulated.\n\nIt&#39;s not all cut and dried, and can be vary complicated.=\r\n\n\nFrank-S\n\nOn Wed, Apr 21, 2010 at 12:34 PM, John S &lt;phenom_investigator@ya=\r\nhoo.com&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C3=82=C2=A0 I don&#39;t know if Frank&#39;s question regardin=\r\ng experience was to myself or to\n&gt; Dwayne.\n&gt;\n&gt; In case it was to me, here i=\r\ns a brief summary of my work.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been involved with Parapsychol=\r\nogy research for about 4 d\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}
