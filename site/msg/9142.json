One can argue that the person in spirit has \ngone to great lengths \n&gt; to make contact with their loved one. However.......\n&gt; \n&gt; On the flip side, just because someone is in spirit, does not mean \nthat they are \n&gt; automatically omniscient, nor that they have the right to impose \ntheir will (or you impose \n&gt; your will, for that matter) on a loved one who may not be open to \nthe communication \n&gt; emotionally or spiritually. \n&gt; \n&gt; Assuming we are (as many indications have it) pretty much the same \nperson in spirit that \n&gt; we were here in the physical (our personalities remain fairly in \ntact, though just as here, \n&gt; there can be growth and change on the other side), it would not be \nout of the realm of \n&gt; possibility for them to tell you their loved one is open to \ncommunication, when in fact they \n&gt; might not be.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess my bottom line is this: There are so many people out \nthere who are open to the \n&gt; idea of EVP communication and are seeking to make contact with \ntheir departed loved \n&gt; ones, that there is no need for approaching strangers with \nmessages. The potential for \n&gt; harm is just too great, and it is not our place (or the place of \nthe person in spirit) to make \n&gt; these kind of decisions for others. If this is what interests you \n(helping those in spirit to \n&gt; pass messages along), then seek to make connections with people in \nthe physical who are \n&gt; openly and willingly on board your assistance. \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Margaret and other colleagues on this forum, if a proven \nprocess can be initiated, the \n&gt; information captured very clearly, and not faint, and it has to be \nclear that anyone \n&gt; listening will hear the words, and if the spirit can confirm the \ninfo we have before them to \n&gt; be accurate, and if the spirit can assure us that their loved one \nwill not be offended, then \n&gt; would it be ok for us to proceed?

In every field there are crooks, so we \ncan at best hope we are \n&gt; with a kind person when the meeting takes place.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But if a person just goes out and buys a radio shack hack, and \nthis is not their field, \n&gt; and they do get a message, if these individuals try and make money \noff the recipient of \n&gt; the message, that would in my book be terrible. The reason is that \nthe spirit contacted \n&gt; the living to get help, and now that living person is ripping off \ntheir loved one for cash \n&gt; before they deliver the goods. If a spirit asks for help, we \nshould do it for free.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I write procedures for my company, and have been outlining a \nprocess to test with a \n&gt; willing spirit who wants to make contact with their loved one. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So what would I or any of us need to make contact? Meaning if \na spirit gave me &quot;John \n&gt; Smith&quot; of Norfolk, VA, confirmation would be a night mare at best. \nI would need to \n&gt; perhaps lay out a list of actuall addresses in that city and state \nto have the spirit tell me \n&gt; which one on my desk, on my list is the correct oerson, and then \nas you say how would \n&gt; this person respond to my call about my research and that a voice \ngave me their name and \n&gt; I have a recorded message for them? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Margaret and other colleagues on this forum, if a proven \nprocess can be initiated, the \n&gt; information captured very clearly, and not faint, and it has to be \nclear that anyone \n&gt; listening will hear the words, and if the spirit can confirm the \ninfo we have before them to \n&gt; be accurate, and if the spirit can assure us that their loved one \nwill not be offended, then \n&gt; would it be ok for us to proceed? And why not?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My plan is to set up a spirit profile along with on same page \nthe loved one&#39;s profile. But \n&gt; before I actually make contact, I want to be sure that who i am \ncontacting is the real deal, \n&gt; and that they will not be offended. I have been laying out canned \ncalls, for example, \n&gt; &quot;Hello, my name is xyz, and I am engaged in xxx research involving \nEVP. (Explain what \n&gt; that is), and a voice picked up on my recording gave me your name, \nand go from there. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thinking out loud here, I would think that the sprit would \nknow if their loved one \n&gt; would be in acceptance to me contacting them. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am documenting everything step by step, and I do plan to \nattempt contact if I have \n&gt; the right info. I am thinking that I need to tweak my profile to \nget confirmation on \n&gt; whether the loved one would be in acceptance of me delivering the \nmessage.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If there are any of you that have actually contacted a loved \none you did not know that a \n&gt; spirit asked you to contact, please advise how you handled the \nfirst call.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know it may take me days, weeks, months and even perhaps \nyears to get enough info \n&gt; on one profile to make contact, but I really want to do this and I \nwant to perfect it, so \n&gt; others can become messengers for the deceased. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Michael. I have had the honor many times of either \nreceiving messages for \n&gt; someone \n&gt; &gt; from their loved one and passing them on (to people I know) or \nin helping people learn \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; record for and receive their own messages. Along with research \nin trying to improve \n&gt; &gt; communication with the other side, this is my primary work with \nEVP... helping others \n&gt; who \n&gt; &gt; are grieving make contact with their loved ones. I do not charge \nfor this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think to charge, or attempt to charge, anyone for a service \n(spiritual or otherwise) on \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; backend is slimy. However, if there is an agreement in advance \nabout fees and services, \n&gt; &gt; then that is up to the consenting parties. People in all types \nof fields get paid for their \n&gt; &gt; time, regardless of the service being offered. If the fee is \nclear, the service being offered \n&gt; &gt; legitimate, so be it. As long as people aren&#39;t being scammed. \ngrrrr...... I don&#39;t like to see \n&gt; &gt; people taken advantage of in any field of service (as one \ncrooked auto mechanic tried to \n&gt; &gt; do recently with my mother.) Double grrrrrr........ \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As for figuring out who a message belongs to? I think we have to \nbe very cautious in \n&gt; &gt; coming forward with content in recordings that were not \nrequested by the living loved \n&gt; one \n&gt; &gt; of the person in spirit. It&#39;s sort of like the doctor&#39;s creed to \nfirst do no harm. I feel unless \n&gt; &gt; you know someone well enough to be fairly certain that your \ndoing so would not \n&gt; &gt; traumatize them, you have to err on the side of caution and not \nsay anything. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For instance, there are some people who, due to their religious \nbeliefs, could feel that \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; are being fooled by a demon or some other evil and that your \nsaying you are in a touch \n&gt; &gt; with a loved one of theirs is not only not true, but cruel of \nyou to claim so. Even worse, \n&gt; &gt; would be those who actually do believe you have heard from their \nloved one, but take \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; to mean they are not in &#39;Heaven&#39; (as some believe those in \nHeaven do not have the \n&gt; ability \n&gt; &gt; to communicate here.) There&#39;s all kinds of beliefs which differ \nfrom our reality that our \n&gt; &gt; loved ones can be exactly where they are supposed to be, in a \ngood place, and still talk \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; us via EVP. We have to make sure that there is a similarity in \nworld views.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In regard to mediumship: Even as a experienced EVPer, and having \nmade connections \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; my own loved ones, I still benefited from my sitting for an hour \nwith a medium. One of \n&gt; &gt; the really neat things is, I brought my recorders and upon \nplayback, can actually hear \n&gt; EVP \n&gt; &gt; that relates to what the medium is saying. So, as you wrote, \nthat was icing on the cake. \n&gt; &gt; But the sitting alone, even without the EVP heard later, \nprovided an explanation for \n&gt; events \n&gt; &gt; and a peace of mind to me about something I had carried with me \nfor 25yrs and had not \n&gt; &gt; been able to resolve via EVP alone. The fee for that sitting was \nsome of the best money \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve ever spent in my life, as what I got from it was priceless.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Personally, I&#39;d like to see some joint studies done with mediums \nand EVP, each modality \n&gt; &gt; helping to validate the other in the process. :-)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Michael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Amazing I take a weeks vacation and come back to 350 notes, \nand see this one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Both of your arguments are indeed accurate. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But it is an added bonus to the recipient or customer to hear \ntheir loved one&#39;s voice on \n&gt; &gt; tape rather that by word of mouth from a gifted clairaudient, \nclairvoyant, psychic \n&gt; person. \n&gt; &gt; That is the icing on the cake.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What would bother me terribly is if any of us researchers \nreceived a message from a \n&gt; &gt; spirit in which we could actually make contact with their loved \none to send the tape, and \n&gt; &gt; then to try and charge the contactee for the recording. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion if any of us receive such a message with that \nclarity, we should \n&gt; &gt; send/give it to the contactee free of charge as doing so is in a \nsense a spiritual gift \n&gt; from \n&gt; &gt; the spirit to the contactee, and we are just the messenger. I \nhave been researching this \n&gt; &gt; concept, and I myself hope to one day be able to receive clear \nand concise messages \n&gt; which \n&gt; &gt; would enable me to contact the spirit&#39;s loved one to give them \nthat message should they \n&gt; &gt; wish to receive it. And I gurantee you it will be free of \ncharge. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have any of you received on any occasion enough info from the \nspirits to be able to \n&gt; &gt; contact the loved one and give them the recording?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Early Cuyler &lt;ecuyler@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; How true it is.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Steve Hultay &lt;urkel23@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, April 6, 2008 7:53:35 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: boxes on ebay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There will always be a market for less educated people and \nsome to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; take advantage of that.

I&#39;m just \nsaying \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there are those who take advantage and should have no business \nin \n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing so. One example I can give is Chris Moon. He charges \npeople \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to do box sessions. I can&#39;t remember the exact fee, but it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; outrageous that he&#39;s doing this, not to mention, he does so \nwith a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank&#39;s box. He is a self proclaimed medium and I&#39;ve heard \nfrom many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sources that he is nothing but a fake. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I attribute my frustration with people of this type, but \nagain I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; say, as long as there are people dumb enough to pay for this, \nthen \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there will always be those who take advantage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, I feel anyone who is gifted with mediumship or \nother \n&gt; &gt; &gt; advanced intuitive abilities should use it as a gift to help \nothers, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not for monetary gain.. I&#39;m not being judgmental here, that&#39;s \njust \n&gt; &gt; &gt; how I feel. I have a friend who is also a legitimate medium \nand I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t agree that she should use her abilities for gain, but it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t mean I like her any less. My not liking it won&#39;t \nchange the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fact that it happens, it&#39;s just the way things go. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do I think that Ron is taking advantage of people? No I \ndon&#39;t. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ron says he uses the best parts available and that the cost of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Minibox is very close to what it costs to manufacture it. How \nclose, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have no idea. On the other hand, I don&#39;t own one as I think \n$399 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or $449 for the &quot;crystal enhanced version,&quot; is a lot to pay \nfor a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; device that, from what I&#39;ve heard, produces the same results \nas a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Radio Shack radio for $25-$40. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@ ...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, April 5, 2008 1:32:28 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: boxes on ebay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Jeremy. If everyone knew about these support \n&gt; &gt; &gt; boards and that other resources are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; available to them, that would be one thing. Obviously \neveryone \n&gt; &gt; &gt; here is aware of that. But \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not everyone knows this place exists. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And even if they do know about the boards here, how many \nwould have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the nerve to ask \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for help from strangers? As Bruce recently shared, he gives \npeople \n&gt; &gt; &gt; invitations to contact \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him privately in case they are too shy just ask a question \n&gt; &gt; &gt; publicly. Which means, by the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way, to some degree they have overcome some of that shyness \nin \n&gt; &gt; &gt; order to post whatever it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was to begin with, which inspired him to make this offer. \nWhat if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they don&#39;t even have the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gumption to be anything more than be a look-i-loo?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m guessing many people are just surfing the net, checking \nout \n&gt; &gt; &gt; paranormal stuff, and run \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; across the hacked boxes for sale. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, I ask people who are taking the position you and \nBruce are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; regarding profits ... do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you have this same harsh sentiment toward Ron Ricketts, who \nmakes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and sells the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MiniBoxes? I realize he is passionate about this research \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; helping others. Does that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give him amnesty for making a profit? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I think we need to not be so judgmental. At what \npoint \n&gt; &gt; &gt; does &quot;profitable gain in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the paranormal field&quot; become &quot;sickening?&quot; I have a friend \nwho is a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; medium. I mean THE \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REAL DEAL. He charges for his services. The fee is \nreasonable \n&gt; &gt; &gt; compared to many in his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field. Does he do this because he&#39;s a terrible person \nlooking to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; take advantage of people? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NO, he does so because he has been given a gift that changes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; people&#39;s lives for the better. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But he has to make a living.... has to support himself in \nsome way. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And because he has \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chosen to provide this service full time (and is not a trust \nfund \n&gt; &gt; &gt; baby), he makes a profit. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This allows him to help far more people than he could if \nworking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; some other kind of job \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and providing his services at no cost on the side. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I realize this is not exactly the same thing as gouging \npeople on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the price for a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; commercially available product, but making such blanket \nstatements \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about profitability in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the paranormal field being sickening is rather short-\nsighted, in my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a southern friend who likes to say, &quot;It&#39;s a mighty \nthin \n&gt; &gt; &gt; plank that ain&#39;t got two sides.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just don&#39;t think we have the right to claim that simply \nbecause \n&gt; &gt; &gt; someone is offering a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; good and or service for profit to consumers in the \nparanormal \n&gt; &gt; &gt; market, that this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatically means they are taking advantage of other&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; vulnerabilities. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For Pete&#39;s sake, no one is twisting the people&#39;s arms to buy \nthose \n&gt; &gt; &gt; units on eBay. They are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfectly free to buy from whatever source they choose. \nSince the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; units do work as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claimed, we can argue that people have overpaid, shopped \nunwisely, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or whatever. I assure \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you this happens every single day throughout the retail \nmarket \n&gt; &gt; &gt; place with all types of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; products and services. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will say I have a fairly heathy dose of distain for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; charlatans/scam artists (of any flavor in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any field) but that is not what we are talking about here. \nWe are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; talking about people who \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are offering legitimate products to consumers. I&#39;d rather \nsee \n&gt; &gt; &gt; people doing this for profit, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even when obscene, than running scams that damage people&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; physical, mental, and/or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; financial well-being. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Early Cuyler &lt;ecuyler@ &gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Very well put, Bruce.

Unfortunately, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are those who continue to support the ones profiting, \nso it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will continue. It makes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me sick that people take advantage of others \nvulnerabilities, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; especially when it comes to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual matters, but that&#39;s a rant for another time and \nplace.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If someone is afraid to try hacking a radio or lacks the \nproper \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tools, they are more than \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; welcome to send them to me and I&#39;ll do it for them and ship \nit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; back. As Bruce said, it&#39;s not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for recognition, but it&#39;s to help further the research.

The more we work \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together, the better the communication will get. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: bruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestig ating@ &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: evp-itc@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, April 5, 2008 11:15:21 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] boxes on ebay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Guy&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do not give in to these demons that are trying to make a \nbuck \n&gt; &gt; &gt; from the research we love \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the equipment we use.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have given away including the shipping 5 RS boxes for \nfree, 4, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 470&#39;s and 1 469 all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hacked by me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did not do it to gain popularity or even wanted a thank \nyou. my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sole motivation was to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bring new people into the research and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in turn change someones life and perpetuate the idea of \nstrength \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in numbers, in this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case strength of communication.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To all new people on this board, do not patronise these \nwolves \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that prey on the needs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wants of others. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The RS 20 -125 is everything the 470 & 469 are and a \nlittle more. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; do not let the size or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complicated button arrangement scare you off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the hack is as simple as the others. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do not buy any RS hacks from ebay, they are sold with the \nwrong \n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy attached to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them, spirit wise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is why I and all other researchers should follow the \nexample \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of a great man to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom we owe all of this research.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mr. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to \nmake a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; substantial amount of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; money from his boxes and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was offered the opportunity on a silver platter. But chose \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; follow what had been asked \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of him by higher entities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And that was to keep the research pure for research sake. \nAnd \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that at no time was this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equipment or knowledge there of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be for monetary gain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I adhere to this promise made by Frank to our friends on \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; other side and feel that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is no need to give in to these box \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extortionists. . If a box is not attainable for a new \nperson yet, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the right way. Then it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably is not their time yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have coined a phrase and believe in it. &quot;The researcher \ndoes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not choose the box, the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box chooses the researcher&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Be patient, those that do not yet have a box.

One can argue that the person in spirit has &lt;BR&gt;gone to great lengths &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to make contact with their loved one. However.....&lt;WBR&gt;..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; On the flip side, just because someone is in spirit, does not mean &lt;BR&gt;that they are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; automatically omniscient, nor that they have the right to impose &lt;BR&gt;their will (or you impose &lt;BR&gt;&gt; your will, for that matter) on a loved one who may not be open to &lt;BR&gt;the communication &lt;BR&gt;&gt; emotionally or spiritually. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Assuming we are (as many indications have it) pretty much the same &lt;BR&gt;person in spirit that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; we were here in the physical (our personalities remain fairly in &lt;BR&gt;tact, though just as here, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; there can be growth and change on the other side), it would not be &lt;BR&gt;out of the realm of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; possibility for them to tell you their loved one is open to &lt;BR&gt;communication, when in fact they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; might not be.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I guess my bottom\n line is this: There are so many people out &lt;BR&gt;there who are open to the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; idea of EVP communication and are seeking to make contact with &lt;BR&gt;their departed loved &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ones, that there is no need for approaching strangers with &lt;BR&gt;messages. The potential for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; harm is just too great, and it is not our place (or the place of &lt;BR&gt;the person in spirit) to make &lt;BR&gt;&gt; these kind of decisions for others. If this is what interests you &lt;BR&gt;(helping those in spirit to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; pass messages along), then seek to make connections with people in &lt;BR&gt;the physical who are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; openly and willingly on board your assistance. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Margaret&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Margaret and other colleagues on this forum, if a proven &lt;BR&gt;process can be initiated, the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; information captured very clearly, and not faint, and it has to be &lt;BR&gt;clear that anyone &lt;BR&gt;&gt; listening will hear the words, and if the spirit can confirm the &lt;BR&gt;info we have before\n them to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; be accurate, and if the spirit can assure us that their loved one &lt;BR&gt;will not be offended, then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; would it be ok for us to proceed? And why not? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, Michael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks Margaret.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If your vocation is a psychic in which patrons pay a known fee &lt;BR&gt;up front, and this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; physcic uses the box as an additional tool to get that icing on &lt;BR&gt;the cake, the actual voice, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that I have no issues with. In every field there are crooks, so we &lt;BR&gt;can at best hope we are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with a kind person when the meeting takes place.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But if a person just goes out and buys a radio shack hack, and &lt;BR&gt;this is not their field, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and they do get a message, if these individuals try and make money &lt;BR&gt;off the recipient of\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the message, that would in my book be terrible. The reason is that &lt;BR&gt;the spirit contacted &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the living to get help, and now that living person is ripping off &lt;BR&gt;their loved one for cash &lt;BR&gt;&gt; before they deliver the goods. If a spirit asks for help, we &lt;BR&gt;should do it for free.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I write procedures for my company, and have been outlining a &lt;BR&gt;process to test with a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; willing spirit who wants to make contact with their loved one. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; So what would I or any of us need to make contact? Meaning if &lt;BR&gt;a spirit gave me &quot;John &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Smith&quot; of Norfolk, VA, confirmation would be a night mare at best. &lt;BR&gt;I would need to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; perhaps lay out a list of actuall addresses in that city and state &lt;BR&gt;to have the spirit tell me &lt;BR&gt;&gt; which one on my desk, on my list is the correct oerson, and then &lt;BR&gt;as you say how would &lt;BR&gt;&gt; this person respond to my call about my research and that a voice\n &lt;BR&gt;gave me their name and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have a recorded message for them? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Margaret and other colleagues on this forum, if a proven &lt;BR&gt;process can be initiated, the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; information captured very clearly, and not faint, and it has to be &lt;BR&gt;clear that anyone &lt;BR&gt;&gt; listening will hear the words, and if the spirit can confirm the &lt;BR&gt;info we have before them to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; be accurate, and if the spirit can assure us that their loved one &lt;BR&gt;will not be offended, then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; would it be ok for us to proceed? And why not?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; My plan is to set up a spirit profile along with on same page &lt;BR&gt;the loved one&#39;s profile. But &lt;BR&gt;&gt; before I actually make contact, I want to be sure that who i am &lt;BR&gt;contacting is the real deal, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and that they will not be offended. I have been laying out canned &lt;BR&gt;calls, for example, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, my name is xyz, and I am engaged in xxx research involving &lt;BR&gt;EVP. (Explain what\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that is), and a voice picked up on my recording gave me your name, &lt;BR&gt;and go from there. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thinking out loud here, I would think that the sprit would &lt;BR&gt;know if their loved one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; would be in acceptance to me contacting them. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I am documenting everything step by step, and I do plan to &lt;BR&gt;attempt contact if I have &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the right info. I am thinking that I need to tweak my profile to &lt;BR&gt;get confirmation on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; whether the loved one would be in acceptance of me delivering the &lt;BR&gt;message.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If there are any of you that have actually contacted a loved &lt;BR&gt;one you did not know that a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; spirit asked you to contact, please advise how you handled the &lt;BR&gt;first call.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I know it may take me days, weeks, months and even perhaps &lt;BR&gt;years to get enough info &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on one profile to make contact, but I really want to do this and I &lt;BR&gt;want to\n perfect it, so &lt;BR&gt;&gt; others can become messengers for the deceased. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Michael. I have had the honor many times of either &lt;BR&gt;receiving messages for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; someone &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; from their loved one and passing them on (to people I know) or &lt;BR&gt;in helping people learn &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; record for and receive their own messages. Along with research &lt;BR&gt;in trying to improve &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; communication with the other side, this is my primary work with &lt;BR&gt;EVP... helping others &lt;BR&gt;&gt; who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; are grieving make contact with their loved ones. I do not charge &lt;BR&gt;for this.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I think to charge, or attempt to charge, anyone for a service &lt;BR&gt;(spiritual or otherwise) on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; backend is slimy. However, if there is an agreement in advance &lt;BR&gt;about fees and services, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; then that is up to the consenting parties.\n People in all types &lt;BR&gt;of fields get paid for their &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; time, regardless of the service being offered. If the fee is &lt;BR&gt;clear, the service being offered &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; legitimate, so be it. As long as people aren&#39;t being scammed. &lt;BR&gt;grrrr...... I don&#39;t like to see &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; people taken advantage of in any field of service (as one &lt;BR&gt;crooked auto mechanic tried to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; do recently with my mother.) Double grrrrrr.....&lt;WBR&gt;... &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As for figuring out who a message belongs to? I think we have to &lt;BR&gt;be very cautious in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; coming forward with content in recordings that were not &lt;BR&gt;requested by the living loved &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of the person in spirit. It&#39;s sort of like the doctor&#39;s creed to &lt;BR&gt;first do no harm. I feel unless &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; you know someone well enough to be fairly certain that your &lt;BR&gt;doing so would not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; traumatize them, you have to err on the side of caution and not &lt;BR&gt;say\n anything. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; For instance, there are some people who, due to their religious &lt;BR&gt;beliefs, could feel that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; are being fooled by a demon or some other evil and that your &lt;BR&gt;saying you are in a touch &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with a loved one of theirs is not only not true, but cruel of &lt;BR&gt;you to claim so. Even worse, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; would be those who actually do believe you have heard from their &lt;BR&gt;loved one, but take &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to mean they are not in &#39;Heaven&#39; (as some believe those in &lt;BR&gt;Heaven do not have the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ability &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to communicate here.) There&#39;s all kinds of beliefs which differ &lt;BR&gt;from our reality that our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; loved ones can be exactly where they are supposed to be, in a &lt;BR&gt;good place, and still talk &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; us via EVP. We have to make sure that there is a similarity in &lt;BR&gt;world views.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In regard to mediumship: Even as a experienced\n EVPer, and having &lt;BR&gt;made connections &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; my own loved ones, I still benefited from my sitting for an hour &lt;BR&gt;with a medium. One of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the really neat things is, I brought my recorders and upon &lt;BR&gt;playback, can actually hear &lt;BR&gt;&gt; EVP &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that relates to what the medium is saying. So, as you wrote, &lt;BR&gt;that was icing on the cake. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But the sitting alone, even without the EVP heard later, &lt;BR&gt;provided an explanation for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; events &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and a peace of mind to me about something I had carried with me &lt;BR&gt;for 25yrs and had not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; been able to resolve via EVP alone. The fee for that sitting was &lt;BR&gt;some of the best money &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve ever spent in my life, as what I got from it was priceless.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Personally, I&#39;d like to see some joint studies done with mediums &lt;BR&gt;and EVP, each modality &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; helping to validate the other in the process. :-)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Margaret&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, Michael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Amazing I take a weeks vacation and come back to 350 notes, &lt;BR&gt;and see this one.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Both of your arguments are indeed accurate. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But it is an added bonus to the recipient or customer to hear &lt;BR&gt;their loved one&#39;s voice on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; tape rather that by word of mouth from a gifted clairaudient, &lt;BR&gt;clairvoyant, psychic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; person. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; That is the icing on the cake.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What would bother me terribly is if any of us researchers &lt;BR&gt;received a message from a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; spirit in which we could actually make contact with their loved &lt;BR&gt;one to send the tape, and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; then to try and charge the contactee for the recording.\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion if any of us receive such a message with that &lt;BR&gt;clarity, we should &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; send/give it to the contactee free of charge as doing so is in a &lt;BR&gt;sense a spiritual gift &lt;BR&gt;&gt; from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the spirit to the contactee, and we are just the messenger. I &lt;BR&gt;have been researching this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; concept, and I myself hope to one day be able to receive clear &lt;BR&gt;and concise messages &lt;BR&gt;&gt; which &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; would enable me to contact the spirit&#39;s loved one to give them &lt;BR&gt;that message should they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wish to receive it. And I gurantee you it will be free of &lt;BR&gt;charge. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Have any of you received on any occasion enough info from the &lt;BR&gt;spirits to be able to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; contact the loved one and give them the recording?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Early Cuyler &lt;ecuyler@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; How true it is.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Steve Hultay &lt;urkel23@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, April 6, 2008 7:53:35 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: boxes on ebay&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There will always be a market for less educated people and &lt;BR&gt;some to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; take advantage of that. There is a a saying out there----&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Stupid &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; people don&#39;t know they&#39;re stupid&quot;. How true is that.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -Steve &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Early Cuyler &lt;ecuyler@ &gt; &lt;BR&gt;wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Margaret, I can&#39;t argue with what you&#39;ve said. I&#39;m\n just &lt;BR&gt;saying &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; there are those who take advantage and should have no business &lt;BR&gt;in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; doing so. One example I can give is Chris Moon. He charges &lt;BR&gt;people &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to do box sessions. I can&#39;t remember the exact fee, but it&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; outrageous that he&#39;s doing this, not to mention, he does so &lt;BR&gt;with a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank&#39;s box. He is a self proclaimed medium and I&#39;ve heard &lt;BR&gt;from many &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sources that he is nothing but a fake. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I attribute my frustration with people of this type, but &lt;BR&gt;again I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; say, as long as there are people dumb enough to pay for this, &lt;BR&gt;then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; there will always be those who take advantage.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, I feel anyone who is gifted with mediumship or &lt;BR&gt;other &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; advanced intuitive abilities should use it as a gift to help\n &lt;BR&gt;others, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; not for monetary gain.. I&#39;m not being judgmental here, that&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;just &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; how I feel. I have a friend who is also a legitimate medium &lt;BR&gt;and I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t agree that she should use her abilities for gain, but it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t mean I like her any less. My not liking it won&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;change the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fact that it happens, it&#39;s just the way things go. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do I think that Ron is taking advantage of people? No I &lt;BR&gt;don&#39;t. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ron says he uses the best parts available and that the cost of &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Minibox is very close to what it costs to manufacture it. How &lt;BR&gt;close, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I have no idea. On the other hand, I don&#39;t own one as I think &lt;BR&gt;$399 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; or $449 for the &quot;crystal enhanced version,&quot; is a lot to pay &lt;BR&gt;for a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; device that, from what I&#39;ve heard, produces the same\n results &lt;BR&gt;as a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Radio Shack radio for $25-$40. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@ ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, April 5, 2008 1:32:28 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: boxes on ebay&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Jeremy. If everyone knew about these support &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; boards and that other resources are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; available to them, that would be one thing. Obviously &lt;BR&gt;everyone &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; here is aware of that. But &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not everyone knows this place exists. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And even if they do know about the boards here, how many &lt;BR&gt;would have &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the nerve to ask &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for help from\n strangers? As Bruce recently shared, he gives &lt;BR&gt;people &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; invitations to contact &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him privately in case they are too shy just ask a question &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; publicly. Which means, by the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way, to some degree they have overcome some of that shyness &lt;BR&gt;in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; order to post whatever it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was to begin with, which inspired him to make this offer. &lt;BR&gt;What if &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; they don&#39;t even have the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gumption to be anything more than be a look-i-loo?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m guessing many people are just surfing the net, checking &lt;BR&gt;out &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; paranormal stuff, and run &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; across the hacked boxes for sale. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, I ask people who are taking the position you and &lt;BR&gt;Bruce are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; regarding profits ... do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you\n have this same harsh sentiment toward Ron Ricketts, who &lt;BR&gt;makes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and sells the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MiniBoxes? I realize he is passionate about this research &lt;BR&gt;and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; helping others. Does that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give him amnesty for making a profit? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I think we need to not be so judgmental. At what &lt;BR&gt;point &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; does &quot;profitable gain in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the paranormal field&quot; become &quot;sickening?&quot; I have a friend &lt;BR&gt;who is a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; medium. I mean THE &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REAL DEAL. He charges for his services. The fee is &lt;BR&gt;reasonable &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; compared to many in his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field. Does he do this because he&#39;s a terrible person &lt;BR&gt;looking to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; take advantage of people? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NO, he does so because he has been given a gift that changes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; people&#39;s lives for\n the better. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But he has to make a living.... has to support himself in &lt;BR&gt;some way. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; And because he has &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chosen to provide this service full time (and is not a trust &lt;BR&gt;fund &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; baby), he makes a profit. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This allows him to help far more people than he could if &lt;BR&gt;working &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; some other kind of job &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and providing his services at no cost on the side. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I realize this is not exactly the same thing as gouging &lt;BR&gt;people on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the price for a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; commercially available product, but making such blanket &lt;BR&gt;statements &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; about profitability in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the paranormal field being sickening is rather short-&lt;BR&gt;sighted, in my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a southern friend who\n likes to say, &quot;It&#39;s a mighty &lt;BR&gt;thin &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; plank that ain&#39;t got two sides.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just don&#39;t think we have the right to claim that simply &lt;BR&gt;because &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; someone is offering a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; good and or service for profit to consumers in the &lt;BR&gt;paranormal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; market, that this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatically means they are taking advantage of other&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; vulnerabilities. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For Pete&#39;s sake, no one is twisting the people&#39;s arms to buy &lt;BR&gt;those &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; units on eBay. They are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfectly free to buy from whatever source they choose. &lt;BR&gt;Since the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; units do work as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claimed, we can argue that people have overpaid, shopped &lt;BR&gt;unwisely, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; or whatever. I assure &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you this happens every single day throughout the retail &lt;BR&gt;market\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; place with all types of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; products and services. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will say I have a fairly heathy dose of distain for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; charlatans/scam artists (of any flavor in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any field) but that is not what we are talking about here. &lt;BR&gt;We are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; talking about people who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are offering legitimate products to consumers. I&#39;d rather &lt;BR&gt;see &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; people doing this for profit, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even when obscene, than running scams that damage people&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; physical, mental, and/or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; financial well-being. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Margaret&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Early Cuyler &lt;ecuyler@ &gt; &lt;BR&gt;wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Very well put, Bruce. Profitable gain in the\n paranormal &lt;BR&gt;field is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sickening.. Unfortunately, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are those who continue to support the ones profiting, &lt;BR&gt;so it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; will continue. It makes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me sick that people take advantage of others &lt;BR&gt;vulnerabilities, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; especially when it comes to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual matters, but that&#39;s a rant for another time and &lt;BR&gt;place.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If someone is afraid to try hacking a radio or lacks the &lt;BR&gt;proper &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; tools, they are more than &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; welcome to send them to me and I&#39;ll do it for them and ship &lt;BR&gt;it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; back. As Bruce said, it&#39;s not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for recognition, but it&#39;s to help further the research. I &lt;BR&gt;wouldn&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; be doing this research if it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t for Frank, Bruce, Steve and the others who put in &lt;BR&gt;their time\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and effort. The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possibilities are only limited by our willingness to work &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; together. The more we work &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together, the better the communication will get. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: bruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestig ating@ &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: evp-itc@yahoogroups .com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, April 5, 2008 11:15:21 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] boxes on ebay&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Guy&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do not give in to these demons that are trying to make a\n &lt;BR&gt;buck &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; from the research we love &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the equipment we use.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have given away including the shipping 5 RS boxes for &lt;BR&gt;free, 4, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 470&#39;s and 1 469 all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hacked by me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did not do it to gain popularity or even wanted a thank &lt;BR&gt;you. my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sole motivation was to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bring new people into the research and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in turn change someones life and perpetuate the idea of &lt;BR&gt;strength &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in numbers, in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case strength of communication.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To all new people on this board, do not patronise these &lt;BR&gt;wolves &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that prey on the needs &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wants of others. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The RS 20 -125 is everything the 470 &amp;\n 469 are and a &lt;BR&gt;little more. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; do not let the size or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complicated button arrangement scare you off.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the hack is as simple as the others. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do not buy any RS hacks from ebay, they are sold with the &lt;BR&gt;wrong &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; energy attached to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them, spirit wise.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is why I and all other researchers should follow the &lt;BR&gt;example &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of a great man to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom we owe all of this research.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mr. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to &lt;BR&gt;make a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; substantial amount of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; money from his boxes and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was offered the opportunity on a silver platter. But chose &lt;BR&gt;to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; follow what had been asked &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of him by higher\n entities.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And that was to keep the research pure for research sake. &lt;BR&gt;And &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that at no time was this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equipment or knowledge there of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be for monetary gain.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I adhere to this promise made by Frank to our friends on &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; other side and feel that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is no need to give in to these box &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extortionists. . If a box is not attainable for a new &lt;BR&gt;person yet, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the right way. Then it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably is not their time yet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have coined a phrase and believe in it. &quot;The researcher &lt;BR&gt;does &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; not choose the box, the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box chooses the researcher&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Be patient, those that do not yet have a box. We will\n do &lt;BR&gt;all we &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; can to help you obtain &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: reesclarke_69@ yahoo.com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Fri, 4 Apr 2008 18:49:09 -0700&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Few more traditional evp&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No bodies at fault, but I would do the hack just to help &lt;BR&gt;more &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; people get in this field.
