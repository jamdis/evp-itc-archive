<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>#13 is the coolest looking one i&#x27;ve seen so far, looks straight out 
of a 50&#x27;s sci-fi movie.  I would maybe leave the plug on there too.  
They may be able to come through clearer with all that current 
running through it from the outlet.  It&#x27;s as if they have more 
options, but nobody is really sure how evp works really.  They feed 
off energy and it just seems like you would have more current from a 
wall socket than a couple of batteries.

&gt; This is a box returned. I replaced the capacitors in the whithe 
noise amp 
&gt; that control the gain, and voila--kick butt box. This is one of 
two that I 
&gt; tried &quot;ugly construction&quot;, where the components are mounted on an 
unetched 
&gt; piece of copper clad board in an effort to reduce size. One 
drawback with 
&gt; this box is it&#x27;s AC powered, so not portable to places wihtout 
power--like 
&gt; grave yards, so I might convert it.  I have one more of these, 
#12, but the 
&gt; tuner needs to be replaced.
