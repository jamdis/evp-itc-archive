<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks! More of a figure of speech, as in why give advice when few 
hear it.

&gt; I agree please dont give up Frank. You are the reason I come to 
this 
&gt; site I wanted to learn more about the Franks box and how it works. 
I 
&gt; still find it so mind boggling that you were about to come up with 
a 
&gt; box to communicate with the dead. I have only recorded a few 
session 
&gt; and have already got the message I_see_princess at least the 
spirits 
&gt; all now who started the box research!

&gt; &gt; Please don&#x27;t give up.  I am still learning, and I need a 
teacher.  
&gt; Even though we don&#x27;t know each other.  I try to learn something 
&gt; everday from you, so I will be able to make my own box one day.   
&gt; Even if is a frankinized 12-469, or made from a car stereo.  I 
with 
&gt; ya all the way, even though some stuff I know nothing about, and 
&gt; thats why I learn, to get educated on the subject.  I have already 
&gt; studying basic electronics.

greed 
&gt; and attention seekers, nothing else! And that seems to be all that 
&gt; is sought after on these groups. I don&#x27;t have time for this, and 
&gt; this not what I made the boxes for! 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  Whatever you do don&#x27;t let spirit speak, try to second guess 
&gt; everything, always assume y&#x27;all are so much more advanced.
