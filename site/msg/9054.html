<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Laura.  The current pricing is as follows:

Basic USA Version $399 - Includes Shipping and Insurance
Crystal Enhanced Version  $449 - Includes Shipping and Insurance
The pricing for the soon-to-come advanced MaxiBox has not yet been released.

I think the MiniBox is very different from shack hacks.  I find that I get much more 
technical chatter on it, and not so much from loved ones.  Though there is a group from 
The Big Circle which particularly likes to come through on it.  I prefer the MiniBox results 
second to manual radio sweep, but over the hacked radio shack units.

Of course, everybody will have various opinions about the multitude of techniques and 
models out there, depending on their preferences and the results they get with each 
method.

Given that both manual radio sweep and inexpensive automated sweep units provide fairly 
good results for most people at a far more budget-friendly price, it&#x27;s hard to say whether 
or not the MiniBox is worth the price.  

A couple features the MiniBox offers, that are not available for use on the regular or 
hacked units is, the ability to control both the sensitivity level of the antenna, and the rate 
at which the broadcast spectrum is swept.  This allows for fine tuning, so to speak.

If you go to the paranormalsystems.com web site, there is a video you can watch, showing 
one of the early MiniBoxes and it&#x27;s features.

&gt; Laura, 
&gt;  
&gt; A minibox is a spirit communication box that works on the same premise as Frank&#x27;s box 
or the RS hack.
&gt; It was developed by Paranormal systems and marketed by them for sale. It was put on 
the market before the RS boxes where discovered
&gt; so Because it was smaller than a frank&#x27;s box, I guess they decided to name it the mini 
box. It carried a heavy price tag. 399.00 before
&gt; the production models and 499.00 after.
&gt;  
&gt; It was meant for experienced resaechers and para investigating groups. Not the average 
new person interested in experimenting with box research.
&gt; I own one, but have never quite gotten the caliber of communication that I recieve from 
other boxes. The RS hacks came on the seen shortly after the minibox,
&gt; they worked just as well and you could be up and running for under 50.00. So that kind 
of put the nail in the coffin for the minibox.
&gt;  
&gt; I have gotten information from the inventor and distributer of the minibox, that they 
have a newer more beefed up version they are calling the Maxi box.
&gt; And it should be available before long.

Another question from a new one....what&#x27;s a mini box?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, what&#x27;s a mini box?Logically, I&#x27;d think it is a small version of Frank&#x27;s original box?But, 
experience has taught me never to assume. lol~ Laura
