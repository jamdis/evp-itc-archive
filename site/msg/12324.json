I have the full name to the Seth person. He mentions several \nthings so detailed. He also said he was from 1508 he fell, pain, hot, \nAlso his last name is Saxton or he is from the town of Saxton in \nEngland?? He also said he was in my house behind me behind the couch. \nHave you been hearing the same words? I will try to post the session \nthis weekend.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you  Maritza\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Carol B.&quot; &lt;cbreck@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a puck, and I have been getting the name Seth too.  I also \nhave had\n&gt; my puck give words that are not on the list.\n&gt; \n&gt; Carol B.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m new here, but have been into paranormal research for 6 years \nnow.\n&gt; &gt; I am the type of person that never gets EVP voices with a \nrecorder so\n&gt; &gt; I thought I would experiment with things like the Frank&#39;s box and\n&gt; &gt; Ovilus. I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a cemetery and\n&gt; &gt; field where a church burned down many years ago. I can not get too\n&gt; &gt; specific without having people thinking I am making stuff up but \nit\n&gt; &gt; got fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of the \ntime\n&gt; &gt; we were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of random\n&gt; &gt; stuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved over \nto the\n&gt; &gt; field where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active and\n&gt; &gt; started saying relevant words like cross and priest. The Ovilus \nwas\n&gt; &gt; MUCH more active when being used by our female member. Towards \nthe end\n&gt; &gt; the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me told \nSeth\n&gt; &gt; that she did not want to talk to you I&#39;ve heard bad things about \nyou.\n&gt; &gt; After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she \nstarted\n&gt; &gt; feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head. \nNeedless\n&gt; &gt; to say we ended the session and got out of there.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Over the course of our investigation we found that the Ovilus was\n&gt; &gt; saying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so yesterday \nI\n&gt; &gt; did some test recordings to see what words would come up and one \nof\n&gt; &gt; the first things that came up was: seth  blamed  rest   I am   not\n&gt; &gt; gare   demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me\n&gt; &gt; concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am not \neven\n&gt; &gt; storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the ovilus\n&gt; &gt; saying this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying \naren&#39;t on\n&gt; &gt; the list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the list, \nand\n&gt; &gt; Barry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words he is\n&gt; &gt; getting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger list \nthan\n&gt; &gt; advertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My most important question is is anyone else getting the name \nSeth out\n&gt; &gt; of the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
