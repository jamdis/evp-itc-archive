Yes, this one is not even close to a class "A". I usually jus=

the hall it was only 1 lady and myself. You can hear her speaking and then =
the evp whispers. Considering the events at the time I kept this one.

I am walking down the hall towards the m=

=A0Now=
 bear in mind this is a class B EVP not as good as the others. It may not e=

=A0 That older=A0lady and I had just =
