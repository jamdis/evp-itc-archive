Is it just me thinking this or has the communication and tech end reaching an all time high?
  The more interest in EVP-ITC, Real Time Communication, and positive energy, the better the results!
   
  With the gathering at the Stanley over the weekend, and all the new forms of communication being introduced, we are all getting amazing communication!  I hope it never stops!

  Frank,
   
  The files i heard clearly was the "Frank, i'm talking"and "Thank you, princess".  The other i heard "He's" and "The Voltage", but didn't catch the "Checking" part.  All in all, sounds like a "Frank's Box" to me.  Although boxes automate the raw material, i'm finding that other methods prove success as well.  Even traditional EVP with my Panasonic rr-dr60 is proving to be a positive attribute.  I think once they get in touch with your life signature or aura or whatever they see in us, you can use any method and get great results.  I have used every box and method known and have had success with every one, i keep all my files backed up from this journey for future reference.  My problem is that i don't stay on one style of EVP, i keep jumping around to try new things.  I also have another small project in the works, an idea i passed by Stefan the other day.  I bought an old pocket pc off Ebay that i didn't get yet.  It is a bit older and has a windows CE based program
 installed on it, Stefan seems to believe that EvpMaker might work on that kind of palm pilot because it is a C+++ designed program.  Well, in a couple days i will let you guys know if it works.  If it does, it could be a handheld unit to bring out on location and it has already proved to work great for me and some other researchers on here.
