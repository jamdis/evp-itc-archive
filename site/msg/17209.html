<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s just the radio as it was, just the processor board removed.
Sometimes the radios are crappy sounding when swept, it&#x27;s a crap shoot.

  I had this sony headphone radio, but it wouldn&#x27;t work whwen assemble in a
box. At the end &quot;Earth Is Doomed&quot;

Did you cut the VT wire and connect the sweep board to the radio side? With
a ground wire from the sweep board?

&gt;  Hey Frank! Thats a very nice sounding armband radio. Did you have to add
&gt; a new antenna to the radio? I&#x27;ve been trying to use the 12-580 armband with
&gt; the same sweep circuit (kit23) I&#x27;ve been using and it just doesn&#x27;t want to
&gt; take.... Seeing as though I am stabbing in the dark everytime I try
&gt; something new because I really know little about electronics overall, maybe
&gt; you could provide a suggestion on what I may be missing Frank? anything you
&gt; can tell me about prepping the radio board before adding the circuit (ie:
&gt; cutting a wire or trace or something else)? The only thing I&#x27;ve done is cut
&gt; the mute wire like in past radios. Any thoughts would be great. You have
&gt; used that radio in the past in the Frank&#x27;s Box , right? Hope to hear from
&gt; you.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Chris

&gt;  The never ending quest for a perfect tuner, while varnish dries on other
&gt; boxes. It would help if I really understood how the voices are formed, how
&gt; the sound is actually manipulated. The sound quality of the tuner is vital,
&gt; othere things I&#x27;ve tried, like echo chambers and adding in tones seem to be
&gt; of little help. I&#x27;m not an engineer, all I know is do the sweep thing and
&gt; &quot;they&quot; talk. I don&#x27;t know how to dail up an enitity, and I&#x27;m not wise enough
&gt; to ask questions.
&gt;
&gt;  There&#x27;s some out there that seem to think the box is imperfect and they
&gt; wait fo rthr next stage. All that is a symptom of our siociety, expectingthe
&gt; next programmed advance. I think some are not being told how great they are,
&gt; so the box must not be working correctly. Not so much here on these groups,
&gt; just people I&#x27;ve run into in the past.
&gt;
&gt;  As above, so below! I&#x27;m easily dismissed on this level, and I&#x27;m not sure
&gt; this isn&#x27;t true on high as well.
