This guy puts a ghost sticker over the Radio Shack  name \nand nobody knows. I think if we do the add on Ebay and put the links on  there \nas well as the hacking instruction as well as the yahoo groups like we  would \nall further ourselves.  I just didn&#39;t do it because I did not want to  offend \nanyone on here by doing it without letting everyone know first.  I  have given \naway (4) radio&#39;s away so far to very deserving individuals who could  not get \nthem.  But it still would be nice to let it be known that we are  out there.  \nWe are not a WATCHDOG group but still do not like to see people  taken \nadvantage of for their not knowing.\n \nJeff\n \n \nIn a message dated 4/7/2008 5:28:09 P.M.
