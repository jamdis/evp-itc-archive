So instead of removing the tuner, as these are large\n&gt;&gt; boards, just add a sweep board. It&#39;s the same thing Hultay does. It has\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; advange of much better sound, since you&#39;re using he amplifiers and\n&gt;&gt; speakers\n&gt;&gt; that it was designed with. This also has the built in tape deck.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   The radio is kind of a crap shoot, as some are all digital, and the\n&gt;&gt; tuner\n&gt;&gt; is tuned with software, usually IC-to-IC(ICsquared) a language put out by\n&gt;&gt; Philips. Some car tuners use this, and I even had a couple Arm Band radio\n&gt;&gt; that are all digital tuning.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   F-S\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  On Thu, Nov 25, 2010 at 10:27 AM, Mvanah Maloti\n&gt;&gt; &lt;inyanga4@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;              Whoa.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  That&#39;s wild, Frank!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  I admit to having a very limited scope and knowledge of electronics in\n&gt;&gt; general and how these things are built and actually function\n&gt;&gt; specifically,\n&gt;&gt; but still, opening them up and showing us &quot;the works&quot; like this just\n&gt;&gt; boggles\n&gt;&gt; my mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Thanks for doing what ya do, lol!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Converting an AM/FM/Cassette/CD player is great.
