Look at it the other way: if the number of bytes were \n       =\r\n DIFFERENT, than you&#39;d know the files HAD changed, and you could stop \n    =\r\n    testing.&nbsp; But if the number of bytes are the same, it tends to \n  =\r\n      indicate the files are likely the same, but you still need a low leve=\r\nl \n        file comparison to be sure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My method is to compare the f=\r\niles \n        using the CMP command in unix.&nbsp; There are many programs =\r\nto compare \n        files, but you have to be careful not to use one that d=\r\noes a \n        line-by-line compare (or a comparison meant for text files),=\r\n since text \n        files can be different at a low level, but look essent=\r\nial the same in an \n        editor (because of the way spaces and tabs and =\r\nnew lines work between \n        editors and platforms).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But anyway, =\r\nthe way to compare is with a \n        program that can compare binary files=\r\n, not text files.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On \n        &lt;b&gt;Sun, 5/10/09, April Abercro=\r\nmbie \n        &lt;i&gt;&lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

However, for wav \n                                files, th=\r\ne compression during email is not loss \n                                les=\r\ns. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n                                &lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Myriad =\r\nPro&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n                                &lt;div&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;I used to \n                             =\r\n   think as you do, in that the emailed \n                                at=\r\ntachment&nbsp;of a wav file would not loose \n                              =\r\n  anything. After a lengthy discourse with another \n                       =\r\n         member here, I learned that I was wrong. The \n                    =\r\n            reason why&nbsp;I did not realize it in the \n                  =\r\n              first place is that when I would email a wav \n               =\r\n                 file, I would intentionally keep it in very \n             =\r\n                   small segments, to keep file size down. This was \n      =\r\n                          just for ease of transfer. But because of this, \n=\r\n                                I had not experienced any noticeable \n     =\r\n                           loss.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n                             =\r\n   &lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n          =\r\n                      &lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Now it may =\r\n\n                                be in some cases, depending on the servers=\r\n or \n                                what have you that the file goes throu=\r\ngh, that \n                                the loss may be less or more. But=\r\n once the \n                                attachment is \n                 =\r\n               downloaded,&nbsp;the&nbsp;quality&nbsp;has been \n           =\r\n                     found to be less then the original \n                  =\r\n              wav.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n                                &lt;div&gt;&lt;font =\r\nface=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n                        =\r\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Again though \n           =\r\n                     you can only really tell when the&nbsp;wav file \n     =\r\n                           is large.&lt;/f\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}
