<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Mark that would be great if you could send those to me. Ive got 
some electronics experience repairing coin op video machines and have 
done a bit of work on the i.c. boards themselves.

&gt; &gt; Could anybody help?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Beyond modifying a radio or other piece of electronics I want to 
&gt; &gt; assemble a box from scratch. However I am in need of some 
&gt; schematics. 
&gt; &gt; Where could I find those?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; Hey Tom,
&gt; I&#x27;m new here so I just saw your message. I have downloaded several 
&gt; schematics from the internet for different versions of the box as I 
&gt; could find them. If you want me to send them along to you, drop me 
a 
&gt; line. Like you, I want to build one but I lack the expertise and 
&gt; knowledge when it comes to electronics so not only do I have to 
find 
&gt; the right box to build, but also someone to help me out with 
&gt; constructing it as well. 
&gt; I have a group here in the La Crosse area but both of my techs left 
&gt; to start their own group with some of our other members. So much 
for 
&gt; my tech department. Anyway, let me know if you want me to send them 
&gt; along to you. They are all in pdf format. Take care and we&#x27;ll talk 
&gt; with you again soon.
&gt; 
&gt; Mark Waldenberger
