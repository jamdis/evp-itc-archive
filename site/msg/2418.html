How much will it cost to fix your little dog?  Certainly we all  can kick in a few bucks to help you; you've been more than generous  with your sharing of your research  and  boxes.  Give us  a figure and maybe some of us will help  Princess.

 It's not a question of whether or not the break can be set,  the question is "How much money do you have?" At this moment--I hate  this place, and humanity sucks!

Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] So is this proof-ative?

            A trip to the vet will answer that question, usually most  breaks can be set unless there is another underlying problem. It is a  cute lil dog, sometimes they are very fragile bone structures because  of breeding. There are a few small dogs that seem to have alot of  problems with bad backs and breaking legs/feet. 
   
  I think its proof to those who want it, and as for me...nobody is  talking about me on the radio, or using my full name...so it definitely  gets my attention when my name is being used in context with things  that are going on around me or happening to people I know.
   
  I dont need any proof, they just give it freely so I can share or in some cases not share with everyone.
   
  I stopped lookin for proof right about the time this all started.  My first evp was all that I needed to get me on this path. My mothers  voice, so long after shes been passed, friends, relatives, or even  perfect strangers who I had no clue about until I found out after the  fact....way too many proofs have been freely given to me, and I never  asked for one. Earl and Bob Cox, I think thats one of my favorite WOW  moments, not knowing about Erland Babcock it was an easy  misunderstanding. Luckily I make everything phonetic so it was easy to  catch later. I have listened to others evp from him since then and I  often STILL hear earl and bob cox. They have also given me names of  workers on this side who I have bumped into later tho I usually put off  contacting anyone they mention until I think the time is  right. Usually it is just weird to find out its a REAL LIVE person  and that they just happen to be in the EVP/ITC field. 
   
  I used to always assume when they say a name they are talking  about spirits there. Or that if I get an ITC image its a spirit face.  They proved thats a wrong assumption on several occasions. Probably the  only time I ever asked for anything was while doing an itc session,  after so many faces I just wanted them to show me something else,  anything else, "show me something different" led to a few portraits of  the living.
   
  Sometimes they speak the truth, sometimes a wayward thought creeps  threw that shouldnt (or just a creep)... as for the dog...take it to  the vet and see what they can do then you will know more.

       When you get a voice that talks about a specific situation,  does that prove something is talking that is not a broadcast fragment?  We do have a dog with a broken leg, so it would seem outrageous to  suggest the comment received about a dog and a break would be just a  stray broadcast. I hate to have an animal suffer, but what a piece of  evidence! This is what I mean  by judging content and  context. 
 
 I don't ask questions, I did not ask  about the dog. I was only testing the #24 box, and announced, as  usuall, that I was doing an EVP recording to test the box.
