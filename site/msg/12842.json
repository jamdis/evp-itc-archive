It turned out quite well. I think manual sweep works great. I \nhave been doing ITC work for a few years now. I post a few things \nonline now and then in my galleries. You can access those from my \nwebpage\n&gt; \n&gt; http://misty.xm.com\n&gt; \n&gt; and a few more things are posted on \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.bestpsychicnetwork.info/profile/Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; Keep up the good work!\n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 11/18/08, marie32711 &lt;m.mickley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Misty,\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the reply, i too enjoy the manual method of\n&gt; &gt; getting itc/evp\n&gt; &gt; then again i cannot afford to get anything other than\n&gt; &gt; that!! But i do \n&gt; &gt; think that if i am gettting such great results using this\n&gt; &gt; method, \n&gt; &gt; then why change? I have such specific results...getting the\n&gt; &gt; wonderful \n&gt; &gt; spirits that visit me to repeat words...and they have said\n&gt; &gt; things to \n&gt; &gt; me that wewe to specific to just be radio\n&gt; &gt; chatter...including both \n&gt; &gt; mine and my fiance&#39;s nicknames as children. (both VERY\n&gt; &gt; strange \n&gt; &gt; names!!!)I have had accusations that i fake it, but to be\n&gt; &gt; honest \n&gt; &gt; other than the fact i wouldnt know how to fake it, i have\n&gt; &gt; no desire \n&gt; &gt; to do so, being slightly sceptical when i started doing\n&gt; &gt; this, i have \n&gt; &gt; been blown away by the results i have acheived!!\n&gt; &gt; As i mentioned before i have some videos on\n&gt; &gt; youtube(mazblondie) and \n&gt; &gt; it would be FANTASTIC if you could take a look and see what\n&gt; &gt; you think.\n&gt; &gt; Have you been recording long?\n&gt; &gt; Do you have any video;s recordings to listen to??\n&gt; &gt; Marie\n&gt;\nThanks misty willl take a look x"}
