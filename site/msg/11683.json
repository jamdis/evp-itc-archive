I use an attached flash at night or in ow light.  You can also use a higher speed film although if you are going to anlarge your photos very much they will be grainier.  I use digital cameras too but love my 35 mm and have gotten some of my best photos with it.\n\n                             Rheta\n---- Chad &lt;cawiggins78@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Hey Guys,\n&gt; \n&gt; Any of you still use a 35mm to take pictures with? I have 2 of them\n&gt; and tried over the weekend to utilize them in an investigation. The\n&gt; exposure time on these things is like 30 seconds. It&#39;s such a pain in\n&gt; the butt. If you do use the 35mm, what kind of settings do you use?\n&gt; Any advice? I am totally new to night photography. Has everyone gone\n&gt; to digital now or what?\n&gt; \n&gt; Chad\n&gt;"}
