&gt; &gt; Hi Frank,
&gt; &gt; I tried everything known to man before the extream had to be 
&gt; taken, along with Kidney cancer I don&#x27;t think I had to many 
options. 
&gt; Oh well life dishes it out, and you serve it up the best you can.
&gt; &gt; I just wish I could have had the opportunity to have had 
&gt; alternative options. Not in my cards in this life time.

&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s been my exopereince that alternative treatments may be more 
&gt; &gt; effective, such as Oil of Oregano. Heart burn might mean there&#x27;s 
a 
&gt; &gt; bateria in the stomach, but what do I know?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I will, I have had this since Monday, and my lady is the one 
&gt; &gt; pushing me to go. I&#x27;m a man (maybe a stupid man) and the only 
&gt; &gt; reason I would go to the Doctor is if I&#x27;m kicking the bucket. 
The 
&gt; &gt; only furneral I will go to is my own, and I&#x27;m not sure if I will 
&gt; &gt; even go to that one.lol I&#x27;ll be ok, and thanks for the concerns.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I also have acid reflux and it makes me miserable some times. 
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; take a Zantac and it goes away. Thats just fine with me.
