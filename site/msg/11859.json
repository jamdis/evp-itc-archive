This seems to be an entity collective \n&gt;&gt; who enjoy teasing EVP researchers. They caused a lot of annoyance to other \n&gt;&gt; researchers in the past, but nothing serious. Some seemed to be afraid of \n&gt;&gt; them, but I never really heard of them doing anymore than being annoying \n&gt;&gt; and prankish and sometimes, well, actually pretty damned funny on occasion.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Ann\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; On Aug 17, 2008, at 12:42 PM, Pridegrl Neverumind wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; i have tried looking online for more info about these nefarious \n&gt;&gt;&gt; fish-ppl.... anyone have a link to info?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; thanks\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Charm\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- On Sun, 8/17/08, Lisby &lt;lisby@earthlink. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Lisby &lt;lisby@earthlink. net&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Ahhh the infamous Fish!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Received: Sunday, August 17, 2008, 8:39 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Shit, Frank--I got one the other day that I haven&#39;t even pulled as a clip \n&gt;&gt;&gt; yet that says, &quot;Believe in the fish.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Great.

Just when you think you&#39;re getting great evidiecne \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and proo, it turns out to be these tricky jokers. Another reason not to \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take everything a gospel truth.  I think it was thoise researchers in \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Luxemberg(?) that first got these guys, but I don&#39;t remeber for sure. So \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if you hear any reference to fish, that&#39;s a clue that they are there. I \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; am uncertain if they are bad guys, or just tricksters.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; See what people are saying about Windows Live.
