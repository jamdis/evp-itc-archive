In fact, the box spoke to me from across a large room -- I&#39;d guess about 20 or 30 feet away and from a platform about 10 feet above me -- in a distinctive voice and speech pattern that I recognized immediately.  \n\nI&#39;d asked a rhetorical question. The box answered. That rattled me, big time.  After that, I stuck close to the box.  I wanted to hear more.\n\nHowever, at no time did this involve payment of any kind.  In fact, innate skeptic that I am (having been badly burned by one regrettable association), I watched Chris and Dina closely during the weekend.  I saw zero hustling or salesmanship. They never asked me for money, and have never asked me to talk about my experiences with the box.\n\nMy interest in the boxes and this list are unabashedly self-serving:  I want to understand why some devices work better than others, why some of us hear them more clearly than others, who the voices really are (if they&#39;re not who they seem to be), and the significance of what they&#39;re saying.  I want to hear more.\n\nI don&#39;t have the expertise to build a box, and I can&#39;t afford to hire someone to build one for me, right now.  So, I&#39;m on this list, listening vicariously to others&#39; experiences and recordings.\n\nI&#39;m grateful for those who share their insights, experiences, thoughts on how we can understand this stuff better, and the recordings of voices that keep talking & talking.\n\nThanks again, Frank!\n\nRelieved,\nFiona\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Well, I was very reluctant, despite all the insults and attacks, but I hit the banned button. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S \n&gt;"}
