I don&#39;t agree with how Chris uses the boxes, but he may hear a different level that I do, or.. I don&#39;t hear waht he does, and he doesn&#39;t hear what I do, but that&#39;s pretty much the same ofr everyone. Chrsi has some &quot;cherrished&quot; theories, I guess they&#39;d be called, about how the bopxes work, I have no idea how it works.Chris thinks the box use should be restricted, I think it should be open to all. Other than that we agree. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; You keep typing, we keep giving.

Everyone, who wants to do research/testing should be allowed to do it! I totally disagree with Chris&#39; perceptions on this subject!  =Judy="}
