You are welcome, but this is not Laura, but LC.  LOL!  You are having 
issues down there!  Laura has also been helping too, of course.

&gt; Laura   Thanks for the coaching tips.  I will try all of what you 
suggest.  On the 31st a friend will be bringing an antenna booster 
here from the U.S.  Meanwhile I will keep working with EVP maker.  
Patience is probably my biggest obstacle but persistence is on my 
side.   I have had a taste of success and I like it.  I will post any 
results.   Thanks again   Ron L

&gt; I visited Mayan ruins in the Progresso/Merida region about 5 years 
&gt; ago...fascinating to me and very spiritual.
&gt; 
&gt; I just want to encourage you. Set-up a certain time to run sessions 
&gt; weekly. Let&#x27;s say you could do it Monday -Thursday at 10:00 AM for 
&gt; example. This way, an expectation is set and a plan is in order. 
&gt; Keep recording small sessions and then analyze them. Ask questions, 
&gt; simple basic questions for responses each day. Don&#x27;t give up. I 
&gt; pesonally have noticed this has helped me and something is building 
&gt; with the contacts and quality of the messages. For me it began with 
&gt; a staggered &quot;Yes,&quot; and other one words occasionally. Now I am 
&gt; hearing sentences and very intelligable responses that I know are 
not 
&gt; radio bit coincidences. The biggest help any of us can give you is 
&gt; to remain patient and continue experimenting, looking for not only 
&gt; what works for you, but giving those on the other side time to find 
&gt; you and get a message or two across. It will come - I am certain of 
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; For some reason, the amount of audio bits seem to help with the 
&gt; communication, as I can tell...even when I have received EVP-like 
&gt; messages above or over the audio bits in the background. I do not 
&gt; understand why. Here are two ideas I have for you to pick up more 
AM 
&gt; audio:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Try an AM antenna booster (Radio Shack sells them. I think Juli 
&gt; has had some success with hers).
&gt; 2) You may try more than one hacked radio sweeping at different 
&gt; places on the band. Pipe the audio through a mixer, and output it 
&gt; through amplified speakers or directly into the recorder. This way, 
&gt; you wil have audio bits throughout - even if you have to use 3 
radios 
&gt; to do it.

&gt; &gt; Laura I am on the Yucatan peninsula. The very tip of the

me

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks all for getting back so quickly. It probably 
&gt; makes me feel a bit better if nothing is on the recording since I 
&gt; don&#x27;t seem to pick anything up anyway. The &quot;Ask Bruce is a bit of 
&gt; surprise only because I already did ask bruce. He had suggested I 
&gt; try a direct recording. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This actually brings up a question about what Steve hears. Is 
&gt; it possible that you are getting a message given to you at the time 
&gt; you are listening to my recording which actually does not have the 
&gt; message? I must say I am still overwhelmed from getting messages on 
&gt; the other evp maker recording (that others hear). My pea brain and 
&gt; body are still processing that information. 
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; I have posted a direct recording in my file under 
&gt; RS12-469 Direct Recording. This may be a good opportunity to get 
&gt; help with my technical challange here in Mexico. I have posted what 
&gt; I recorded from AM signals along the beach here on the Gulf with 
the 
&gt; recorder patched directly into the RS 12 469. Most channels are 
&gt; Spanish language although one or two channels skip across the Gulf 
&gt; fromTexas. So you shouldn&#x27;t hear many English words from the radio 
&gt; if any.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am submitting this because, with the help of this group, I 
&gt; recently learned that I have been missing all the messages on my 
&gt; recordings. That is...I couldn&#x27;t hear anything where others with 
&gt; experience hear plenty.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My previous post was with EVP make r. If somethng could be 
&gt; heard on the RS recording patched directly into my recorder that 
&gt; would be another amazing event for me. I of course hear nothing 
from 
&gt; the other side. Ron L
