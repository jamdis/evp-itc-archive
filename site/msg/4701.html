<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Robin-- I have watched this clip and it is the least convincing of  
all the ones I have seen of him with the box. I have heard several  
where some of the audio is clear enough to stand on its own without  
his interpretation, and where his interpretation generally agrees. I  
have also heard some where the audio I hear disagrees with his  
interpretation, but not to such a high degree that I was overtly  
troubled by it--it was in what I would call the high-end of my  
tolerance range for subjectivity.  I have heard audio where the  
person asking questions of the box clearly heard answered that  
appeared to move them greatly without dependance on Chris&#x27;s  
interpretation.

So, to try to sum up for you, my personal investigation led me to  
believe that something was happening with the box. I did not always  
agree with Chris&#x27;s interpretation, but it appeared the same or close  
to what I heard a high enough percentage of the time that I was  
willing to accept he was not faking it, but giving it an honest  
enough go. It led me to start hounding Frank for a box of my own, and  
later to buy a minibox from Rick, since poor Frank was beset on all  
sides. ;)

We&#x27;ve already had some spectacularly burning arguments about what  
Chris claims his guides or technicians tell him behind closed doors.  
As far as I know, no audio of this is public, so his claims can&#x27;t be  
evaluated. I think the proliferation of people getting results with  
the boxes belies his assertion that only 30 are chosen.

&gt; what you all think. I&#x27;ve watched/listened to this video a number of

&gt; for
&gt; them what is being said. I&#x27;m disappointed because I honestly can&#x27;t
&gt; hear the words he&#x27;s repeating as being from spirit.
