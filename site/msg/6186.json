Our file area is filling up quick so I have been thinking of ways we can organize it.

It would be absolutely great if it were possible to have SUBJECT FILES for items such as 1) Technical info for RS Hacks, mini, FB etc.   2) messages regarding techs from the other side   3) Protection Ideas   4) other specific subjects but often asked question by new members like me.   I don&#39;t know what the capacity for all files is but setting up files on commonly asked questions would save newbees a lot of time as well as those helpful, experienced researchers who willingly answer the same questions over and over.  Newbees could refer to the subject list and move on.   Ron\n\nMisty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:         Cool will try and check those out. Hey Bruce can ya please make yourself one folder there in the main directory and call it Bruce&#39;s files or Bruce Halliday&#39;s EVP, trying to keep that section organized so its easier to find peoples stuff. You can make as many subfolders in your folder as you like, one for each box type if you like.\n   \n  Gonna do some cleaning on there soon and get rid of some of the ones that are no longer posting here or unjoined. Dont want to do that but we need the space.
