<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Oh, at 31 seconds i say &quot;It&#x27;s pretty good for this radio&quot; and then i hear them say &quot;It&#x27;s Better&quot;

It&#x27;s good when they tell me things.  By the way, this radio and circuit is running on a 9v supply.

&gt; I originally sent this video to Jeff, but i thought it would be cool to share it.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, it shows what i do while building a circuit.  The voltage from the radio from one end of the band to the other is roughly 2v-9v, so the goal is to make a sweep circuit to match what the radio puts out.
&gt; 
&gt; You can see in this video, that i got the radio to sweep between 2v-7v.  That means it&#x27;s covering more than 3/4 of the bandwidth, which is excellent.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been testing different versions of this circuit, but couldn&#x27;t get it to come close until today.
&gt; 
&gt; This stuff is NOT easy to build, especially how frank does it.  I&#x27;m focusing mainly on the circuit, but frank build everything from scratch with the exception of maybe the tuner.
&gt; 
&gt; I think you will find the video interesting.  The yellow box is my multimeter, it shows me what the circuit is doing.  You can do the same thing with a scope.
