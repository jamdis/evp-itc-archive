As to your question as to my favorite method, it would\nbe the one that was developed and tested under the best  controlled\nconditions possible, and has given the most reliable results. Given\nthat, I am still searching for a method I would say I like, since my\nexperience has been that the more controlled the experiment, the less\nconvincing the results.  Which is worrisome, as far as confirming the\ntheories in general go.\n\nDid I answer your question, or did you have a comments on my observations?\n\nSince you are one of the researchers, perhaps you can answer some of\nthe questions I asked in my previous post:\n\n&quot;How did you go about that?  Did you do exactly five 30 second clips?\n Or did you do more, and send in just the best?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nightparanormalresearch&quot;\n&lt;nightparanormalresearch@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Iam just wondering how long you have been doing I.T.C/E.V.P research \n&gt; and analasis Iam one of the 8 researchers Mike asked to help him in his \n&gt; project. The files he posted are his own. As for my files I am still \n&gt; working on them and after I send them to Mike and he is ok with me \n&gt; sharing them I have no problem posting them or sending them to you. I \n&gt; would be very interested in your opinion. On the other hand I have many \n&gt; files you may find interesting I am currently working on putting them \n&gt; up on esnips http://www.esnips.com/web/nightparanormalresearchsStuff\n&gt; thats the link to a couple and theres more to come in the future. enjoy\n&gt; back to my original question how long have you been involved with I.T.C \n&gt; and what is your favorite method of capturing I.T.C.\n&gt; \n&gt;                       Thanx Mike W.\n&gt;"}
