The robotic allophone type sound leaves \nto many possible conclusions for my brain &quot;sounds like/could be&quot; and I \ndid listen to your file but even after amplification I was unable to \ndecide what I thought I heard. &quot;your wife wont care if she likes you&quot; \nDefinitely different than what others think they hear in it.\n\nI always go back to who did the recording. What do you hear? The \nmessages are meant for your ears not mine so that usually plays a key \nrole in what comes thru.\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stephen &lt;evpresearch@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; at around 4am Sunday I started recording while I sat here on the \n&gt; computer and recorded this &quot;robotic&quot; voice. I cannot make out what is \n&gt; being said. Could someone listen and let me know what they hear.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you\n&gt; Stephen ..\n&gt;"}
