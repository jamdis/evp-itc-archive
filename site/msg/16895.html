New evidence is constantly being analyzed.=C2=A0 But, as I said, the eviden=
ce I have checked out was not convincing. And yes, this is evidence "per se=
".=C2=A0 As you put it, it is evidence of "something that should not be the=
re".=C2=A0 And my point is, all of this evidence I have heard, is evidence =
of something that is completely reasonable to be there: noise and radio bro=
adcasts.

And I still don't understand why those who analyze evidence (pick=
ing it apart, as you call it), you feel must be name called, insulted, and =
referred to as a "clown", because they are skeptical of these claims, and d=
ecide not to simply believe the claims.

But critical thinking is just thin=
king logically.=C2=A0 If someone presents claims, and includes a=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 disclaimer about not being allowed to think logically when viewing the =
evidence, I'm afraid it would not be unexpected for those claims to be ridi=
culed.=C2=A0 Maybe that is why you have such bad experiences when presentin=
g your findings?

There is no need for there to be such friction between EV=
P researchers, and skeptics.=C2=A0 As long as each group could agree that t=
he basis for analyzing evidence is to be allowed to think logically.
