OK thanks.

Though I'm no expert, isn't this sort of the way the scanning b=
oxes work in general?=A0 By scanning the broadcast frequencies, they are "c=
utting and pasting", so to speak, words from whatever happens to be on that=
 frequency at the time the scan hits it into an audio stream?=A0 If so, the=
n it seems to me that the difference between people doing the cut and paste=
, and the box doing it, is that people are making their own interpretations=
 before the final audio steam is constructed, and with the box the people a=
re making subjective interpretations after the final audio stream is constr=
ucted.=A0 So there is no difference in the overall methodology, just the sp=
ecific point where the person injects their own opinions?
