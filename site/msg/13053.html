<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>To insure this testing is objective, wouldn&#x27;t it have been best not 
to inform everyone what kind of disaster these items were from? Now 
that everyone knows they are from a plane crash, that will set up the 
prejudice of hearing plane/travel related words in the evp noises.
And as you probably know, once that prejudice is active, once I say
&quot;Doesn&#x27;t that sound like someone saying &quot;Sssssstewardesssss...&quot;, then
everyone hears THAT word, rather than just noise, or, for example 
&quot;Stewed ass&quot;.

And, if something does sound like a plane/travel related word, it 
will now be highlighted as an example of why this was a successful 
test, and the other less-relevant words ignored.  This is a form of 
confirmation bias, which again, hurts the value of the test.

A more objective way would have been to send out both crash related 
items, and completely innocuous items, with no explanation of where 
each was from, and see what kind of EVPs were returned on each.  
Further, the returned EVPs should then be returned to someone to 
evaluate who ALSO doesn&#x27;t know the origin of the objects, so that 
they do not torture the interpretations into the forms you hope and 
expect them to be (again, plane/travel related).  While this test of 
course lacks all kinds of controls, this would at least be a start to 
defining a double-blind test, which is the gold standard for good 
research in this kind of research.

Even though you have tried to keep some of the information quiet, 
there is still quite a large opportunity for guessing and 
coincidence.  For example, one person might assume this was from an 
airshow (since, as you said, the event was very fast, and many people 
saw it), and so only send in EVPs that would be relevant to that 
situation (I.e. Not sending in child-like sounds, or sending in 
sounds that sound like scratchy tower or inter-plane 
communication).    If the crash was a commercial airline, then dozens 
of different people could have been killed, which means you could 
find SOME relevancy no matter what noises are returned to you: 
practical any word, name, or sound will support some speculation that
it could have been relevant to one of those people. 

I do think it is a good idea to test your theories. But my purpose 
here is to suggest ways to help these tests be as objective as 
possible, and for your efforts and testing to be as worth while as 
possible, and for the youtube video results you make to be as 
valuable and bulletproof as possible.  But I am concerned that the 
above scenario is full of opportunity for subjectivity and 
misinterpretation.</pre>
