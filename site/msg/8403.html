Bruce,
 
Is there the possibility that there was an entity was already in  this 
person's house?  And that once a portal was opened and closed that  entity re-opened 
the portal?  Has this researcher done another session to  see if there are 
any current entities residing in his house?  This is the  main reason I am not 
allowed to do box sessions in my house for this may happen  there.

for all researchers,

THIS IS NOT FOR THE REASON OF PUSHING A PANIC  BUTTON OR A MATTER OF 
GIVING IN TO FEAR. 

It is simply an incident  that I feel researchers should be aware of 
as a possibility. Given in my  opinion the boxes do open a portal due 
to the connection necessary for  real time two way communication, and 
the wide spread belief that entities  can and do manipulate physical 
objects when in the presence of  them.

I have just been made aware of a situation that has happened to a  
fairly new researcher whom I believe to be honest and  forthcoming.

the incident involved the aftermath of a regular RS box  session. The 
researcher had finished his session with the practice of  asking that 
any entities that may have traveled through the box, return  and asked 
for conformation, then proceeded to end the session and turn the  box 
off. he was assured that he turned the box off by going back to the  
recording after the incident and validating verbally that he did in  
fact turn off the box.

He left the room for a few moments , when he  returned he allegedly 
witnessed a white cloud move across the room and  noticed that his RS 
box was turned on and running.

This is actually  the first instance I have encountered where the 
possibility of an entity  that may have

purposely stayed behind to turn the box back on and let  other 
entities through. matter of fact

that concept has not  occurred to me before. but now sounds very 
possible.

This may even  happen at times we are never aware of and they actually 
turn the box on  and when 
whatever comes through is through they turn it off again and we  are 
none the wiser.

I will definitely address this in my sessions,  what I suggest is 
until we come to a mutual agreement among  researchers
on this occurrence, I think it best that when we end a session  we 
remove at least one battery from the box to prevent it being  turned
back on.

Bruce
