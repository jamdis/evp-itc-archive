It amazes me that regardless of the devices we seem to use, with the right determination, the other side seems to comply.  I just wonder if they know just how hard we are trying.  If anyone seen my original set up, I would have been committed into the funny farm.  I had tinfoil attached to an antenna hanging out my window just to get good reception.  As crazy as it sounds, If that was the only way to get a good session, then I was doing it! LOL

        Wow, Laura, "something a little different" is an understatement. 
What method did you use to capture this? I can hear you and a very 
robotic voice echoing what you've said (e.g., when you were asking it 
a question you asked Yes? and the robotic voice replied Yes.)

BTW I don't it makes any difference whether you're scanning in 
Spanish or English; i.e., I think you can get replies in any language.

Sharon
