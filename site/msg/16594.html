<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, I finally got my own ghost box put together in a single, portable package.
I call it &quot;Tom&#x27;s Toob&quot; (Tube).

Its a 25 inch long, 2&quot;/id peice of PVC pipe, painted black. It has two slots
cut into its right half, near the center just big enough to accomidate the lower
half of a hacked 587 radio in one and an Avon &quot;SpaFinder&quot; sleep noise generator
in the other. The loudspeakers of both thus open inside the tube while the
controls remain outside the pipe and are easily accessible. I must say that
the resonance and sound mixing in the tube are great. The noise generator has
several different random sounds that might be useful, like a fairly clean &quot;white
noise&quot;, a &quot;water fall&quot; sound and a &quot;running stream&quot; sound with a volume control.
Other sounds like &quot;wind chimes&quot; &quot;jungle&quot;, etc. likely are less useful, but might
be fun to play with.

It seems to work, but I miss a lot---I need more practice, I suppose. 
&quot;Bradley&quot;, a deceased friend of mine said his name-- and It did sound like his
voice. When I asked how he died--he replied &quot;accident!&quot;--which is true--he
drove his car under a moving train.--he said more, but I couldnt make it
out---gotta get the tape recorder running.

The picture of Tom&#x27;s Toob should be in my album. My omly problem is that I
might need to speed the scan up just a bit. It there a capacitor or resistor I
can add to do this?

I like the fact that the pipe is easy to carry in one hand or on my shoulder. I
was inspired to use a pipe to house the components by a recent episode of &quot;Ghost
adventures&quot;--they only had a radio in theirs though.</pre>
