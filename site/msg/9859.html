<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all,

I think the best results would be achieved if the speech recognition
software is trained by actual SpeakJet-synthesized speech (rather than
trying to imitate the robotic, monotonous SJ sound). In the SJ
manual http://www.speechchips.com/downloads/speakjetusermanual.pdf there
is a table of all allophones with pronunciation examples.

The &#x27;Play List&#x27; of Audition/Cool Edit could be used to create sequences
of cues/allophones, to synthesize the words/sentences for the training.

I&#x27;ve uploaded some files to my folder
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Stefan/Speech%20Recognition%20Training/
to show the process. Of course, it would be a rather laborious procedure
to synthesize all the sentences necessary for the training, but, well,
that&#x27;s the way science is! ;-)

My example of the synthesized sentence &quot;Hello, good morning&quot; might not
be the correct pronunciation, but I&#x27;m sure you as native English
speakers can do it much better than me. :)

(BTW, many EVP examples sound much more clear and fluent than my above
example...)

&gt; I don&#x27;t know if that would work. I remember back in the day, which was
&gt; a Wednesday by the way (lol), you used to have to train the program to
&gt; recognize your speech. I don&#x27;t know if that has changed since then.
