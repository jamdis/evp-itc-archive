Just wondering if it is just me or am I \ndoing it all wrong? I bring a voice recorder that uses a standard \nrecording tape and can&#39;t hear anything unusual. Any suggestions on how \nI can try to get some voices would be great. I am open-minded to the \nspirit world and have seen spirits but not heard from them. Would like \nto try to capture some voices. Any suggestions would be great!\n\nThanks very much,\n\nJan\n\n\n\n                           \n\n       \r\n--0-550427191-1211778785=:79204\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Hi Jan&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Hmmm well I would like to pretend I know why some people get evp with little effort while others do not.
