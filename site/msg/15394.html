<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Weird and wild!

I was contacted by some people in a nearby city who had inherited the house
their mother and father left behind. Their father had died about a year
earlier and their mother died 3 months after him. They had three very
strange messages left on their answering machine. The first one freaked them
out so much they erased it but they kept the other two. I copied the
recordings onto a pocket digital voice recorder and tried to do some
processing on the audio, which is very garbled and distorted. But I did get
that it was their father trying to leave them messages.

They haven&#x27;t had any strange happenings since, so I guess their father went
somewhere else eventually.

&gt;  I AC powered TRF-3 but it was picking up some static, so I added a three
&gt; wire power cord so the box can be grounded, that got rid of the noise. I
&gt; ground the circuit ground buss to the AC ground wire.
