I did the first long bike ride of the season, with a \nheadwind most of the way, only twenty miles, but it was grueling. I \nwas wiped out till about 8pm. \n\n I now have a low voltage warning light for systems with gel cells, \nor other rechargable batteries. Probably should just incorporate it \nin the circuits, the sweep will run at low voltages, but you get less \nand less of the top of the bands as the battery voltage drops. \n\n Frank-S\n\n --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;misujoey&quot; &lt;Debbie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Please join www.livescifi.TV &lt;http://www.livescifi.tv/&gt;  &quot;In Search \nof \n&gt; the\n&gt; Paranormal&quot;, as they perform a LIVE Interactive ITC Session.
