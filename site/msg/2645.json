There&#39;s no way that \nimage could&#39;ve been generated naturally.\n\nRemember the old days when TV&#39;s had tuning knobs?  You could adjust it so \nyou had the best picture. Or tune it completely off-channel.  Modern ones \njust don&#39;t work that way.\n\nSomewhere in my junquebox I still have an ancient UHF converter from the \nearly days of UHF, when most TV&#39;s didn&#39;t have it.  You set your TV to \nchannel 2, I believe, and turned a knob on the front to tune in UHF \nstations.\n\nZack\n\nOn Fri, 26 Oct 2007, Frank Sumption wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You?ve slowed the recording down?

While there is lot of information available on the proper normal function of a tuned TV there is little about what badly tuned TVs do! In this case, it looks as though the two images may be from different slightly different times. I?m not an expert in TV operation so I don?t know if this is expected behaviour for detuned TVs. From a little research, it seems likely that the horizontal retrace signals are getting screwed up, due to the bad reception, meaning the screen is not updating correctly, leaving old signals still visible. It would be well worth researching this subject.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Te guy is a friggin &#39; moron!\n&gt;\n&gt; I didn&#39;t answer this time--I&#39;m not like anymore!
