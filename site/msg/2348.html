&gt; Yes, I have heard of this.  
&gt; 
&gt; I remember one woman speaking of being on a beach and walking 
right 
&gt; out of her body.  This is different from the meditation type of 
OBE 
&gt; and is often referred to as an SOBE - or &quot;spontaneous out of body 
&gt; experience.&quot;  I believe this is what you are describing.  
&gt; 
&gt; The following link has an interesting article:

&gt; &gt; Just kicking around some thoughts in my head, and nobody is up 
&gt; tonight to share thier ideas so I am writing it down anyway while 
&gt; it&#x27;s fresh in my thoughts. 
&gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt;   I know and understand pretty well about OOB&#x27;s and have read 
&gt; peoples experiences. So far all of my disembodied experiences were 
&gt; while I was &quot;unconcious&quot; with little to verify any of the 
&gt; experiences as being anything but a dream state. However lately I 
&gt; have begun to do something again that I havent done since I was a 
&gt; small child. 
&gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt;   You know how it is when you wake up in the morning hit the 
&gt; snooze button, roll over and lay there thinking..... man I dont 
want 
&gt; to get up right now I am soooo comfortable. Well lets just say I 
do 
&gt; that alot even tho I usually get up before the next alarm hits in 
a 
&gt; few minutes I still press it, roll over and lay there for a minute 
&gt; LOL. Some people hit the coffee machine.. i hit the snooze.
&gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt;   However, lately I am rolling over, but the body seems to stay 
&gt; still turned the other way. I used to do it often when I was a kid 
I 
&gt; would wake up in a totally different position than I thought I was 
&gt; laying in when I had my eyes closed. I&#x27;d think I was layin on my 
&gt; stomache and realize I was flat on my back or on my side. With 
&gt; gravity its pretty easy to feel which end is facing down and once 
I 
&gt; am fully alert its a little disorientating at first. I am curious 
if 
&gt; anybody else has that experience, including those who travel out 
of 
&gt; body at will.
