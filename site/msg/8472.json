Given in my opinion the boxes do open a portal due\n&gt; to the connection necessary for real time two way communication, and\n&gt; the wide spread belief that entities can and do manipulate physical\n&gt; objects when in the presence of them.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have just been made aware of a situation that has happened to a\n&gt; fairly new researcher whom I believe to be honest and forthcoming.\n&gt;\n&gt; the incident involved the aftermath of a regular RS box session. The\n&gt; researcher had finished his session with the practice of asking that\n&gt; any entities that may have traveled through the box, return and asked\n&gt; for conformation, then proceeded to end the session and turn the box\n&gt; off. he was assured that he turned the box off by going back to the\n&gt; recording after the incident and validating verbally that he did in\n&gt; fact turn off the box.\n&gt;\n&gt; He left the room for a few moments , when he returned he allegedly\n&gt; witnessed a white cloud move across the room and noticed that his RS\n&gt; box was turned on and running.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is actually the first instance I have encountered where the\n&gt; possibility of an entity that may have\n&gt;\n&gt; purposely stayed behind to turn the box back on and let other\n&gt; entities through. matter of fact\n&gt;\n&gt; that concept has not occurred to me before. but now sounds very\n&gt; possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; This may even happen at times we are never aware of and they actually\n&gt; turn the box on and when\n&gt; whatever comes through is through they turn it off again and we are\n&gt; none the wiser.\n&gt;\n&gt; I will definitely address this in my sessions, what I suggest is\n&gt; until we come to a mutual agreement among researchers\n&gt; on this occurrence, I think it best that when we end a session we\n&gt; remove at least one battery from the box to prevent it being turned\n&gt; back on.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nYou can' do ha wi h a minibox.
