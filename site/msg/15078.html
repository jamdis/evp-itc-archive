I'm not sure about the commercial stations.=A0I was more or less wondering =
if the BFO could sync with the beat frequencies to uncover some of the audi=
bles in between. Use it what is was made for, seperating the signal from th=
e carrier.

Frank,
What would be the theory behin=

I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an u=
ntrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It w=
orks off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that dif=
fer one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them together you =
get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sen=
ding a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an u=
ntrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference=
=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This=
 was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic sig=
nals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were =
generated within a few inches of the recorder.
=A0
We are able to reproduce=
 this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with a=
coustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce calle=
d the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
