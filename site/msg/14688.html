Hi All,
=A0
Is there som=
eone here that can answer and electrical question for me?
=A0
During the ca=
se that I recorded those possible EVP's-there was a loud tapping noise that=
 seemed to come from the 2nd bedroom. Upon checking my logs, every time one=
 of=A0 these clicks were heard, there would be an EMF spike in the livingro=
om. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livingroom downstairs. The home owners=
 have also reported that they have a touch lamp that comes on all the time =
by itself and the lights in the Kitchen will dim occasionally.
=A0
Now thes=
e taps are not consistent in timing, loudness or rhythm. Could this be the =
work of faulty breakers?
=A0
Thanks!
April
