There were numerous telephone calls made to\nMaggy Harsch-Fishbach, Mark Macy and even to Sarah Estep. These phone\ncalls were made by members of the group on the Other Side working with\nITC researchers during the 1990&#39;s. The group working with the ITC\nresearchers were guided by seven Ethereal beings on the Other Side\ncalled The Seven. Contact was not only made via telephone, but also\nfax and files placed in Maggy Fishbach&#39;s computer. :)\n\nI highly recommend Mr. Macy&#39;s book, Miracles In The Storm. He has much\nof this information on his website. http://worlditc.org\n\nMany Blessings All,\n\nJeremy Robert Huber\nNew York, New York\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; And were using Hacked Radios to talk to the dead!
