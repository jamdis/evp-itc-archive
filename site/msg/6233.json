That =\r\nis friendship \n  and sharing files and experiments and Ideas of how we can =\r\nbetter \n  ourselves for making contact with the other side and getting down=\r\n to \n  the Nitty Gritty without the negativity. That sounds like a song LOL=\r\n. \n  Well I myself respect everyone in this group I admire all your hard \n =\r\n work you guys do and the amount of time you put forth to try to \n  underst=\r\nand what all of this is leading to. Your efforts are \n  relentless. I mysel=\r\nf can only put forth alittle time of what I can \n  spare, because of my wor=\r\nk and my Wife ( who puts up with all this \n  managery ).

So all I can say is don&#39;t let negativity get this group=\r\n down and \n  just keep on doing what you all are here for people. What I he=\r\nar from \n  some of you is that the other side doesn&#39;t like discord or negat=\r\nivty \n  in this effort to communicate with them. This is just my thoughts a=\r\nnd \n  my feelings about it. Just throwing some Love your way to get \n  ever=\r\nybody back on track. I see your almost there.
