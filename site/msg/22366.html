<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I did a lot of experimentation with a digital still camera (Nikon D70s)
trying to fathom what might cause the &quot;orbs&quot; so many people come up with. I
got &quot;orbs&quot; in over half of the still photos I took in random places. Most
of them were places like farmer&#x27;s fields, shopping malls, country roads,
etc. Some were in places that are supposedly haunted. These places were not
free of dust, insects, etc. Some were in dry weather and some were taken
when it was drizzling or raining. I had to conclude that I could not verify
that any of them were paranormal in nature. Some of them may have been, but
based on what I found out, I could not say for sure. I did not see any
percentage change in the number or type of &quot;orbs&quot; that showed up in random
places and those that showed up in haunted places. Most of the &quot;orbs&quot;
showed up in flash photos. I also got lens flare in a lot of daytime photos.

I think the best way to capture &quot;orbs&quot; is with video. I have also spent
some time looking for things that may have been orbs on video. Usually I
have to say they were also dust blowing around, bits of leaves, insects,
etc. Rain or drizzle is pretty obvious. A single bright spot moving across
the screen at night could be dust or an insect. Large amounts of spots
moving in unison in a certain direction are for sure dust particles. I&#x27;ve
seen these move so fast that they were there in one fraction of a second
and gone the next.

I have seen a few things on video that I couldn&#x27;t be certain of as regular
explainable phenomena, though. In one case I saw a spot moving along, then
suddenly split into two spots which went off in two different directions.
That was definitely not dust or moisture. It could have been two insects
flying together which then separated. That&#x27;s the only possibility I could
think of other than something paranormal. That one was videotaped in a
basement that has a reputation of being haunted. I didn&#x27;t see any insects
at all in the basement while I was there.

There is one phenomenon I have not been able to explain. I have seen it
twice, both in places that were supposedly haunted (they were not in the
same place, though), both taken in total pitch black darkness at night.
They were both taken with digital cameras. And in both cases I was standing
right next to the person who took the photo and saw it on his camera&#x27;s
screen right after. They were both orange squiggly lines that zigzagged all
over the photo frame. I have never been able to reproduce this phenomenon
with my camera.

&gt; I saw a very good test done once on tv and it was shocking to me.  The
&gt; person had 2 cameras at a location, a 35mm and a digital.
&gt;
&gt; They took several pictures at the same time side by side, the digital had
&gt; several &quot;Orbs&quot; and the 35mm caught no anomaly&#x27;s at all in any of the
&gt; pictures.
&gt;
&gt; I believe what could be called an &quot;Orb&quot; for the most part can be debunked
&gt; quickly as dust, rain, bugs....etc
&gt;
&gt; At least 99 percent anyway.  I think we have more luck in the field using
&gt; different types of audio for evidence.
&gt;
&gt; Just my thoughts

&gt; One photo has multiple &quot;orbs&quot; - this indicates it is most likely dust
&gt; particle reflections. The other one, probably dust, too. Did you take
&gt; multiple photos from the exact same spot to compare?
