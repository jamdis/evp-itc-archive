Thanks Bruce. My wish is that we had unlimited posting/filing space. But til then we will have to make do with what we have. Try the esnips thing out several of us are already over there forming our lil community for file sharing. With 50 gigs you can pretty much post in whatever format you like which is what we do. Some files are just too large to post here or too many of them to post all at once so we just use that instead.
   
  Plus its easy to link up with others so that they get notifications you have uploaded a new file. I think for now its a great way to expand our group and possibly even reach more people who havent joined here or even heard of the things we do. It also keeps a hit count for how many people visit your folders so you can see what people are listening to. And it allows comments so that visitors can give feedback if they wish.

      Yep I agree with a few files there is some loss in conversion. Thats 
why I sent out that program because it has next to no loss in the 
conversion. But again I will say I would rather post 1 meg of files 
than take up the entire groups space by posting 15 megs of files. 
When I want to share more complete audio I just use my esnips.com 
account to do that. It is just as easy for people to click on my 
esnips hotlink in a notification post as it is to click on the files 
link to the left.

You are right we just have to manage ourselves better.

Wav. files or any other format. It seems like the Mp3's sound the

clear up 90 percent of the board right there. If i actually have more 
than a couple files from here on out, i will be attaching them to an 
e-mail and not the board to save space here. And also, if people do 
post files maybe we can all just have one post that says we have 
uploaded files to our folder instead of 30 audio announcements in a 
row that just seems to waste a lot of e-mail space in the individual 
e-mails. And it also pushes the current topic on the board to another 
page and is lost for those who wanted to share. Just my thoughts on 
helping the subject. I know we are all excited, but misty is right. I 
went to add a file the other day and the group was at 93 percent 
capacity, so it won't be long before we run out of space.-Steve H.---
