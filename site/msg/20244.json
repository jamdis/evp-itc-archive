Before my box sessions and recordings I always spend some time (a few minutes, at least) in meditation...nothing too involved or outrageous...just enough to get clear, become centered, grounded, focused, open, receptive and properly attuned to subtle beings and energies. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Once I&#39;ve entered a state of relaxed focused awareness (very similar to meditation or self hypnosis) I&#39;ll go ahead and connect with a higher energy field, my ancestors or the spirit world in general and begin the process of dowsing while posing my questions, mentally or aloud, to find the best possible combination of bands, scans, sweep rates, volume, distance and other factors which all contribute to great recordings and helpful, empowering, inspiring and positive exchanges with those in Spirit.\n&gt;  \n&gt; -J \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 1/11/11, mart &lt;littlegreys@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: mart &lt;littlegreys@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] AM VERSUS FM FOR EVP COMMUNICATION\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, January 11, 2011, 11:43 AM \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; Im wondering what most people use for evp reception\n&gt; Which do you work on most AM or FM for evp personally i prefer the fm band i find there is less radio interference and the voices seem to be clearer has anyone tried the short-wave frequencies\n&gt;"}
