The same one I use in the Mike&#39;s \nBox. I had a couple extras so I used it after recording some white \nnoise to its chip.\nThe microphone was one from a wear-on-the-head boom microphone.  I \ntook it apart and attached it inside the black box.\nI then placed some cotton over the top of it to help filter out the \nlouder audio of the white noise.\nThe box has a small hole in it cover with a rubber piece, so a bit of \naudio can come through from outside and be capture by the mic.\n\nWith the 8 foot cable, I can add and extension to that in case you \nwant to lower it into a well or something like that.  The box will \nkeep the microphone shelterd in a damp environment.\n\nYes, I&#39;ll be sure to stop by and meet you and April.  That would be \ngreat!\nI&#39;m waiting for Bill Murphy of the Darkness radio guys to contact me \nwith the specifics on me coming to the Stanley.  They wanted me to \ntalk and give the attendees a briefing on my prototype stuff, which I \nwould love to do.\nI go around from coast to coast giving briefings to people anyway for \nmy job, so I very much enjoy talking to crowds and find it very easy \nto do.\nThis would be my first paranormal group talk though.\n\nHave a great day!\n- Mike Coletta\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Allen&quot; &lt;amuck944@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike,\n&gt; \n&gt; I like the microphone.
