<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>People give power over themselves to who they choose. Whether it is a
leader, an entity, artifacts such voodoo dolls or even a grilled
cheese sandwich with a recognizable saint on it.

 Heck, movie character villains have even stated this. To quote
Candyman &quot;I live only because of the fear people have of me&quot;

&gt; &gt;  I definitely see the positive

&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I see the negative, but I balance it against the positive. This is  
&gt; called risk assessment, and we do it everyday for every action we  
&gt; take. To me, after neutral assessment of all the possibilities, both  
&gt; good and bad, and weighing of the evidence we do have from three to  
&gt; four decades of EVP and ITC, the rational conclusion appears to be  
&gt; that you take no more risk using a box then you do using a tape  
&gt; recorder. The box&#x27;s realtime talkback ability does not allow for  
&gt; extended messages-- they tend to be of the length of an EVP and  
&gt; sometimes fragment in the middle, just as EVP do. So  a person might  
&gt; hear &quot;You bastard,&quot; or such, but he is very unlikely to hear a long  
&gt; and spellbinding seduction to come to the Dark Side. The only  
&gt; difference between the box and EVP, from what I have listened to so  
&gt; far, is that it can be heard in realtime--there can be a quick and  
&gt; indisputable reply to a question. That doesn&#x27;t mean it can always be  
&gt; understood in realtime. I suspect box users are having to go back and  
&gt; re-listen to actually hear what was said.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, a neutral risk assessment shows clearly that one has a lot  
&gt; less chance of being harmed by a box than by benefiting by it.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I&#x27;m not afraid of these so-called dark entities. If I  
&gt; don&#x27;t let them, they can&#x27;t do a darned thing to me. Never have; never  
&gt; will. Worrying about them is a waste of time. Just approach the  
&gt; research with a positive attitude and &quot;the stomach of a lion,&quot; the  
&gt; quote Elizabeth I. And to quote another great leader, &quot;The only thing  
&gt; we have to fear is fear itself.&quot;
