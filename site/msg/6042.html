<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ralph, Welcome! You happened to walk in as the party was going full
bore but stick around, you&#x27;ll find most folks here really enjoy this
field and aren&#x27;t interesting in judging others. Of course not all here
are like that but for the most part it&#x27;s a fine forum to participate
in. -Bill

&gt; Hello all you EVP and ITC Buffs,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  Just putting my 2 cents in the mix so to speak. Hey I have posted 
&gt; some evp&#x27;s in Ralph&#x27;s Research Folder on here for your pleasure to 
&gt; listen to. I really don&#x27;t care if anyone thinks they are fake or miss 
&gt; identified sounds. All I care about is that to me they are real and I 
&gt; did my time working on them and I don&#x27;t have to prove to any Skeptics 
&gt; that what I have is evidence of the here after. You will never 
&gt; convince them and so why bother. All I know is what I got is enough 
&gt; evidence for me. You might believe it if you were here beside me at 
&gt; the time I am getting the evidence but we can&#x27;t all be in one place 
&gt; at the same time and no one can prove it otherwise to others who 
&gt; question their validity unless they were there. Myself I believe all 
&gt; of those that post their evidence on here are not trying to decieve 
&gt; people with fake evidence. They are just sharing their experience 
&gt; with what they consider evidence for themselves and to let all of us 
&gt; hear that evidence and compare notes. If we are all believers in this 
&gt; field and are true to ouselves and this forum why do we have to prove 
&gt; anything to others who question our methods as long as we are sharing 
&gt; our experinces and getting results that we are satisfied with, to the 
&gt; group on here. It&#x27;s nice to share our thoughts and methods and 
&gt; knowledge on this subject. Whatever method works for you and you get 
&gt; results who cares what others think as long as your happy with the 
&gt; finished results is all that matters. Can I ask what radio station 
&gt; says &quot; F--k Off &quot; on it and could that be just a snippet of some 
&gt; radio station that does not go by the rules of the FCC ? What radio 
&gt; station would say &quot; Hurry dead battery &quot; and then a few minutes later 
&gt; my batteries died ? You just can&#x27;t convince a skeptic. So I say let&#x27;s
&gt; have fun with our experiments and not squabble over SKEPTICS. Let&#x27;s 
&gt; enjoy the experience of sharing and not nit picking. I enjoy all the 
&gt; stuff people are presenting with all of their posts. It&#x27;s very 
&gt; interesting. Keep up the good work all of you that love this field.
&gt; I&#x27;m just a Postal worker. I&#x27;m no Rocket Scientist and not a 
&gt; professional by any means and I sure as heck am not an expert in this 
&gt; field, but I enjoy the friendship of those who love this exciting 
&gt; field such as all of you who are representing here. I thank you all 
&gt; for your comments whether good or bad on the postings I put on here.
&gt; We have been getting some great stuff on the EVP postings as I have 
&gt; heard, so keep it up and have a great time doing it. Well enough of 
&gt; that 2 cents. If you have any questions on my EVPs just give me a 
&gt; holler. Peace to everyone and keep that info flowing. Knowldege is a 
&gt; terrible thing to waste LOL.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Ralph the Ghost Hunter
