Communication with something be=\r\nyond yourself is a personal endeavor. Stephen Rorke makes his living on hoa=\r\nx news and to him this is news. I can&#39;t blame anyone for questioning the re=\r\nality around them. But I can take a look at what else a person has had to c=\r\nontribute to the world and the feild of study they claim to be in.  I sugge=\r\nst you all do the same before you take someones ideas and make them your ow=\r\nn. He has a right to form his own opinion, experiment and get his own resul=\r\nts, and believe whatever he wishes. But so do I.\n\n        Based on my own e=\r\nxperiments, my own results, my own experiences, I form MY own opinions and =\r\nbeliefs. As for the spiricom communication device all I can say is its inte=\r\nresting but I was not there, I did not experiement with it, I have no resul=\r\nts with which to base an opinion on. All we have left is some recorded data=\r\n, and heresay.\n\n        As for Frank&#39;s box and Sweep Tuning I can say I hav=\r\ne seen the results, I have experimented with ST myself and I have received =\r\nsome astounding results which are message communications that are outside o=\r\nf my own knowledge and my own ability to control or create. I have used man=\r\ny methods for EVP and ITC and have had many interesting results that have b=\r\neen confirmed, recognized, and proved beyond a shadow of MY own doubt. This=\r\n is MY personal experience and I invite anyone who wishes to know more to t=\r\nry it for themselves and get their own results rather than waste time tryin=\r\ng to pick apart others ideas, theories or results. I never try and prove an=\r\nything to anyone else because for each of us it takes that one very persona=\r\nl experience to have that eye opening moment and realize that there is more=\r\n around us than what is apparent.\n\n        So no I am not offended by anyth=\r\ning anyone has to say as long as they base thier statements on truth rather=\r\n than BS. And we all know there are alot of people who make their life revo=\r\nlve around the BS as well as try to profit from it.\n\n        My best advice=\r\n would be to try it in depth before you form an opinion. Your results may d=\r\niffer from others, your personal experience may not be the same but that is=\r\n YOUR experience, not mine, to explore further.\n\n        My journey has bee=\r\nn quite fascinating, educational, and enlightening. I could only hope that =\r\neveryone else has a similar path, but we each have our own roads to travel.=\r\n\n\n        Misty\n\n\n        --- On Sat, 9/26/09, purplespacefriend &lt;purpleali=\r\nengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          From: purplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengi=\r\nrl@...&gt;\n          Subject: [EVP-ITC] Anyone else offended by C2C?\n   =\r\n       To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n          Date: Saturday, September 26, =\r\n2009, 8:29 PM\n\n\n            \n          Art Bell was filling in, and he had =\r\na guest that supposedly worked with Spiricom.
