Maybe Aprils right I dont know until I ask.

They told him negative, and he told me the little boy\n&gt;&gt; who was the worst off was still alive. I asked him why did you ask them if\n&gt;&gt; it was a 7. He said code 7, I was asking them if they were dead. So if you\n&gt;&gt; ever hear anyone call 7 over the radio that means someones dead.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Just thought I would pass that on.
