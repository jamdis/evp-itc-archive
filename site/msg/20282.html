Hello CB,

Its my=
 wife who gets the dolls, originally she bought a few from ebay. She's a se=
nsitive and I do all the metaphysical stuff so between us we tune in and se=
e what we get thats how we buy them..

Most people can tune in and sense so=
mething it just takes practise. The human instrument is the most sensitive =
instrument for spirits but the challenge is to remove yourself from that gr=
eat noise generator - the brain and learn to listen with your intuition. Ta=
kes practise but just try it..

Over time we've helped other people who've =
had problems with dolls and she and her site have become very well known an=
d people have donated dolls etc so we have a house full of them. Its primar=
ily her interest Im just recruited to read them or channel and she also use=
s electronic means for that like convnetional EVP but I've decided to build=
 something in the ITC mode to give her that facility too as she's very inte=
rested..

Ebay nowadays is full of absolute junk so we would always immedia=
tely dismiss anything that says "very haunted doll guaranteed the best ever=
" and all that nonsense.. I know that for this reason she's considered offe=
ring her site for the sale of dolls that we know are genuine and perhaps ac=
t as at least some vetting of whats genuine and what isnt. She also sometim=
es sells the odd one thats been donated to her and gives the money to an an=
imal charity..

You can always email her and ask her directly and sometimes=
 she'll offer you her opinion on ones advertized on ebay and tell you who t=
he best sellers are as she knows the good ones.. http://haunteddolls.net
