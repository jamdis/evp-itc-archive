&gt; Chris was the first and only person testing this device for quite
sometime, making him the &quot;primary tester&quot;. The dictionary defines the
word&quot;primary&quot; as being or standing first in a list. You offer that he
wasalso the first to understand how it was supposed to be used. Yet,
nowas more and more people weigh in with their own opinions you
questionyour initial judgment. The fact is that Chris&#x27; opinion of how
the boxshould be used has never changed. He has held steadfast to
hisbeliefs. That, my friend, is an honorable trait in this field and
afact that should be considered. Chris has also never claimed this
technology to be his own. He hasalways and will always give credit
where credit is due. He does thisboth publicly and privately. The use
of syntax here on whether we call it Frank&#x27;s Box, TheTelephone to the
Dead, Maxi/Mini Box, or Granola in a can is of noimportance. Truly,
because Edison&#x27;s plans were never discovered thereis no way to know
for sure whether or not your plans are exactly whatEdison was working
on. There also seems to be a bit of confusion on the role
the&quot;technicians&quot; play in this along with another syntax issue ( could
thewords network and technician be used interchangeably?).
Thetechnicians are not interpreters. They can provide assistance to
thosespirits too excited or otherwise unable to communicate
effectively.And they, the technicians, also serve to assist higher
vibrations comethrough (just as your &quot;network&quot;). They can also be of
benefit whenlower vibrations try to get through. You state you heard a
voice say &quot;Edison here&quot; and awhile back you hadposted that you did
believe it to in fact be Edison himself. Yet nowyou say the &quot;supposed&quot;
Edison conversation. As for portals... I&#x27;ve made my concerns clear
previously known.However, I have witnessed the box being used in one
location only tohave activity spike in another. I&#x27;ve also heard many
other storiesrelated to dark or lower entities. So, perhaps you have
had noexperiences yet but, others have and they are speaking up. You
repeatedly state that Chris is a good guy but then you say &quot;if hecan&#x27;t
use it in an honest manner...&quot; What could be more honest thansomeone
sticking to the same beliefs he&#x27;s held since day one? Whatcould be
more honorable than stating his fears and providing what hefeels is a
needed warning? Frank, isn&#x27;t it possible that you two both bring
something separate tothis device? You, the technology and science
said. Chris, the mediumand spiritual side. Someone posted separately
here about Chris&#x27; ego. I can say this...having concern for the
possible negative fall out to unsuspectingpeople is in no way ego
ridden. To assume that you know Chris&#x27;intentions is full of ego. To
claim that he only wants to preventothers from having a device for
selfish reasons, is ego&#x27;s way oftelling you that you and everyone else
&quot;deserves&quot; to have what we donot fully understand. Ego won&#x27;t let you
consider that because &quot;youwant what you want when you want it&quot;.BTW-
when the word &quot;harmony&quot; is referred to here it is not a
&quot;feelinginside&quot; like self esteem or some other warm fuzzy. It is
aboutresonance, vibrations, that which will be matched by like
resonanceand vibrations. Harmony. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,
Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; I did, from the begining
open this to anyone, and I am not amusedthat one person would take the
technogoly, claim it as his own, andattempt to make it exclusive to
himself. For one person to say he isthe &quot;primary tester&quot; is
inaccurate, he was the first that kindaunderstood how it was supposed
to be used, or so I thought. I think weleft the &quot;treting phase&quot; some
time ago, perhaps it&#x27;s time to returnbarrowed equipment?&gt; &gt; I wasn&#x27;t
quite finished with that e-mail-- I hit the send button inmy rush to
get off to work. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I put out a box use guideline thing a year or
two ago stating thatno one has the right to take my equipment and and
claim their usesupercedes anyones else&#x27;s use, or results.&gt; &gt; So, to
contiue...&gt; &gt; As a far as &quot;technicians&quot; I don&#x27;t get any of that stuff,
but---theydo talk about a network, and connection to our equipment.
When I firstmade my &quot;Ghostman&quot; box, last week, it wasn&#x27;t working well,
but a dayor so later, it came to life, and one of the voices said it
had beenconnected to &quot;the network&quot;. Supposedly there is a similar
connectionmade to computers running EVPmaker. I&#x27;m not sure if these
&quot;network&quot;connections are maintained if equipment is taken out
forinvestigations, or demostrations. Of cousre, I can&#x27;t say if
thesenetworks are a fact. I would think as maker of the box, these
etherictechs might want to give me, or others some hints.&gt; &gt; As far as
the ghost box, or Frank&#x27;s box, being a &quot;telephone to thedead&quot;, I think
is very poor analogy, the old style phone system ofEdison&#x27;s day had
operators, plural, not one person that recieved allcalls, then
interpreted what was being said to other parties. That&#x27;smore of a
master control schema.The old phone system didn&#x27;t charge youan arm and
a leg to talk to someone in the same room either! Somemight say these
&quot;Technicains&quot; are the operators, but even if anyoneesle could hear
these voices, why do you need someone to interpretwhat&#x27;s being said. I
say if not many can hear it, or somethingsimilar, it ain&#x27;t real! There
is a certain kind of conatct, ion thatthat your own mind uses the
noise as a sort of psychic prop, you hearthe stuff in your head, it
may be accurate and real inforamntiion, butno one else is going to
hear it. i think that what all this supposedconverstions wiht Edison
maybe. I have in fact heard a voice thatsaid &quot;Edison here&quot; but there
was no other real information conveyedthat I could understand. &gt; As
for portals, demons and evil spirits entering the world throughthese
&quot;unauthorized&quot; boxes, I an only say, as the original mker of thebox, I
have gotten voices cuzzing, swearing, name calling, and
eventhreatening, but nothing that has seemingly &quot;entered&quot; our world.
Eventhose &quot;threatening entities&quot;, when pressed to bring it, fold up
likepaper tigers. These beings and spirits already exist all around
us,and at a higher level, so they have full access to this, a
lowerlever. Besides. There is that &quot;network&quot; that seem to allow for
bettercontacts, and kinda helps highter being to come through. &gt; &gt; I
made these &quot;boxes&quot;! The idea was not &quot;Edisons Telephone...&quot; WhatI got
was an assemblage of my own expereince and knowlegde, puttogether by
my own mind as answer to my question of what else could Iuse for
spirit comuncation. All technology involved was based on whatI had
worked on in the past for radio experimentation. I had in fact,a
couple years before my interest in EVP, been experimenting withvoltage
tunable radio modules removed from car stereos for AM DX,that&#x27;s
listening to distant AM radio stations. I was hoping to findother talk
shows similar to Art Bell, and there used to be one out
ofCincinati(?). The idea of using a random voltage to tune the radio
wasafter using EVPmaker, which uses a method of generating random
speechbits for the entities to use. It was a small leap to apply the
randomtechnique to an anolog system. I am not the first to be focusing
on aproblem, and have the mind provide an solution in complete
form.Nothing mystical about it. The fact is, after much work,
andexperimenting, the tuning doesn&#x27;t have to be random, a linear
tuningworks much better. Yet another fact of the box, covienently
ignored.&gt; &gt; What really chaps my hide, as maker of the box, is to have
someone,who knows nothing of electronics, and technology completely
ignoreeverything I say about the box, and presume to tell me how it
reallyworks, how it should be used, and what is acceptable from it.
This guyis so honest, he won&#x27;t even use his real name, but huff and
puff at atanyone that contradicts his use of my equipment. I say, as
&quot;a Tester&quot;if you can&#x27;t use it in an honest manor, bring the stuff
back--testingover! Like it or not, the public has this technology, you
can keeppissing and moaning, trying to spread fear, or you could
choose theway of Light. &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
