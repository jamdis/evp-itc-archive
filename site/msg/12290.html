<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>For me personally I dont use the allophones tho some like it. As far as settings go that usually differs depending on the raw audio I am using. I pretty much just ask they tell me what settings to use, numbers, what to turn on or turn off etc. Then rerun the test under the new settings they suggested. 

Ive tried many types of raw audio including the tones, allophones, music, chatter, babble, and some I made specifically for the purpose. It wasnt something I liked right away, but over time as the contact field grew stronger so did the intensity of the messages. That speaks for all methods I have tried. What works for me doesnt always work for someone else but if you have the dedication and your hearts in the right place then you are off to a good start.
