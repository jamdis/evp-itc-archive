<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>For me, the Spirit Box prototype many times acts differently when I 
get it out of my house and at certain purportedly haunted locations.  
Two places I experimented with it at were very active, and the number 
of messages I received at each place were astounding to me (over 20 
from each location).  A not-so active place gleaned only 4-6 messages 
(I don&#x27;t really keep the &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; &quot;hi,&quot; etc short, one-word 
messages too often as evidence).  

I am pretty pleased with the results of the prototype, though I was 
told by some it wouldn&#x27;t work the way we had built it and almost 
scrapped it (I formerly hated the FM band as well).

&gt;  Thanks! Well, that&#x27;s the main thing, I don&#x27;t do investigations, I 
do 
&gt; all my recordings from the basement, at home. Even at Stanely, I 
was 
&gt; present at &quot;investigations&quot; but everyone else asked thew questions, 
&gt; iI just kinda stood by.

&gt; &gt; Frank, I understand where you are coming from, as I often get 
&gt; &gt; frustrated when I hear myself or another asking a question and 
&gt; there 
&gt; &gt; is an answer within the same audio from the spirits.  So I agree 
&gt; with 
&gt; &gt; this.  I only hear about 10% of the answers live, and find re-
&gt; &gt; listening to the recording at least two times is beneficial to 
&gt; catch 
&gt; &gt; everything.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; However, we were at a lighthouse that was supposed to be haunted, 
&gt; and 
&gt; &gt; a lady asked if there was a &quot;Captain Babcock&quot; with us.  About 8 
&gt; &gt; seconds later, the reply, &quot;Spirit of Babcock&quot; came through 
&gt; clearly.  
&gt; &gt; The file is in my folder here.  So I do see value as well in 
asking 
&gt; &gt; questions.  The downside is we have a tendency to talk over them 
&gt; &gt; sometimes, yet, it is nice to provide the earthbounds direction 
to 
&gt; &gt; help them speak what we need to hear (to help them).  If people 
&gt; think 
&gt; &gt; they do not need help, then they haven&#x27;t been doing this enough 
in 
&gt; &gt; places where people in spirit are in trauma.  Believe me, some of 
&gt; &gt; them truly are and are in need of help - period.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Perhaps there are two ways to do this, depending on what one is 
&gt; &gt; trying to accomplish.  At a haunted location, I seem to hear 
&gt; &gt; enlightened spirits, as well as earthbounds coming through.  This 
&gt; &gt; type of situation can be especially helpful to ask questions in 
my 
&gt; &gt; experience, as it helps to ferret out what&#x27;s going on there and 
&gt; &gt; provide &quot;evidence&quot; of intelligent responses to the questions.  
This 
&gt; &gt; worked well to prove the spirit box as legit to the group who 
&gt; &gt; accompanied me.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; When just trying to get &quot;higher&quot; messages from spirits, etc at 
home 
&gt; &gt; or elsewhere, I do think just letting it run and record is a 
great 
&gt; &gt; way to work with it, too.  This way, there are no expectations, 
&gt; just 
&gt; &gt; taking the time to listen for direction, messages of truth, 
hellos, 
&gt; &gt; etc.  Sometimes this way will really surprise you, especially 
when 
&gt; &gt; something comes through &quot;off the cuff&quot; and you are not expecting 
&gt; it.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Frank, I hear your advice captain, but also want to throw in some 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; my personal experiences into the discussion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi All;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  This is why I say don&#x27;t get so tied up asking questions and 
&gt; trying 
&gt; &gt; to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; get that one profound answer while missing all the real stuff. 
In 
&gt; &gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; file I have in my folder of the 30 second test of #36, the very 
&gt; &gt; first 
&gt; &gt; &gt; voice is &quot;Thomas Edison(sung)--I Never Visited Frank&quot;, I did 
not 
&gt; &gt; hear 
&gt; &gt; &gt; this until the third time I listened to the entire session. I&#x27;m 
&gt; not 
&gt; &gt; so 
&gt; &gt; &gt; intent on runing session after session all friggin&#x27; day that I 
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; &gt; have/take time to listen. If I was trying to hear this stuff 
&gt; &gt; direct, I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; would miss it, and simialr voices about 99% of the time. That&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; why, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; forget the damn questions, and just listen--over and over till 
&gt; you 
&gt; &gt; &gt; think you&#x27;ve gotten it all. Even my dad, and son come through 
in 
&gt; &gt; their 
&gt; &gt; &gt; own time, I don&#x27;t costantly ask for them. I swear to God, they 
&gt; know 
&gt; &gt; who 
&gt; &gt; &gt; is listening, when you are listening/recording, and what you 
need 
&gt; &gt; to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; know! Trust it!
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  I know, the idiot scientist type will insist you have to ask 
&gt; &gt; &gt; questions, and confirm the answers, but that is BS, and results 
&gt; &gt; little 
&gt; &gt; &gt; useful information. Useful, as in has personal signifgance.
