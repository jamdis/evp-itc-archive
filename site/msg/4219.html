&gt; You really need to look at this from a different perspective. We 
need to get away from the erroneous concept of duality. Instead of 
polarizing factions like good and evil or light and dark, there is 
only shades of gray. There are no two terminal ends of the scale as 
we picture it. The fact is there is only the scale, which slides to 
infinity in all directions and is defined by vibration and density. 
Positive and negative ideals and attitudes determine where on the 
scale you fit and what entities of like characteristics fits with 
you. These are comfort zones!
&gt; 
&gt; As human beings we have a tendency to judge things in terms of 
ultimates. It seems we can only understand concepts if they have a 
ultimate, clearly defined top or bottom. These concepts have always 
served us well here on Earth. They have allowed us to define our 
reality where most everyone can understand it in one capacity or 
another. In the reality outside of our bubble, the greater reality if 
you will there are no ultimates or ends.
