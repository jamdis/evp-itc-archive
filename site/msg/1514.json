The \nspirits were so nasty and evil all they did was curse and threaten my \nfriend&#39;s boyfriend Ed.  This is the first time i&#39;ve experienced the \nevil side of the box, i usually get &quot;hi&quot; and nice gestures like that.  \nI did help them resolve who was there though.  I got specific names \nand why they were haunting the place and also got some background info \nfrom them after the session with the box.  I also had EMF spikes off \nthe charts.  I got 2 than 6 than .1 and back to 4.  Really active \nhouse, but i hope i helped with the box.  Everyone was able to \nunderstand the box and communictate with me to them.  Awesome session \nand i&#39;m looking forward to the future of new boxes.\n\nThanx everyone for your support\n-Steve H."}
