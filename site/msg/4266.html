<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi LC,

The mic is a &quot;ListenUp&quot; brand.  I got it at Radio Shack.  They had 
their own brand there too, but theirs was about $12 more.  I think 
they just started carrying the &quot;ListenUp&quot; brand.  I like the blue 
light effect too...
The earbuds came with the mic, but they are not amplifeid, just the 
mic is.

&gt; Mike, one more question for you:
&gt; 
&gt; What&#x27;s the brand of amplified mic you are using and does Radio 
SHack 
&gt; have it, too?  It seems to be a bit better than the amplified lapel 
&gt; mic I am using inside my echo chamber.  I am experimenting with two 
&gt; mics, as when I added the splitter I couldn&#x27;t get any audio out of 
it 
&gt; like you do.  It must either be the mic you are using is better, or 
&gt; the headphones/earbuds you use are amplified (??).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; LC

&gt; &gt; I have produced another video, this one of my completed portable 
&gt; Ghost 
&gt; &gt; Box System (Mike&#x27;s Box 12.470)
&gt; &gt; This video, in three parts on YouTube walks you through how the 
&gt; chamber 
&gt; &gt; system works, while describing the components and going through 
the 
&gt; &gt; description of how to control the devices with the chamber closed.
