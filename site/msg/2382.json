I guess I was thinking more along the\nlines of recording directly into Adobe rather than broadcasting on the\nweb.\n\nBabs\nwww.thepsinetwork.com \n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  Yeah, there was some discussion and work toward boradcasting live\nstreaming audio from the box onto the web, but all involved got kinda\nsidetracked with other projects, but it hasn&#39;t been forgotten. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  The box is basically a swept radio tuner. Someone good at\nprogramming could create a program to tune a radio on a plug in card,\nmaking it sweep the tuning. You could do the same thing with a TV\ntuenr on a computer card and get video images, as I&#39;ve done with my\nanalog system.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  BTW, there is already a program which was the inspiration of the\nboxes, it&#39;s called EVPmaker, and it&#39;s freeware. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: babiarz3@...: Mon, 8 Oct 2007 20:33:39\n+0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Wi-Fi?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hey folks, been reading for a long time and am finally posting. I\nhavea question in regards to a dream a friend had...The dream was\nvague but in it a woman in her low to mid 30&#39;s istalking about her\nfather who has figured out a way to run Frank&#39;s Boxthrough a laptop.\nEnd of dream. When the dream was relayed to me, mygut response was\n&quot;Oh! They are using the wi-fi antennae&quot;. Now, don&#39;tget me wrong. I&#39;m\nabout as technical as a shoe string but the dreamcame across as a\nstrong message. Is this even possible? The only real &quot;visual&quot; of the\ndream was as the voices are comingthrough, they are showing up on the\nlaptop as well... as if AdobeAudition or some other sound editing\nprogram is being used inconjunction.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Boo!
