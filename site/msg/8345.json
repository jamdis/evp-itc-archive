Have you ever tried to use ceramic capacitors instead?\nPerhaps the elcos have a tiny leakage current which are amplified by the\nopamps until the output gets overloaded. - Just a thought...\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n\n&gt;  Oh yeah, btw, I did get the sockets in I was waiting for, that&#39;s why the work on the RNG part of the Speakjet board.   I think I&#39;ve always had this weird mis-match problem with the white noise\n&gt; circuit, but going from op amp stage to op amp stage as in the RVG, it&#39;s not as apparent. There could be a number of factors, maybe just changing the op amp type would solve the problem(?) I was\n&gt; seeking a more universal solution with the addition of the buffer stage, so it won&#39;t matter so much which op amp is used.  \n \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; In a rush?
