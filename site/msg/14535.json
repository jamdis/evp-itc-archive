Dr. Sam El-Khazen recently published an article in the\n Journal of Neuroquantology (study of brain function at the quantum\n mechanical level). In this paper entitled &quot;DNA The Gateway to\n Time&quot;, El-Khazen talks about the relationship between the structure\n of DNA, time, conscious perception and gravity. There is credible\n evidence that these are intimately correlated. \n\nAn important finding for this group has to do with how we may in\n fact detect external influences in the physical world. If El-Khazen\n has it right, two EM waves must align in order for the preception\n process to even begin. If this does not happen, there is nothing to\n perceive, even though we may be impacted by an external potentially\n influencing EM wave. The second wave is generated from borrowed\n energy within our brain cells and is modelled upon the structure of\n DNA strands. So yes we are impacted by billions of EM signals per\n second but we actually detect only a small portion of these that we\n later process in the late-stage perceptual processes. \n\nThis would nicely explain why two people would perceive events\n differently despite the fact that they were literally side by side\n witnessing the same event. Again this is strictly a matter of\n random probability, it seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with\n volition or intention. That is more the focus of the later\n perceptual processing which is in turn dependent upon this\n probabilistic process.\n\nThis could also explain why it is that EVP and ITC signals are\n perceived differently by different people even when no physical\n alteration to the media has occurred and why different things are\n heard more easily at different times by the same person."}
