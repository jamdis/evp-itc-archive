I wanted to try it again today with an actual session. These files are fro=
m a short 5 minute recording. They seem very conversational with this box.

Not much radio coming through, mostly fragments of speech making up the co=
mmunication. That's how i like it anyway. 

I never use words from the radi=
o, that is NOT communication in my opinion. If you train your ear to listen=
 a little differently, you will hear them talking using bits and pieces of =
sounds and not actual radio words.

My files are never crystal clear, but i=
t is in my opinion an authentic way to present what we do. Fragmented words=
 seperated by a fast sweep that you can clearly hear, that's how we will wi=
n against the skeptics.
