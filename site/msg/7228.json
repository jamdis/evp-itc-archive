Another Box ???", "author": "Regan", "timestamp": "2008-02-17T20:23:00Z", "full_text": "Yes yes, like my husband and counterpart said, it&#39;s just a radio shack \nhack. It&#39;s new to us, and new to our state. (As far as we know). So \nit&#39;s pretty big for us. We had a chance to use it, and the minibox that \nRob from Deadscience has, last night at the Seattle Museum of \nMysteries. Pretty interesting. We worked it, discussed it, and batted \naround ideas of adaption, or improvments, that could possibly be made. \nIt&#39;s not a &quot;new box&quot; .. .just new to us. It&#39;s like a teenager with \na &quot;new used&quot; car. LOL.\n\nThank you guys so much for being here, answering questions and being so \nopen and helpful. It helps us out when we have questions. Good luck to \nall of you!! \n\nSincerely\nRegan\nAPART of WA"}
