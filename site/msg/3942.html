<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Good Evening!

I&#x27;ve been very busy today going through a long, intense audio 
recording taken at the Gainesville, Texas house, which my team 
investigated on Sunday, November 25th.

All of the EVPs I just posted were gathered in the unoccupied 
upstairs bedroom. Only three investigators were present in the room. 
Their voices have been properly taken into account and ruled out as 
sources of the actual EVPs. 

The new and resampled EVPs have been saved as .mp3 files. They can be 
freely downloaded from the site here -

You will hear quite a few odd words, dog barks, and even mimicry. 
Some of the voices are faint and whispery. Other EVP voices sound 
like the invisibles are standing right along side the researchers!

Sexual Content Warning:

Several of the EVPs have strong sexual content. 

Please read the file name prior to downloading.

Listening to the EVPs will be at your own disgression.

That stated, those that choose to listen to the EVPs, please let me 
know if any of them need further contextual clarification. I look 
forward to hearing feedback. As it stands, the true nature of what&#x27;s 
going on in the house awaits much more serious attention. 

Sincerely,
Lance Oliver, Founder
Denton Area Paranormal Society</pre>
