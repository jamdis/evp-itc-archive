Well done!\n\nBarb\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tim&quot; &lt;tjwoolwo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Annie / Jay,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sorry to hear that you have to go through this.  \n&gt; \n&gt; How long after you moved into this place did the events in question begin occurring?  Did they begin after a traumatic event?  Or after a previously used object was brought in to the house?  Have you dabbled with opening portals via ritual or device recently?  Have you asked anything to manifest itself to you?\n&gt; \n&gt; What it sounds like you have is an intelligent entity that is responding to you.  The more sound it makes, the more you notice it.  Someone is trying to get your attention, and it does not appear to be  negative by the way you describe it (no one is getting hurt, things are not breaking).\n&gt; \n&gt; So therefore, the question is why are they trying to get your attention?  My first guess is that because you have intimated that you ad your partners are sensitives; this may be why this being is drawn to you.  It may feel that you can understand it better than most and therefore help it.\n&gt; \n&gt; You have mentioned that you have done rituals.  I am assuming that one of those rituals is a cleansing.  A cleansing typically works with an intelligent entity if it is done properly.  In cases like this, the most important thing to know is that you can never tell an entity to leave.  If it is intelligent, it will leave on its own accord.  \n&gt; \n&gt; In my experience, I have found that most of the time, the entity is &quot;stuck&quot; here.  They passed on, but missed the light.  From EVP&#39;s and Box sessions, I have found that most of these entities stuck are afraid of eternal judgement so they avoided the light.  This creates a world for them which grows more and more hopeless as time passes on, a sort of &quot;limbo&quot; if you will.  The more hopeless they get, the more angrier they become.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you do a cleansing properly, the entity should be able to leave:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1). Open all your windows and doors.\n&gt; 2). Use only a fresh sage smudge stick (pick it yourself or buy them from a farmer on eBay).  When burning sage, carry a metal bowl around to catch the ash and a grill lighter (fresh sage wants to go out a lot at first, try to keep it lit before it burns out).  If you set the sage on glass, it will break from the heat and plastic will melt.\n&gt; 3). Buy a blessed salt mixture from your local esoteric shop.  If you don&#39;t have one nearby, send me an email and I&#39;ll ship you a bag.\n&gt; 4). Protect yourself and focus in on the energy of the house.  If you are sensitive you should be able to tell if it is male or female and that is a great start.  \n&gt; 5). Begin in the basement of the house and proceed through every\n&gt; room of the house while leaving the most active room of the house for last.  Before you leave each room, sprinkle the salt at the opening of any window or door to bind it.\n&gt; 6).  Most importantly, take your house back but be nice.  Address the entity directly compassionately and begin a one sided conversation with it.  Tell him or her that it needs to cross over, that there is nothing but peace on the other side, that friends and loved ones are waiting, and that there is nothing to fear and to not be afraid.  It is a place of no judgement but of pure understanding and love, and that it is the natural progression of life and there physical time on earth is done for now.  Let it know that the house is no longer there&#39;s and that you do not desire it&#39;s presence in you life any longer.  This is very important: invite it to let your spirit guides show it the way to the light.  Let it know that once it crosses over, it can come back to check on loved ones, but it needs to cross over first to learn the way.  Keep saying these things politely and confidently.\n&gt; 7).  Chances are when you reach the last room, your entity will have holed itself in there and this is where you need to be at your strongest and most confident.  If you feel it in there with you, have a heart to heart with it and say these things.  Tell it how it is disrupting your family and all the things about crossing over.  Also be clear about whether or not you will allow it to come back and visit you after it has crossed; if you feel good about the process I would invite it back if it will be peaceful (this makes you seem less forceful).\n&gt; \n&gt; You should feel an energy lift if it happens.  Let your house air out and then say a binding prayer before closing each window and door.  do not snuff out the sage, bring it outside and let it burn its way out.  Some people recommend binding the perimeter of the house with salt but this should not be necessary.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have done this many times and it works most of the time.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck, \n&gt; TJ\n&gt; \n&gt;"}
