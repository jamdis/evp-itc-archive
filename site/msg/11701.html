<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That seems like an awful lot of extra added crap to me. I&#x27;m more of a
keep it simple kinda gal. To me the more stuff you add the less likely
your results aren&#x27;t tainted somehow. I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m even kinda iffy
about introducing the radio to what I do. Maybe that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t get
conversations on it. haha Oh well.

I&#x27;m better with a camera than I am with all this voice stuff.

&gt; He has 3 radios running through a mixer, plus a mic. White/pink noise mixes

&gt; LOL, not as far as I know, but then I&#x27;m the one asking because I&#x27;m not
&gt; getting any results so what do I know?
&gt;
&gt; It generates a bunch of noise on it&#x27;s own so I wouldn&#x27;t think any more
&gt; would be necessary. It was my understanding that the messages come
&gt; through &quot;whomever&quot; manipulating the radio voices as it rapidly goes
&gt; from station to station. I&#x27;m just recording what comes through the
&gt; radio.
&gt;
&gt; Am I leaving out some important step?
