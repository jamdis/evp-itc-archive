<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I did a DRV session last night and I just wanted to share some of the 
results with the group. They came thru quite clearly even tho they had 
some difficulty making the link to where I was tuned off station in 
the &quot;dead&quot; zone. I usually start and end my sweep sessions off station 
but they had been coming thru quite clear there so last night I did the 
entire session that way. As always Tony was there to lend a hand.

For those who have any difficulty playing the files try downloading 
then playing.
