I have some EVP of a woman talking to my dog.  One time when I \nwas recording, my dog (Kindred) started barking.  When I listened back to the session (this \nwas tradition EVP done in silence with a digital recorder) she had said, &quot;Kindred.  What was \nthat?&quot;  \n\nIn another, Kindred barks, then the woman says, &quot;Kindred.  She thinks you&#39;re sleeping.&quot;  I \nalso have one of someone telling her &quot;NO&quot; and I really like the one where someone tattles \non her to me, &quot;Kindred&#39;s headed for the dumpster.&quot;  LOL.  Just goes to show you they are \nnot only keeping an eye on us, but the animals too.  I think it&#39;s great that sometimes they \nare talking directly to the dog.  \n\nI only have one involving my cat, Kizmyt, where someone says, &quot;Stay back&quot; (the cat had \ncome into the room as I was recording).\n\nI have gotten many ITC images of animals, so clearly they are an important part of the \nspirit realm.  :-)  As well, I had animals come through during sitting with a medium.\n\nThanks for sharing about your Molly EVP!  It made me smile.\n\nMargaret  \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jeremy Robert Huber&quot; &lt;JeremyRobertHuber@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Again Margaret,\n&gt; \n&gt; I forgot to tell you this earlier. Since you are also a dog owner I\n&gt; know you will appreciate this.\n&gt; \n&gt; The day before yesterday I received an EVP. Male Voice.\n&gt; \n&gt; He takes what sounds like a breath and says...Pooch. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I, of course always have Molly, my Jack Russell Terrier by my side\n&gt; when I record.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, I guess I have a Spirit Friend that loves animals too. \n&gt; \n&gt; Grin.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many Blessings All,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt; New York, New York\n&gt;"}
