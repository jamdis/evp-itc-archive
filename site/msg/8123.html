<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I saw the show, Debbie; very interesting captures by you and your 
group at Eastern State!  I was there last May, in the morning just 
when it opened; there was no one else around and I heard 
unexplainable footsteps walking above me in Cell Block 4 and, upon 
investigation, discovered there was no one up there.  I also picked 
up what may be an EVP - &quot;Hi&quot; - at Al Capone&#x27;s cell and definitely 
feel that the soft music that was playing in his cell may have 
contributed the necessary bits of raw audio for that to come through.

Please keep us posted on your upcoming shows; I saw the first one, 
too, and enjoyed it very much, despite Maury&#x27;s exaggerated 
personality.
