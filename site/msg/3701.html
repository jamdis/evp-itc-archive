 My only advice, use it from the same location, at least for a couple days=
. There seesm to be something they cannect to it. My version of the nMini b=
ox wasn't working well froa a couple days, then al the suddenn started work=
ing. the radio was scanning, and the electronics was working, just the "voi=
ces" were weak. 
 
 but...what do I know?
