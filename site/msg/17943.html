If you want to post a prediction, post one.=C2=A0 Give specific dates and d=
etails.=C2=A0 Try not to make it for something that is already all over the=
 news and whose outcome is already pretty obvious.

You keep saying you don=
't need to prove this stuff, then you keep trying to post proof.=C2=A0 Just=
 giving more stories from the past does not prove anything.=C2=A0 No one ca=
n confirm the story: and I'll bet, even though you claim to have gone to th=
e police with it, you will not be able to even produce the police report.=
=C2=A0 And I'll bet there was not one mention in a newspaper that the case =
was solved by EVPs.=C2=A0 Must be a conspiracy :)

We can also not confirm =
that the stuff you are telling the police wasn't already all over the news:=
 which is how I've noticed many EVP interpretations seems operate: you hear=
 what is already on your mind.

So if you have a prediction,=C2=A0 post it =
far and wide, if you think it could help people or save their lives.=C2=A0 =
What does it say about you, if could have helped people, and turned your ba=
ck?

It's this kind of thing that turns believers, and even open-minded peo=
ple, into skeptics.
