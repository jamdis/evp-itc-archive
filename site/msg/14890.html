Yep I agree with Ratka. My preference is to use water to record. There are =
no words so when sentences and entire names are spoken it takes some of the=
 guesswork out of it for me. Again just my personal preference. 
=A0
I also=
 agree that what matters is your intent. If you go in with good intent you =
will get results. I believe Sarah Estep recorded for a month before she got=
 a response (see her book online for clarification) but once she did it inc=
reased dramatically. For me the method matters less than the purpose. I hav=
e gotten the same voices whether using=A0water, sweep tuning, evpmaker, mus=
ical tones, etcetera. They are all just tools as are we. I think our own en=
ergy is the most important factor in the equation.

The running theory is this: The e=
ntity only needs some complex noise source (whatever that may be) in or to =
modulate or demodulate (change) the signal to form communication. A lot of =
the radios are used (Frank's box, shack hacks, minibox or whatever) because=
 they put out a complex noise signal with a lot of human voice tones in the=
m. It is thought that it would be easier for them to manipulate the voice t=
ones than to try to manipulate random noise.

I personally use silence to r=
ecord, which really isn't silence at all but just ambient room noise. The s=
ignal is run through certain filters and I get pretty good solid speech. I =
have worked with different setups such as the hacks and the like but prefer=
 the more basic forms that, to me are more reliable and less questionable.

No matter what you decide to use to record they will all work to some exte=
nt in the end. All you need to communicate is the will, desire and an inter=
ested entity around you.
