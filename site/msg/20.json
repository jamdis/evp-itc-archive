Unless you take it as you&#39;re starting to pay attention more to your=\r\n surroundings, in my oppinion they are always there, always have been, but =\r\nyou didn&#39;t take notice.  Once you start to take notice, ask them for help e=\r\ntc, then the evps and answers to your questions will come.  I also suspect =\r\nthat there is a building type situation going on that would make it easier =\r\nfor them to communicate with you. I have seen the ecto in the shape of horn=\r\ns going into my computer, which is substancial to me when the voices change=\r\n.  It&#39;s all about energy.  We are energy they are energy everything in this=\r\n world is energy, we just need to learn to harness it and use it to get wha=\r\nt we want.  look around your home.  do you see horizontal lights? do you se=\r\ne orbs? if not thats okay, it will happen as you learn to notice things tha=\r\nt you&#39;ve been too busy to see.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Amy=\r\n Swanson \n  To: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, June 13, 2006 3:3=\r\n5 PM\n  Subject: [EVP-ITC] evp\n\n\n\n  well if yall are very expiereinced in th=\r\nis, i just started doing evp&#39;s a few weeks ago!\n  I know that these folks h=\r\nave been around me and some are where i live. the first time i did an evp i=\r\n got nothing till the 3rd time. Then its seems that it opened a door for th=\r\nem, they are conversing amongst themselves saying hello to each other, that=\r\n they can see, they can see the computer, one of them said he was beseiged.=\r\n I didnt record again till yesterday, and i kinda wonder if they are mad? i=\r\n kept getting vibes to record but have been to tired with moving. Can they =\r\nget mad with you? i assume they can. When i recorded, i have been using mic=\r\nrosoft word and typing my questions, and a little bit of talking too, if th=\r\ney can see the computer &lt;so they said&gt; why not?! I also used this thing fro=\r\nm EVP maker that shows pictures and makes clicks and tones. The only thing =\r\nthey had to say was &quot;watch&quot; watch&quot;, wether they ment to not say anything an=\r\nd just watch m e or refering to some of the questions i had, i dont know, c=\r\nant assume anything lol. What can i do to get them to talk to me more? Answ=\r\ner questions? like no one has indentified themselves and i would really lik=\r\ne to know who they are. I have a few people i would like to talk to that ha=\r\nve passed over. However anyone is nice lol. I just would like to open this =\r\ndoor MORE now, that i have closed off. I think that I opened a doorway for =\r\nthem but i want to interact more! People have been refering to me as a &quot;sen=\r\nsitive&quot;? I assume meaning that i am able to tell if they are here etc. Whic=\r\nh i usually can. Is it possible that because in the past for the most part =\r\ni have kept this part of me closed off, except those entities that refuse t=\r\no be silenced come through, that they are skeptical of talking to me? That =\r\ni cant handle it?\n\n  Anyway, justthought id talk with somemore people who h=\r\nave &quot;been there done that&quot;\n  I would like to have someone over who has alot=\r\n of history and do an evp in my home and talk to them for me. &lt;sigs&gt;\n\n  Amy=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/\n\n  LON3_S7AR  YAHOO MESENGER =\r\nID\n  __________________________________________________\n  Do You Yahoo!?\n  =\r\nTired of spam?
