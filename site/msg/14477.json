But =\r\ndirectly storing bits on a media is way beyond that.  Bits are not stored i=\r\nn a continuous stream.  They are broken into bytes (little packets) that is=\r\n totally controlled by the processor and software.  For Elvis to &quot;encode di=\r\nrectly&quot; to the media, he would have to do what that software does to the di=\r\ngital signals coming in from the AtoD converter: he would have to group the=\r\n bits into (for example) 16 little herds each, decide on the specific bit i=\r\nnterpretation scheme (2&#39;s complement?),  find space on the media, update th=\r\ne media&#39;s dictionary of where there is free space and where there isn&#39;t, li=\r\nnk the herds together with some sort of linked pointer, skip around the are=\r\nas marked &#39;bad&#39; on the media, update things like date/time modified and siz=\r\ne, respect any kind of ownership permissions on the media, and so on.\n\n    =\r\n    It is much more credible for the signal to be manipulated near the AtoD=\r\n converter (where EMF changes would have the most straighforward result) th=\r\nan in the digital media itself.\n\n        --- On Wed, 5/20/09, April Abercro=\r\nmbie &lt;april@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          From: April Ab=\r\nercrombie &lt;april@...&gt;\n          Subject: Re: [EVP-=\r\nITC] Re: I have a question.\n          To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n         =\r\n Date: Wednesday, May 20, 2009, 1:05 PM\n\n\n          =EF=BB=BF \n\n          &quot;=\r\nProbably not &quot;directly&quot;, since that would mean grandma would have to have q=\r\nuite an understanding of digital encoding, including which bits mean what, =\r\nwhen, and where.&quot;\n\n          Not necessarily- maybe it is that just by tryi=\r\nng to communicate through our equipment, it happens automatically.
