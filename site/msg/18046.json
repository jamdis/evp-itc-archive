The experiment was for participants to  determine what it wa=\r\ns. \nVague or partial answers wouldn&#39;t be counted  (for example, just colors=\r\n, \nshapes, sizes, what it&#39;s made of, etc):  we&#39;re looking for what it is. \n=\r\nParticipants could use their ghost  boxes, EVP recorders, or I suppose any =\r\nother \nmeans they  chose.\n\nIn order to keep me honest, I took a picture of =\r\nthe  object at the start of \nthe experiment and loaded it to the Files  sec=\r\ntion (RJ folder) of this \ngroup.

Then at the end of the test, I =\r\nwould \n release the password so you could reveal the contents of the file. =\r\n That \nway, you were in control of the original image during the  entire te=\r\nst, not \nme. \n\nThe password for that file is:  123BlastOff\nInstructions, if=\r\n you need them, are also in that RJ  folder.\n\nAnd if you did not care to do=\r\nwnload the zip file  before the test, I will \npost the final image there to=\r\no.\n\nSo to  the results:\n\nNumber of participants: 5\nTotal tries:  8\nAmbiguou=\r\ns answers: 0\nCorrect answers: 0\n\nObject: A  radio\nUzipped picture:\n_http://=\r\ntech. groups.yahoo. com/group/  EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710. \n1.JPG_ (htt=\r\np://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG) \n\nSo wh=\r\nat do the  results mean?
