Sorry I didn&#39;t see your post earlier, \nJules...\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, juli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Gab:\n&gt;             I use Adobe as well.  Just try the scientific filter, \nthen clip and pop reduction and amplify using 3 to 6 boost.  Don&#39;t do \ntoo much more otherwise it will hurt your audio clip.  In addition, \nalways save the original.\n&gt;    \n&gt;             If you want to go through a clip together a few times, \nplease feel free to email me under separate cover and I will be more \nthan happy to assist you.\n&gt;    \n&gt;             Looking forward to hearing your research!\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Juli\n&gt; \n&gt; eastern_paranormal &lt;eparanormal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           I uploaded my first Ghost Box recording to my EVP file \ntoday. I used \n&gt; the same process cleaning it up with Audobe Audition I use with my \n&gt; EVP&#39;s but it seems to need more. Does anyone have Audobe Audition \n&gt; advice for cleaning up that radio static?\n&gt; \n&gt; Gab\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                          \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private & \nconfidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is \naddressed to.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;   No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or \nforwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.\n&gt;"}
