Cool Jill I will check it out when I get time to listen. Its fine its in mp=
3 format. When group gets too full of the mp3 formats then I will let peopl=
e know if they have too much up. I usually suggest if someone wants to uplo=
ad many files they use esnips.com. Or if they want to upload wav files sinc=
e its not allowed here they can use their free esnips account to do whateve=
r format they wish and host multiple files. Glad ya figured out how to tran=
sfer them. I didnt know you didnt know how. Let us know if you have any pro=
blems!

Just realized that I think my file is probably too large =
