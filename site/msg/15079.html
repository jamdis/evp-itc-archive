          Well what I meant was that =
if we are keeping sound separate from the EM spectrum, then it is generated=
 as a bi-product of some other thing's movements or vibrations. Such moveme=

                  No, that's =

 EM waves at the VLF and ULF level can give off sound but only as a seconda=

r ears read as vibration and our mind translates as sound. The waves are st=
ill on the electromagnetic spectrum. Even subsonic geomagnetic waves are pr=

            Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and telemet=

    Here is some food for thought. I am currently reviewing my audio from o=

 my digital voice recorder that I carry with me. We were standing right nex=
t to another digital video recorder that I leave beside my night vision cam=
era. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd voice. I have asked the girl th=
at was with me to check her recording to see if she picked it up.

        =
                        I have long felt the true EVP does not come from so=

          =
                      This instance with the recorders may back that theory=
 up. That other recorder should have picked that voice up if it were sound =
waves in the environment.

                                I am attaching t=
he clip of this 3rd voice. The file that is named "01-02-17 Clip" is the fu=

right after that. I think I know what it says.

     Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear this unt=

                                I ha=
ve a running theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulat=
ed exactly where they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne prin=
ciple. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequency=
 then if you add or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or alte=
rnate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and y=
ou have an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz=
 then you will have a intermediate difference frequency at 9KHz, well withi=
n human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all el=
ectronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. Fr=
om this theory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few inches of=
 the recorder.

                                We are able to reproduce th=
is affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with acou=
stics and audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce called t=
