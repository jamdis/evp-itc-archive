<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That &quot;30&quot; thing is BS.  I believe everyone is surrounded by spirits 
consistently bringing messages to all of us in some way or another. 
Whether we hear them all the time or not is the question, but I would 
suspect we hear them more than we know.  

Now maybe if someone said there were only 30 in the world who could 
operate the thing like a freakin&#x27; walkie talkie and get $150 for 10 
minutes...tee hee

&gt;  #144! That kinda blows the thirty user thing out the window. 
Wonder 
&gt; how many it works for.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] My box is here and set up
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I ran a session last night for the first time, but got nothing. 
&gt; There
&gt; &gt; &gt; are a lot of radio stations in this area (Baltimore-Washington) 
&gt; and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; just could not get a tuning that gave me any confidence that 
what 
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; heard wasn&#x27;t broadcast fragments--and really, nothing came 
through
&gt; &gt; &gt; that made me even wonder if.... Anyway, I went bed last night
&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking that I&#x27;m going to prove the exception to the rule and 
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; won&#x27;t work for me, but I&#x27;m gonna give it a go again today.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any of you tech guys around today if I need some help with 
setting
&gt; &gt; &gt; and other tech issues?
