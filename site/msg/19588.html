thanks Bill, I'm a owner of the spectercam 3..and I must agree! but like yo=
u said all the cams are wonderful.
=C2=A0
Thanks for that perfect descripti=

I also use SpecterCam (SC)on Fact or Faked a=
nd off the show. The SC3 is certainly the most advanced model and I use tha=
t one on the series since at 600 lines, it's the highest resolution and we =
shoot in hi-def. It's priced at $340 but you have the added benefit of an a=
djustable image intensifier (think military night vision goggles) plus auto=
switching power supply between 24VAC or 12VDC for long distance cord runs o=
r battery power. It has many other features.

The SC2 is a good compromise =
between price/performance with 500 lines at $230 plus it has unique feature=
s like motion detection and with 12VDC it can have resonable length power c=
ords or battery power. It is slightly more compact than the SC1 or SC3.

Th=
e SC1 is the way for people who want to experiement with full spec cams to =
get into this research and with 380 lines at $130 its very affordable. It r=
uns on 24VAC so the cord runs can be long enough to go room to room if powe=
r isn't available where you want the camera set up.

All have good sized an=
d sensitive CCD's coupled with a good lens and have 75ohm video out BNC tha=
t you plug into a recorder or DVR. In darkened locations they are fine righ=
t out of the box but if the location is brightly lit, like it was in the Ro=
lling Hills conference room, I attached a douple pass filter that allows UV=
 and IR to pass but inhibits much of the visible spectrum. I did this to av=
oid overexposing the image. I offered the SC1 at $120 at the conference and=
 am glad to extend that deal to anyone here in the group.

I have been offe=
ring the SC cams at all conferences I attend after purchasing them for use =
on the series. I really like them and compared them to other full spectrum =
solutions first. BTW, a more accurate term for virtually all cams that see =
into invisible spectrums is wide spectrum since the lens absorb some of the=
 wavelength but the term full spectrum is what people have come to know. Al=
l of the SC models are capable of capturing very good video and light anoma=
lies are showing up in the invisible spectrums which is encouraging this re=
search.

There are more features of each camera than what I listed here but=
 wanted to list some of the highlights of each to help clarify the differen=
ces between models. 

A new one I now have is the SpecterCamCorder and as t=
he name implies, it has on board media storage via SD cards (not included) =
plus an LCD touchscreen viewfinder. As is the case with all smaller cameras=
, there are limits and advantages to downsizing but the compromise is in th=
e ability to gather light onto the imager. It goes for $284 and is a well d=
one mobile camera that is the best of it's type in my opinion.

I've attached a jpeg with the results of my camera experiment using 1) digi=
tal point n' shoot camera, 2) Moditronics Deep IR camera, 3) Moditronics Fu=
ll ( "Duo") Spectrum camera, and 4) a Nikon camera converted into a Full Sp=

ngle, in a purportedly haunted alley in San Francisco's Chinatown. Please n=
ote that I took these photos during the day, which was one of the reasons I=
 purchased the two Moditronics cameras - their cameras don't see into the v=
isible spectrum and thus prevent against visible light washing out any poss=
ible images that may be lurking in the IR and UV spectrums. And, as you can=
 see from the attached jpeg, in the fire escape one can see what looks like=
 a head floating in the two photos I took with Moditronics Duo Spectrum and=
 Deep IR cameras. In the two photos taken with the regular point n' shoot c=
amera and the full spectrum camera, you can't see
 the floating head at all=
 because the visible light washed it out. Again, for night time investigati=
ons, the drawback with the Moditronics cameras is that you will need some k=

urn on some lights - if lights are available, why sit in the dark?)
