<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>one of the files I posted was in reference to eighteen age boy 
That had hung himself in my town this week.  His name was 
Daniel he was thirteen.  The parents of all the children in the middle 
school were notified that three other teenagers were involved in a 
Suicide pact.  

When I gave the box session I asked if any spirits could help with 
Locating the other three children.  The message I receive pertaining to 
Daniel, was directly after asking about him and the other teenagers.  

The message was giving in forward and in reverse.  The message was 
In it vague but did mention Daniels name and that I could help.  

The next box session will be dedicated solely to information about 
Daniel and the other students involved with him.  I will post any 
Relevant messages.
