<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>But it must raise questions, mustn&#x27;t it, Bruce? Who are these  
entities we are talking to and why would it be such a problem for us  
to know who they were in life? If these are dead humans, it can&#x27;t see  
how it would make any difference at all. In fact, to me, being able  
to talk about human things with them is rather the only way to prove  
that they are dead humans. It does concern me that these entities are  
not human, not because I would particularly care if they were  
extraterrestrial or extradimentional and just admitted that, but  
because my personal desire is to talk to people like me who have  
crossed over.

Can you ask them to give you some sort of reason why they can&#x27;t tell  
you more about themselves?

Well, my 2 cents. I know that my line of inquiry with the box is  
going to be directed at people who have crossed. Maybe I&#x27;ll get some  
answers of my own shortly.

&gt; What I get from mike &amp; Lisa when I ask personal questions about  
&gt; them is a reluctant answer at best.
&gt; I have already thought to ask all of the questions you mention and  
&gt; more and have been answered with
&gt; &quot;NO&quot; &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; and things like &quot;Wait&quot; so I&#x27;m assuming that they are  
&gt; either not allowed or are not ready for me to find
&gt; out about their physical lives. I also get the impression that they  
&gt; want to remain as separate entities in my mind
&gt; and if I where to know who and what they where in the physical it  
&gt; would reduce them to a lower level of spirituality
&gt; in my mind. that is the general jist of the messages as far as that  
&gt; subject goes.

&gt;
&gt; Rambling thoughts:
&gt;
&gt; The sound quality was not as good with this batch. Lots more
&gt; background. Did you change anything?
&gt;
&gt; Okay--I am completely fascinated with who these people are who talk
&gt; to us. I have two, both male, and god knows who they really are,
&gt; because one has changed identity at least six times over the years,
&gt; and one won&#x27;t tell anything at all about himself. Period. Oh, he says
&gt; that he won&#x27;t talk through the box either. I&#x27;m tempted to add, &quot;So
&gt; there&quot; as a direct quote. LOL. Anyway, Mike and Lisa-- So Mike says
&gt; he bled to death in &#x27;95; Lisa choked to death in the 1920s and nuts
&gt; to you for asking, apparently. ;)
&gt;
&gt; Would you ask them some questions for me?
&gt;
&gt; Ask Mike which &#x27;95 he died in--1995 or 1895?
&gt;
&gt; Ask Lisa what her favorite perfume was.
&gt;
&gt; Ask them both more biographical questions, such as where the were
&gt; born, lived, and died. Their full names. Their spouses&#x27; names, kids,
&gt; etc. I&#x27;m a historian/geneologist and I think it would be a blast to
&gt; look in available records to try to identify them.
&gt;
&gt; Ask them the year of their birth. If they tell you, there&#x27;s a lot of
&gt; historical questions I love to ask about events within their  
&gt; lifetimes.
