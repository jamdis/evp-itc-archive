<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello everyone, 

    My name is Tommy Golden and I am the founder of The Middle 
Tennessee Ghost Chasers in Tennessee. I have researched EVP since 1999, 
and saw a youtube video from Mike Coletta and it really raised my 
attention level. I watch the videos, went to radio shack, bought the 
equipment, and modified the 12-469. I recorded my first communication 
and I have to tell you that is has sparked a flame that has been out 
for many years now. I have read almost every article about Frank&#x27;s box 
and seen it in action at Waverly Hills with Chris Moon. Anywho I would 
like to thank you guys for giving me a new investigation tool that 
gives realtime answers. Thanks also great job Mike with those vids and 
step by step direction on your site.</pre>
