Subject: [EVP-ITC] Dropped in to s=
ay hello

=C2=A0 
It's me, SPIRIT_RADIO/Mark. My SPIRIT_RADIO account is fu=
bar right now so I 
logged in with this alias. Any investigations coming up=
? Halloweens right around 
the corner. 


Not much investigating going on, =
work and school keeping me extremely busy. Due 
to this fact, I put some of=
 my equipment on ebay. Sold the EM Pump already. The 
PX is up on the aucti=
on block right now. Can't say it priced at a bargain 
though. The last one =
posted sold for over $400.00 so I feel mine is priced at 
what the market w=
ill bear.

Phone apps are what I use when I'm in an appropriate location. W=
ish Bill 
Chappell would write some for the Android market. I do have his s=
tuff on my 
Itouch though. 


Thought I would stop by. Going to play with t=
he Ouji board now (JK!). I'll check 
back in a bit.

Take Care,

Mark
