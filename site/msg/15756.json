If it continues you and\n&gt; your fake nicknames will be removed. Your attempts to promote your &quot;other\n&gt; group&quot; will be viewed as spam and deleted as such. They may go unnoticed by\n&gt; the group but they dont go unnoticed by me. Funny how its always just that\n&gt; one person/group that you promote while every post you make is not about\n&gt; your research or anyone elses but rather a play on words meant to provoke\n&gt; someone. You should run a quick background check on your friend the owner of\n&gt; that &quot;other group&quot; you may find you know less than you thought you did. You\n&gt; know who you are. And so do I.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As for Frank, he knows I dont always agree with what he says. He knows I\n&gt; definitely dont agree with the namecalling or public venting. Having said\n&gt; that. Frank is the founder of this group. As such he will ALWAYS have a\n&gt; voice here. Those who dont like that or dont agree are free to move on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you are here to learn about EVP-ITC, Frank&#39;s Box, or share your\n&gt; research, by all means do so. If you are here for another purpose then dont\n&gt; be surprised when you go to sign in and find you are no longer a member\n&gt; here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Misty\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Misty,\n&gt;\n&gt; I joined this group a long time ago...pretty much a silent observer. I\n&gt; don&#39;t even read all of the emails I get on updates. I thought when I saw the\n&gt; whole name calling thing it was some sensitive person whining about a spirit\n&gt; saying colorful things to them...then I read a few. ARE THEY SERIOUS. Please\n&gt; know there are many people who agree with you and Frank and agree whole\n&gt; heartedly you should delete the faint of heart...LOL. Can you imagine how\n&gt; they would react to a simple BOO from a voice from beyond?
