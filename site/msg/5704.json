I recorded a spanish language tv program and processed it through evpmaker.  I am including 45 seconds of a 2:45 min session so that anyone in the group might comment on the quality of the recording.  I have been getting zero results...that I can hear...maybe I am doing something wrong technically.  Maybe I am not hearing right.  Any opinions or comments would be appreciated.
