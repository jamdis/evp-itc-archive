For instance once, when I asked if it was OK to wrap up the session, I was very clearly told &quot;Turn off the device.&quot;  Clear as day and in direct response to my question.  No hearing what I want there. \n\nThen again, if any of those commenters had an open enough mind to hear anything at all, I would be surprised.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   The Ghost Box\n&gt; Challenge&lt;http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/802-the-ghost-box-challenge.html&gt;\n&gt; [image:\n&gt; PDF]&lt;http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/802-the-ghost-box-challenge.pdf&gt;\n&gt; [image:\n&gt; Print]&lt;http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/802-the-ghost-box-challenge.html?tmpl=component&print=1&layout=default&page=&gt;\n&gt; [image:\n&gt; E-mail]&lt;http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/mailto/?tmpl=component&link=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yYW5kaS5vcmcvc2l0ZS9pbmRleC5waHAvc3dpZnQtYmxvZy84MDItdGhlLWdob3N0LWJveC1jaGFsbGVuZ2UuaHRtbA%3D%3D&gt;\n&gt;   Swift\n&gt; &lt;http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog.html&gt; Written by Rich\n&gt; Montalvo     Friday, 11 December 2009 11:16\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  From JREF site.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/802-the-ghost-box-challenge.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  I wouldn&#39;t bother with that crap, there&#39;s no way anyone is going to get an\n&gt; honest eval from Randi.\n&gt; \n&gt;  To me, you judge a box, or anything else by what it&#39;s personal meaning is.\n&gt; Do the messages have meaning and coherence, or are they just random\n&gt; disconnected words? When I here my name, and the names of others through to\n&gt; box, I&#39;d have to be a real duffus to think that was just broadcast\n&gt; fragments.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
