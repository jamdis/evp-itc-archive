<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ann, I posted an audio recording under LC&#x27;s RS 12-469 Recordings.  It 
is entitled, &quot;Yes...I am...Gino.&quot; Be sure and listen to it, as it is 
very convincing that these sweeping tuners can be manipulated by 
spirits.

This came through on my 5th try at one sitting. The first four 
attempts that day, I struggled badly.  The audio bits sort of changed 
into patterns of words speaking directly to me.  So I suspect it will 
happen if you continue working with it.  

Maybe Bruce and others can tell us more about how he feels, how quick 
he connects, etc.  I perceive that a connection with the other side 
has to first happen, and this will require your patience, practice 
and spirituality.

&gt; Well, I just ran another and nada. I can hear all the radio 
fragments  
&gt; just fine however, how matter how I tune it. Anyway, I&#x27;m going to  
&gt; give it a rest for awhile and try again later.

&gt; &gt; Ann, you are not alone.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have felt the same at times, but don&#x27;t give up.  I found that  
&gt; &gt; many times I am trying too hard to hear.  You must remain 
patient  
&gt; &gt; and allow time for the spirit(s) to come through after turning 
the  
&gt; &gt; device on.  In other words, let it sweep a bit.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When they did come through for me, I began hearing word bits and  
&gt; &gt; then getting replies to questions.  It is almost like it changes 
to  
&gt; &gt; the trained ear, when it is manipulated.  You may try making  
&gt; &gt; recordings at first and then playing them back a few times.  You  
&gt; &gt; might find you have been missing someone talking to you - 
happened  
&gt; &gt; to me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hope this helps...just my take on things.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I ran a session last night for the first time, but got 
nothing.  
&gt; &gt; There
&gt; &gt; &gt; are a lot of radio stations in this area (Baltimore-
Washington)  
&gt; &gt; and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; just could not get a tuning that gave me any confidence that 
what I
&gt; &gt; &gt; heard wasn&#x27;t broadcast fragments--and really, nothing came 
through
&gt; &gt; &gt; that made me even wonder if.... Anyway, I went bed last night
&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking that I&#x27;m going to prove the exception to the rule and 
this
&gt; &gt; &gt; won&#x27;t work for me, but I&#x27;m gonna give it a go again today.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any of you tech guys around today if I need some help with 
setting
&gt; &gt; &gt; and other tech issues?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
