This experiment asked for participants to determine what that object was. Vague or partial answers won&#39;t be counted (for example, just giving a color, shape, size,  what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re looking for what it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#39;t count.  Participants could use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means they chose.  \n\nIn order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.  The idea with this file is that you could download it at the beginning of the experiment and &#39;keep it safe&#39; on your computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I would post the password so you could reveal the contents of the file. That way, you were in control of the original image during the entire time, not me.  \n\nPassworded pdf: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100730.pdf\n\nThe password for that file is: 867530Nieine\n\nSo to the results:\n\nNumber of participants: 2\nTotal tries: 3\nAmbiguous answers: 0\nCorrect answers: 0\n\nObject: A Pot\nObject picture: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100730.jpg\n\n\nIf anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let me know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this experiment."}
