Sometimes I forget!", "author": "Frank Sumption", "timestamp": "2010-05-25T18:52:53Z", "full_text": "I often forget about the multiple levels that come through the box. Why\nwouldn&#39;t there be a level where Jesus 4exists and is active? At 8 seconds in\nthe this test vidoe&quot;M5-Bonnie visits--and tells you who&#39;s there&quot;, or am I\nmistaking the Jesus contacts with someone else? Anyway, I&#39;m guessing M5 is a\ndemension, or level of spirit.\n\n You can&#39;t take anything as gospel truth cuz ya just do not know who is\ntaking and from what level. Back in the Olden Days when I was using EVPmaker\nI use to get my mother in-law, until in one session her friends said &quot;joanne\ngot a new body and moved up two steps&quot; and that&#39;s the last I heard from her.\nSo steps--levels--demensions??\n\n Point is, there are too many hard feeling generated by many trying to be\ntoo serious about this stuff, and trying to claim it&#39;s this way or that\nway.  You&#39;re having fun--damn it!\n\n Frank-S\n\nI o en o ge abou he mul iple le els ha come h ough he box. Why wouldn' he e be a le el whe e Jesus 4exis s and is ac i e?
