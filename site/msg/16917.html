Hi All,

I'm new to this group, and to the practical side of EVP, so after =
reading a few posts I thought I would introduce myself and also ask for som=
e advice.

First, those ghost boxes look great! I'd love to make one, but m=
y electrical knowledge is non-existent. Are there any good websites out the=
re that I can learn the basics of electronics from? Or in the meantime is t=
here some makeshift thing I can do, like just manually moving the dial of m=
y radio?

Secondly, I have tried several EVP recordings, and not really got=
ten anything. I had one interesting comment that I hear from using EVP Make=
r with the Allophones voice samples. I asked "are there any spirits here?" =
and the answer I got was "No we are not here right now". I don't readily ha=
ve access to any known haunted sites, although I will be checking out some =
cemetaries soon. My theory, based on reading the works of more experienced =
people is that the more you work with EVP the more you begin to recieve mes=
sages. Almost like you begin to stand out on their map and they flock to yo=
u. I think this is in some ways equivalent to being a medium. Would any of =
you agree with that idea? What I'm getting at is that my hope is that the m=
ore I attempt to record EVP hopefully there is more chance of my getting EV=
PS regardless of the location I am at. 

Thirdly, I have done some reading =
on reverse speech and did have quite a shock with one recording of myself t=
hat definitely went into subconscious material. Do any of you work with rev=
ersing your EVPs? There is some FAR OUT material on the web on reverse spee=
ch, but I think using the protocols you all use you can still get good stuf=
f from it.



Anthony
