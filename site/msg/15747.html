Zack,

I do not meen to offend anyone but I do not think just because you a=
re a person who started this forum that you have the rite to insult and off=
end people for speaking there opinion.

Is that not what this and other gro=
ups are about. someone else said the rules here are if you are insulting or=
 mean then you will be baned does that not go for every one or is it just a=
 few people can say what they want and others will be baned ?

I said I did=
 not meen to insult anyone but I feel there is an injustuce here and favora=
tsm wich is wrong in any group.

why is it do as i say not as i do. the rul=
es should be for everyone no matter what. if you aply this thinking to ever=
y thing we would be living in a world were people were in prison for doing =
a crime and the people in goverment could do as they please to sell drugs o=
r kill or whatever and get away with it.

we should not have to be USED TO =
someone who can akt and insult who ever he wants too when ever he wants too=
.

that is my opinion.
pleese forgive my english.

John

Well, it's his group (he doesn=

Those of us who have been around here half of forever are used to =
him and aren't offended.
