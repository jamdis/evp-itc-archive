<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I often forget about the multiple levels that come through the box. Why
wouldn&#x27;t there be a level where Jesus 4exists and is active? At 8 seconds in
the this test vidoe&quot;M5-Bonnie visits--and tells you who&#x27;s there&quot;, or am I
mistaking the Jesus contacts with someone else? Anyway, I&#x27;m guessing M5 is a
demension, or level of spirit.

 You can&#x27;t take anything as gospel truth cuz ya just do not know who is
taking and from what level. Back in the Olden Days when I was using EVPmaker
I use to get my mother in-law, until in one session her friends said &quot;joanne
got a new body and moved up two steps&quot; and that&#x27;s the last I heard from her.
So steps--levels--demensions??

 Point is, there are too many hard feeling generated by many trying to be
too serious about this stuff, and trying to claim it&#x27;s this way or that
way.  You&#x27;re having fun--damn it!
