Believe me hit has gotten me into \nsome tight situations in the past, but has also served me well in some \nsituations.\n\nBe that as it may, I would like to let everyone here know that when I \noffer advice or an answer to a question and it seems like an order or \ncondicending attitude, That is not my inttention. There are many more \npeople that have been here longer than me and have more experience \nmaybe I should learn when and how to be a bit more humble.\n\nIf I have offended anyone please accept my appologies.\n\nBruce"}
