A tiny (relatively) echo box. In recent boxes the echo box was 2 X 6 X 8 
inches, I need to to get that size down, this one is 3 1/2 X 4-1/4 X 3/4 
inches. The size choice was arbitrary, and the metal was scrap stuff at 
work, the top &amp; bottom are aluminum, and the side and channel seperators are 
galvanized &quot;tin&quot; also scarp from work.  I have used boxes as large as 4 feet 
long, and a foot square, but some of the voices were so negative it was 
frightening, but that may have because it worked so well the darkheads 
wanted to scare me off of that approach. It looks like the camera lens was 
not pointed all the way straight(it pivots).
