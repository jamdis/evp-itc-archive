You can\n&gt; purchase  \n&gt; different avatars, clothing, accessories, etc...\n&gt; for your avatar. Second Life currency is called\n&gt; &quot;Lindens&quot;. You can by  \n&gt; quite a lot of lindens for a couple of bucks via Paypal.\n&gt; You can also get many avatars and clothes, costumes, you\n&gt; name it, for  \n&gt; free. There are a lot of &quot;freebie&quot; type places on\n&gt; SL.\n&gt; \n&gt; For a long time, I got everything free and had a lot of fun\n&gt; playing  \n&gt; with my avatar. You can get pretty creative. I once saw\n&gt; Jesus float by  \n&gt; and angels were singing around him - it was a riot - and\n&gt; later saw a  \n&gt; very strange looking Elvis. You can be anything in SL.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many different spiritual & metaphysical groups meet in\n&gt; SL. They have  \n&gt; places to meditate, talk, you name it. It&#39;s a lot of\n&gt; fun to explore.\n&gt; \n&gt; For a recording group, I was envisioning meeting once or\n&gt; twice a month  \n&gt; (or more) to discuss our research and perhaps even try to\n&gt; record as a  \n&gt; group... combine energies. Might be fun & interesting!\n&gt; \n&gt; w.\n&gt; On Aug 19, 2008, at 3:12 PM, Ron Lederer wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; w.  I checked out the site quickly.  Looks like a\n&gt; monthly charge is  \n&gt; &gt; involved or no?  I will get back to it again when I\n&gt; have more time.   \n&gt; &gt; What do you envision with a recording group...I might\n&gt; be  \n&gt; &gt; interested?  ron l\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;"}
