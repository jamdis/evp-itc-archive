I do=\r\nn&#39;t think that&#39;s usable for my purposes. I use a square wave that goes thro=\r\nugh an integrator to convert it a triangle, so the voltage sweeps up smooth=\r\nly, then back down smoothly. It&#39;s possible to run op amps on a single suppl=\r\ny with some biasing tricks. I might try that combined with the square wave =\r\noutput of a 555.

Random in the new box would not work at t=\r\nhe Stanely. Some have requested I leave it in, but it&#39;s just not worth the =\r\nheadache. \n \n The system can be simplified, like leave out the mic amps, an=\r\nd sound chamber, providing only a line output to go to a recorder, and spea=\r\nker driver. It&#39;s been my experience recently that spirits do not need the s=\r\nound chamber(aka echo box), and recording directly from a swept tuner works=\r\n just fine, and results in possibly clearer communications. There&#39;s less pl=\r\naces to introduce distortion and noise. Random results in broken up voices =\r\nand phrases, and longer broadcast fragments.

Curiously, people that speak whatever language you u=\r\nse don&#39;t hear the messages. You could even use stuff off the web, like Chin=\r\nese news or whatever. This stuff is trickier, cuz some of what is heard cou=\r\nld be a trick of the mind, but that&#39;s true with any method. I did use this =\r\nup hunting last year, and the other guys could hear the messages I was gett=\r\ning using Chinese shortwave--they also heard the english messages mixed in =\r\nwith Chinese. It&#39;s not just the occasional word that sounds like English, i=\r\nt&#39;s coherent phrases with meaning to the person doing the recording.
