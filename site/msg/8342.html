<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

what could be tried next is using &quot;true&quot; random instead of the
mathematical pseudo random number generator, which perhaps gives &quot;them&quot;
more possibilities to influence the system. To achieve this, the output
of a radio which is tuned to &quot;white noise&quot; (or hiss) can be connected to
the input of the soundcard, and in EVPmaker the option &quot;Extras &gt; Random
Source &gt; Sound card&quot; can be selected to make the program read the
noise signal from the radio and use it as a source for random numbers.
Perhaps it&#x27;s easier for the &quot;guys&quot; (&amp; gals) to influence the radio in
order to send us their messages. Who knows...?

&gt; Hey guy&#x27;s,

&gt; I think we may be on to something here.
&gt; I think this method has a huge amount of poential.
&gt; It was just a matter of time before someone hit on the correct file to 
&gt; use with that program.
