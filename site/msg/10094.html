<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ann,

How true your post is.  When i started about a year ago on this 
board, there were only 3 people i know of doing box research at all. 
I was using the joe&#x27;s box and chris moon and frank with frank&#x27;s box.  
I think when i got on this board, there were 50 or 60 people on here 
and it was really quiet.  Misty i think was doing some manual sweeps 
along with water methods and other attempts at evp&#x27;s.  There is so 
many people having the opportunity to test these devices now, because 
they are available.  It&#x27;s impossible to help them all, i know i&#x27;ve 
tried to help my share.  All i can do is offer suggestions of how i 
came about doing this, but nobody helped me at all get started.  I 
think that&#x27;s important that i learned how to do this on my own, 
others should do the same.  There are so many styles to use and 
creating new methods are always there as a possibility.  Just 
experiment and see where the road leads you, try new ideas and see 
what happens.

&gt; As hard as it may be to understand now, less than a year ago this 
was  
&gt; a small, quiet list of researchers who knew each other or each  
&gt; other&#x27;s reputation well enough to know we were all after the same  
&gt; thing. Now this place is grand central station and no one knows 
each  
&gt; other and the people here have *widely* varying agendas. The ones 
who  
&gt; think we need to regulate everything with a mind to providing 
proof  
&gt; to the public and skeptics may well out-number those of us who no  
&gt; longer care about winning other hearts and minds other than our 
own.  
&gt; I dunno. But recognition of both mindsets will have to be in place 
or  
&gt; all it will do is spawn more flame wars.

&gt; &gt; I know Im a newbie too but I can see your point and agree that  
&gt; &gt; taking out some of the dead air, static with no words and the 
click  
&gt; &gt; click click click(of the 469) that comes in between words cant  
&gt; &gt; hurt...as long as people arent cutting words out from other  
&gt; &gt; sections of the session and pasting them to fit with their  
&gt; &gt; questions...and as long as they arent waiting 30 secs or more 
and  
&gt; &gt; counting any type of response as a response to that paticular  
&gt; &gt; question.(if that makes sense).  I dont see how cutting out dead  
&gt; &gt; air or static or clicking can make someone less of a serious

&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t think anyone would wait 30 seconds after a question and
&gt; &gt; associate a word or phrase to be the answer to that question.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also in a thirty second period if the researcher has not asked  
&gt; &gt; another question and moved on
&gt; &gt; someone should try and help them with how they are doing a 
session.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You Know I clip all the useless fragment crap out of my files, 
are  
&gt; &gt; you trying to say you hold your research to a higher
&gt; &gt; degree than I do?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And because the crap sounds are cut from a file does not make it  
&gt; &gt; pieced together.
&gt; &gt; If a researcher is taking words from different parts of a 
recording  
&gt; &gt; and putting them together to make a sentence
&gt; &gt; that would be piecing them together, that would be an out and 
out  
&gt; &gt; fake.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As long as the researcher has the original clip to present upon  
&gt; &gt; request by a reputable source, that should prevent
&gt; &gt; questions of the files validity.

&gt; &gt; if you clip them  and put together  the answer  how will you 
know  
&gt; &gt; that it was a excepted amount of time?if you ask a question  and  
&gt; &gt; receive  a answer
&gt; &gt; after 30seconds  to me and what i post is unacceptable. but then 
i  
&gt; &gt; hold my reasearch to a high degree than most .30 seconds might 
not  
&gt; &gt; sound like a lot  but  your phone rings  7 times  in 30 seconds.  
&gt; &gt; any clip i hear that arre pieced together also  i ignore. sorry

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; Here’s my take…or 2 cents worth..:-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Share your files all clipped without the garbage for others to  
&gt; &gt; listen to. Save your original files for further development and  
&gt; &gt; records, in the case a scientific organization wants to 
“hear”  
&gt; &gt; the original along with the clipped, walahh you have both. And  
&gt; &gt; everyone is Happy!

&gt; &gt; Bruce    To add to what you said, the capacity of the yahoo 
forum  
&gt; &gt; we are with does not permit long recordings and the messages we  
&gt; &gt; have been receiving seem to be getting longer and longer each  
&gt; &gt; passing month.  Not much room for the &quot;gargage.&quot;  I for one 
prefer  
&gt; &gt; to hear the important message words, knowing full well the 
author  
&gt; &gt; edited the file.  If someone wants to present false stuff so 
that  
&gt; &gt; he or she gets false praise from us,  god bless them if they 
need  
&gt; &gt; the praise.  For scientific research with original files...that&#x27; 
s  
&gt; &gt; another story.  Ron L

&gt; &gt; Stefan,

&gt; &gt; I do remove the &quot;garbage&quot; from my files.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At this point in my research, the message is more important to 
me  
&gt; &gt; than the proof of it.
&gt; &gt; I think most of us here will agree that we are receiving some 
sort  
&gt; &gt; of paranormal communication.
&gt; &gt; but it definitely exists. now we need to concentrate on the  
&gt; &gt; messages they need us to hear and the answers to the questions
&gt; &gt; we ask and in turn our answers to their questions. Anyone that  
&gt; &gt; cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the 
file
&gt; &gt; that has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously  
&gt; &gt; garbage like the &quot;EH O EH AH O EH UR&quot; in between words.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For example &quot;Is there anyone here that wishes to communicate_  
&gt; &gt; YES_AH ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE&quot;
&gt; &gt; It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return to 
a  
&gt; &gt; file that I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold 
some
&gt; &gt; relivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly  
&gt; &gt; listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At this stage in real time communication the messages are the 
top  
&gt; &gt; priority.
&gt; &gt; I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained  
&gt; &gt; and made available to individuals that make a request
&gt; &gt; for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may 
be  
&gt; &gt; made, and god knows there are always fanatical
&gt; &gt; sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to 
attack  
&gt; &gt; an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that
&gt; &gt; our research files should be made available on request by every 
tom  
&gt; &gt; dick and harry that is unknown to us and may potentially
&gt; &gt; doctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the  
&gt; &gt; researcher that receives the request for raw research data should
&gt; &gt; scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment 
before  
&gt; &gt; handing out any research data.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file.

&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I 
would
&gt; &gt; suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a 
whole, in
&gt; &gt; order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can 
for
&gt; &gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip 
(including
&gt; &gt; the experimenter&#x27; s voice), filter or denoise it to make it  
&gt; &gt; clearer, but
&gt; &gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an 
EVP  
&gt; &gt; match
&gt; &gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should 
always
&gt; &gt; be provided along with the edited version.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But that&#x27;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to  
&gt; &gt; express, as
&gt; &gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical 
public.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Stefan
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -- 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these 
files.
&gt; &gt; &gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that
&gt; &gt; &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the 
message
&gt; &gt; &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise 
that
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#x27;t belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can&#x27;t piece 
these
&gt; &gt; &gt; files together to make something it&#x27;s not, so i keep them in 
true
&gt; &gt; &gt; form pretty much to the original.
