I&#39;ve heard my own mother speaking, my great Aunt \n&gt; Hazel Lilly with her husband Ralph say their own names, using their own \n&gt; voices. Why don&#39;t you folks believe them? They are not from outer \n&gt; space, they are not radio fragments, nor are they monsters and demons, these are \n&gt; people like us, thathave left this physical world, to live in the world of \n&gt; spirit. How can any of you doubt when they are all around us? \n&gt; sf\n&gt;"}
