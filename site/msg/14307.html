<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, what you hear is what you hear. What I hear is what I hear. If they&#x27;re
different, no biggie to me.

Having spent hundreds of hours in a darkroom making fine-art prints, I see
things in photos that most people don&#x27;t. That doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t
there. And I never could figure out how those judges see all of that stuff
in figure skaters&#x27; performances that I don&#x27;t see. But it doesn&#x27;t upset me.

&gt;   Soooo, everyone hears different, and personally I find it offensive when
&gt; someone presumes to tell everyone what another researhcer&#x27;s voices really
&gt; say. I think EVP messages are for the one that recorded thmm, to everyone
&gt; else it&#x27;s non-sense, except there&#x27;s enough to show that there is a
&gt; phenomenon.
&gt;
&gt;  I get really tired of these self proclaimed experts trying to dicate
&gt; what&#x27;s acceptable.

&gt;&gt; I opened your folder and examined all your files.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Here are my opinions (I have truncated the file names due to laziness):
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; ahh_mmm noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; call_us noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; cal_us (enhanced) several listenings: pixelated, no speech
&gt;&gt; compare_panasonic noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; compare_sony noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; first_epv noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; good_whistle noises, no speech (maybe feedback)
&gt;&gt; hey_can noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; hey_whats noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; I_hit noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; important_date noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; keep_moving several listenings: Hellalal see woobeh
&gt;&gt; laugh_evp noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; lets_wait several listenings: noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; maybe_gun noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; miss_you noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; my_question several listenings: no da lee
&gt;&gt; oh_ noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; something several listenings: noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; that_mans noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; that&#x27;s_jim noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; this_one several listenings: noises, no speech
&gt;&gt; tomorrow noises, no speech
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The ones that took several listenings I thought I might hear words in, so
&gt;&gt; I examined those several times. Sometimes I could sort of hear something
&gt;&gt; that sort of sounded like what you suggested, but I could also hear it in
&gt;&gt; other ways, or not at all.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So my suggestion to you, if you want to get less subjective conjuctures or
&gt;&gt; simply less affirmations of your own interpretations, is to post the future
&gt;&gt; ones without labels. The labels you give can influence the listeners: when
&gt;&gt; you have a sound that could be several things, and you note that it sounded
&gt;&gt; like &quot;keep it moving&quot;, the listener can find it nearly impossible to try NOT
&gt;&gt; to hear what you heard, and so not be able to give a fresh perspecive to
&gt;&gt; help your research methods.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Go to my Folder in the files section &quot;Jim&#x27;s RR-DR60 EVP&#x27;s&quot; and see if
&gt;&gt; anyone (needs to) decide &quot;FOR ME&quot; and let me know if I am of the serious
&gt;&gt; type. In my short time I have gathered enough &quot;proof&quot; for myself that this
&gt;&gt; method works for ME. And from what I have seen from others that I have let
&gt;&gt; &quot;listen&quot; to my files (friends) I am blessed with the &quot;ability&quot; to HEAR very
&gt;&gt; low audio artifacts....so this will help me in my RESEARCH. And I am OPEN to
&gt;&gt; any help to reach my goals (or help others) with their goals. Have fun
&gt;&gt; people. On a HAPPIER NOTE :) I was lucky enough to catch the RR-DR60 taking
&gt;&gt; a nap yesterday....it missed a few evp&#x27;s real close together (in a 5 second
&gt;&gt; clip) the Sony ICD-B7 heard a male use a different number than what I used.
&gt;&gt; I said 16 (my earlier age I was saying in recorder) and the male evp said
&gt;&gt; 13....then a female laughs. All this was missed by the DR60 (except my 16
&gt;&gt; was recorded in both recorders) BUT then the DR60 &quot;caught&quot; the B7 &quot;napping&quot;
&gt;&gt; at near the end of the 5 second clip....the DR60 heard &quot;let me out&quot; in a
&gt;&gt; clear (quite) males voice. So this is very promising piece of evidence for
&gt;&gt; me. **those 2 recordings have been uploaded to my folder. I will include an
&gt;&gt; Olympus W-10 (soon as arrives), Panasonic RR-US360 (when I think to grab it)
&gt;&gt; and my RR-QR80 to go with my RR-QR100, and one more (can&#x27;t remember what
&gt;&gt; brand-model of this last---due to arrive) LOL. I need to build a multiple
&gt;&gt; mounting devise to aid in putting these into tandem service. Then I think I
&gt;&gt; will use my Olympus DS-50 as my &quot;Control&quot; recorder....by using it on the HQ
&gt;&gt; settings. I am looking to build a &quot;subsonic&quot; microphone also (something to
&gt;&gt; do with those low &quot;booms&quot; that I have noticed lead or follow many evp&#x27;s). So
&gt;&gt; I look forward to any ideas. Falure is NOT an option. Haha.....
