<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is great! I think it shows that it&#x27;s the raw audio that matters. To me 
there seems to be many that think my boxes are like somekind of oracle or 
something, and they miss the fact that it&#x27;s only supplying the raw audio for 
spirits to form their voices with. I don&#x27;t want to cheapen the experience, 
but I want to show that it is more of a science now, it&#x27;s repeatable, and 
other systems can be made that do the same thing. This FM scan method has 
the advantage of fewer parts, smaller boards, and seemingly easier to use. I 
think this system would be marketable.

Thanks Steve for posting your voices!

Frank
