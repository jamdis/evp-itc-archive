 Oh yeah, btw, I did get the sockets in I was waiting for, that's why the =
work on the RNG part of the Speakjet board.   I think I've always had this =
weird mis-match problem with the white noise circuit, but going from op amp=
 stage to op amp stage as in the RVG, it's not as apparent. There could be =
a number of factors, maybe just changing the op amp type would solve the pr=
oblem(?) I was seeking a more universal solution with the addition of the b=
uffer stage, so it won't matter so much which op amp is used.
