OHHHHHHH LOL, thanks for clearing something up in my head. I'll try and vice versa that with this reply. 
   
  I was listening to C2C not long ago and they were saying something about Art's new baby's picture being up on the webcam so I went there and saw little "Parump" and I am sitting there wondering hmmm wonder if thats phillipines name or is its from little drummer boy (parump a pum pum)
   
  Now I know where it came from, and you know what Art is up to. Still trying to part time it from overseas at his new home with his new wife and son, and said he was retiring but I dont think people will allow him to do that. So for now I think he is mostly doing occasional special interest shows, someone correct me if I am wrong I dont get a chance to tune in every show LOL
