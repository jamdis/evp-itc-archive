<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Even when doing the test videos, I just announce out loud I&#x27;m doing an EVP
recording. Even with these it&#x27;s like they are right there and ready. There
seems to be some, or a group that actually transmit something, and
participants stand in front of, or use a mic of somekind. When I first
started, box #1, &quot;they&quot; had Lincoln, and were showing him how to use the
mic. Chicken skin just thinking about it!

 Like this one, starts out &quot;you don&#x27;t believe&quot; sung, I think it&#x27;s a
remodulated song from Radio Disney. I try to explain to them, I look in a
mirror, and that ain&#x27;t alien Princess looking back! It&#x27;s a difficult
concept. This was manual sweep with a minimal &quot;box&quot;.

&gt;   Tim,
&gt;
&gt; I experience something similar on a regular basis.
&gt;
&gt; My &quot;crew&quot; usually begins immediately (sometimes less than 20 or 30 seconds
&gt; and often as soon as the box is turned on) with my name and the words *
&gt; &quot;START&quot;,* *&quot;Here&quot;* or *&quot;Hello&quot;* to show me that we&#x27;ve made proper contact
&gt; and the connection is clear.
&gt;
&gt; The sessions typically end in much the same way with a loud* &quot;STOP!&quot;* or *
&gt; &quot;end&quot;* to signal that we&#x27;re finished.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve attached an example of my own and thank you for sharing!
&gt;
&gt; It&#x27;s incredibly interesting to read about and hear the communication
&gt; &quot;systems&quot; employed by other researchers.
