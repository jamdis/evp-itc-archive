It needs a program\n&gt; called &quot;firmware&quot; put into it before it will do anything useful. The\n&gt; chips have a program memory which comes blank when you buy\n&gt; them.The &quot;code&quot; is the representation of what is called machine\n&gt; language that tells the various parts of the microcontroller what to\n&gt; do. In this case, I imagine it increases a voltage with a certain\n&gt; pattern and then drops it down to zero, starting over again and\n&gt; repeating at a certain rate. This would produce a repetitive sweep of\n&gt; the radio at a certain rate when the microcontroller is hooked up to\n&gt; the radio correctly.It wouldn&#39;t be difficult for me to write my own\n&gt; program to do this with a PIC microcontroller, but if someone else\n&gt; has already done it, why bother?If I can&#39;t get my hands on the\n&gt; machine code, I&#39;ll write some myself.ZackOn Fri, 4 Jan 2008, mllejade\n&gt; wrote:&gt; Frank, please let me know if you should, for whatever reason,\n&gt; decide&gt; to sell that chip (to control the scan rate of the &#39;469).

I&gt; think if I used the muffled sound consistently\n&gt; they would talk&gt; through it though, the goal being to get higher\n&gt; level voices, and&gt; audio. The clarifier is just a low pass filter\n&gt; that can be adjusted--&gt; just an idea.&gt; I have some female guides that\n&gt; speak sometimes, and&gt; there&#39;s the seven sisters that come though\n&gt; sometimes, but I don&#39;t&gt; know much about that. &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt; &gt; &gt; To:\n&gt; EVP-ITC@: debbie@: Wed, 2&gt; Jan 2008 10:33:33 -0700Subject: Re: [EVP-\n&gt; ITC] The &#39;470 mod?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Frank, Thanks for the extra\n&gt; instructions, it doesn&#39;t sound too&gt; difficult for me so I&#39;ll give it\n&gt; a shot. &gt; &gt; By the way, I did listen&gt; to your tone control clip.\n&gt; Since I&#39;m new to this my comments are&gt; probably not &quot;worth&quot; much at\n&gt; this point. I thought the entire clip&gt; itself was a lot smoother and\n&gt; clearer than most I&#39;ve heard so far&gt; from various sources (the mixed\n&gt; station sounds are in smaller pieces&gt; so for someone like me it would\n&gt; be easier to pick out the EVPs as&gt; opposed to entire words from radio\n&gt; announcers). The short piece about&gt; 2/3 of the way through, where I&#39;m\n&gt; guessing you used a clarifier,&gt; sounded muffled to me, which makes me\n&gt; think it would also muffle the&gt; EVPs. Definitely easier on the ears\n&gt; but for someone inexperienced&gt; (and I seem to be the only one here!)\n&gt; it seems it would be harder to&gt; pick out the real words too.&gt; &gt; By\n&gt; the way, in listening to the&gt; deluge of clips uploaded last night, I\n&gt; can&#39;t help but notice that the&gt; voices are all men. Just curious --\n&gt; is that always the case?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&gt; &gt; Debbie\n&gt; Tejada&gt; &gt; &quot;Once you can accept&gt; the universe as matter expanding into\n&gt; nothing that is something,&gt; wearing stripes with plaid comes easy. &quot;\n&gt; ~Albert Einstein&gt; &gt; On Jan&gt; 2, 2008, at 10:22 AM, Frank Sumption\n&gt; wrote:&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have&gt; the &#39;470, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the\n&gt; older one or not.
