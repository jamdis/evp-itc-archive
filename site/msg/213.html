Frank,
I''ve been dabbling with DRV the last couple days. I did have a smal=
l success a couple days ago. When did you get your 170 message? 

Attached =
is a very brief communication.  Spirit says "hello" then I say "heyyyy"  on=
 play back it sounds like "hello you"  a couple other times I heard them tr=
y to speak but I couldn't understand them.  I'm also attaching one that I d=
idn't understand right away. Joe is my oldest son.  I got these on 610 AM b=
ut I can't get anything on my stereo the last couple days but clicks and so=
me broadcasts.  I did reverse some broadcasts and got some messages out of =
them, regarding changing my frequency, but I haven't noticed anything diffe=
rent.

   Speaking of radio, I got a voice that I didn't copy t=

id to "call 70", which to me is the 70 cm ham band, which I do have a rig f=
or. 

   My wife no believe this either, I can see her actually turn off as=
 I start talking ghosts, or the electronics involved. You'd think with her =
close call she would be more interested, but I think the necromonger brainw=
ashing from the doctors is already too deep. Necromonger for lack of a bett=
er term, "our culture of fear of death society", so bozo doctors can get ri=
ch. 



   I have the RVG side of a second micro system working. I don't th=
ink I'll try using the surface mount parts on the next systems. It's a real=
 pain to repair the surface mount boards if a part goes bad, like I had las=
t night.  I can always tell if there's a problem, cuz I'm real reluctant to=
 get started on a problem board, not knowing that there actually is a probl=
em. I drug my feet for almost a month ion this system, or course part of th=
at was due to being tied up with the younger grand son.

  I agree but if it is them that are not =

tingly,  I posted this evp on a message board when I received it back in De=
cember and got a lot of slack from a chic on the board.  She was the bigges=

honestly don't care, who believes me or not. So this could have been a warn=
