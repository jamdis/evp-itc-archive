I&#39;ve tried to record while the ham \nbands were open, and it didn&#39;t seem to make any difference. I have noticed \nthough that when I first started using my boxes I was getting voices coming \nin like gangbusters as they say, but it tapered off to almost nothing by \ncomparison, as did the ham bands with the solar cycle dropping. ( me&#39;s a \nextra class ham).\n\nI have my new board all working up to the audio amps, there&#39;s seems to be an \nimpedance mismatch between the tuner and the amplifiers. I&#39;m working on a \nbuffer to place in between them.\n\nI made the sweep frequency adjustment a panel mount control, so it can be \nchanged depending onthe band being used, and the conditions that are \napparent by the way the voices come in.\n\n\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet a FREE Web site, company branded e-mail and more from Microsoft Office \nLive! http://clk.atdmt.com/MRT/go/mcrssaub0050001411mrt/direct/01/"}
