First I will suggest you use the feedback loop with your webcam just to let &quot;them&quot; know you have genuine interest. \n   \n  There is a program called &quot;My Screen Cam&quot; which is free and allows you to show what you are recording while you record it at full screen. Most software that comes with webcams only show a smaller screen. Those work well too but are harder to see and I used my webcam software for a while til I found better programs. \n   \n  Once you have this installed and running fine simply aim the webcam directly at the screen so it records itself recording itself.....feedback loop.\n   \n  I found it useful to hold the webcam rather than lock it in a stationary position, and I move/swing it back and forth getting different angles of the screen. Soon you start to see bright flashes of light, and in this light you may find some images.\n   \n  To do that you will need to have hit record and recorded a minute or so to review. Then review it using a program such as Sport Video Player which will allow you to review it frame by frame because often at normal speed you miss it. Then just go over your recording until you have looked at each frame....yes this can take hours thats why I suggest you only record a minute or two.\n   \n  Once you start getting results you will be ready to try the tv thing. I&#39;ll explain that in detail more when you get set up using the loop and when I am feeling better (lil sick today). So then you will have all the software needed.\n  \nI still use both methods and get results both ways.\n   \n   \n  Misty\nAmy Swanson &lt;lon3_s7ar@...&gt; wrote:\n            Okay, so my camcorder is a w r e c k! i cant get the tape door to close and the battery is completly shot.
