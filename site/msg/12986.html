Hello Laura,
=A0
I think it is really nice that you want to recognize othe=
rs for their work. I do support that. As long as there won't be many posts =
on this site.=A0 I like to keep each of these groups separate.
=A0
I will t=
ry to go back later and check the site out.

this group. I do not normally send out invites , this is my first as this i=

, make friends, promote their work and ideas on this new site. And to give =
the an award for their hard earned work!! =A0I hope that you will go visit =

I would pref=

Please don't make me hesitate to open EVP-IT=
