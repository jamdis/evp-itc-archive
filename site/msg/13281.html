<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Chad,

Thanks again for participating and for sending your files.
No, I didn&#x27;t get everyone who I mailed debris to participate.  If 
they did do sessions, a couple didn&#x27;t send any files to me.  One 
person is still planning to send some just so I can hear them.

I sent out 9 debris packages and got 5 sets of files in return... a 
good investment.

I need to listen to the files a few more times to see if there are 
things I may have missed.  When dealing with the Radio Shack hacks or 
Franks Box, there is so much information being put out of the 
speaker.  It&#x27;s easy to miss something if you aren&#x27;t really focused.
I heard your &quot;the 20&quot; reply very clear and I knew about the passenger 
count, so it was easy to relate the items quickly.

Yes, I got what I expected from all the files.  It was a good mixture 
of methods and the data is there for further review.
The instructions were followed pretty much, with a few files a bit 
longer than 30 seconds, so I used the shorter ones, but still have 
some of the longer ones for review too.

Would I do this again..??  Yes.. I think I would.  I really 
appreciated all the willingness of those who were interested.

Again... thanks for your help and thanks for your kind words!

- Mike C.

&gt; I am glad you finished the video Mike! I enjoyed getting to hear 
what
&gt; everyone else sent in, as well as what your results were. I am 
curious
&gt; as to whether or not you got full participation once you sent out 
the
&gt; debris. Did everyone follow your instructions? Did you get files 
from
&gt; everyone you send debris to? Did you get better or worse results 
than
&gt; you expected? Would you attempt something like this again?
&gt; 
&gt; I was very excited to participate in the research and am planning on
&gt; doing more with the debris in the future. Just wanted to 
say &quot;thanks&quot;
&gt; and keep up the great work. I think your experiments and willingness
&gt; to share your work are a shining example to all in the paranormal 
field.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope everyone enjoyed this as much as I did. I plan on doing a 
write
&gt; up on our website about the experiment in the near future. I&#x27;d like 
to
&gt; hear from the other researchers on their experience with this 
project...
