He also claims that reverse speech messages are almost always linked\nto the forward speech message.\n\nSome of his examples are quite intriguing, but I don&#39;t buy it fully yet.  I\nhave recorded my own voice and played it backwards and got zilch.\n\nBut, if there is some truth to it, maybe we should all be reversing some of\nour files from time to time just in case.  Wouldn&#39;t it be a startling find\nto have this be true not only of the living, but also in those who\ncommunicate through the box a well.\n\nhttp://www.reversespeech.com/Simple_Examples.htm\n\n&lt;http://www.reversespeech.com/Simple_Examples.htm&gt;Tim\n\nOn Tue, Nov 30, 2010 at 5:46 PM, Frank Sumption\n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  [Attachment(s) &lt;#12c9ef77032341cf_TopText&gt; from Frank Sumption included\n&gt; below]\n&gt;\n&gt; Just about yelling it now.
