Sure Jim send it to my email. You have it. As for the ones that got erased =
if the recorder is USB you might be able to use a file recovery program to =
unerase the files. Ive done that on accident with the camera and few other =
things to many times to count LOL and file recovery usually can access it l=
ike a harddrive and unerase them.

Misty, could I send you th=
e file "come to the fair.....someone said" ? I haven't uploaded it here bec=
ause it is so very low audio (sorta) but with your "water" filters you migh=
t have what is needed BEFORE it is amplified. I would like to send it as a =
WAV file so you can receive the most information. In wav format it is 511kb=
. I can hear it pretty good...but I am in question as to if the little girl=
 actually says "someone" OR "some woman" said. You can do any enhancements =
that you might think will bring out the audio. If you have time. Thanks. Ji=
