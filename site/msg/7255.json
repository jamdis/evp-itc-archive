Ryan and his team go behind bars to uncover\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; institution&#39;s paranormal past and present--current inmates and\n&gt; guards\n&gt; &gt; are reporting mysterious new sightings! For their biggest case yet\n&gt; PRS\n&gt; &gt; enlists the help of psychic Chip Coffey, demonologist Lorraine\n&gt; Warren\n&gt; &gt; and Chris Moon, the owner/inventor of the latest in paranormal\n&gt; &gt; technology, &quot;Frank&#39;s Box,&quot; a radio designed to communicate with the\n&gt; dead&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think they have their details a bit wrong. :-P\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nellie\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private &  \n&gt; confidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is  \n&gt; addressed to.\n&gt;\n&gt; No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or  \n&gt; forwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nA e you going o he ho se's head in he bed o he jus a good knee-capping? ;)AnnOn Feb 18, 2008, a 1:38 PM, juli elazquez w o e:Tha 's ok Nellie, I will be se ing he eco d s aigh p e y soon wi h he help o some dea iends.  Julipu plespace iend li e.com> w o e:I e-mailed hem--no esponse.
