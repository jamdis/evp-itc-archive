Here are a few I recorded\n&gt; with him during a different session.  In one of the clips you will hear\n&gt; someone from the other side call me a freak.  I picked this guy up over a\n&gt; month ago and he likes to hang around and call me freak whenever I do a\n&gt; session.  I find it pretty funny because he is so consistent; during this\n&gt; session he called me freak multiple times.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tim\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, Nov 19, 2010 at 12:20 PM, Frank Sumption &lt;\n&gt; purplealiengirl@...&lt;http://us.mc1110.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  [Attachment(s)&lt;http://us.mc1110.mail.yahoo.com/mc/welcome?.gx=1&.tm=1290194239&.rand=8d1npe0idra96#12c652777c0732c2_TopText&gt;from Frank Sumption included below]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nJe ome,I add essed his guy in a session a home on No embe 3 d when he popped up again.  In his clip (unadul e a ed so i s a li le as ), I ge a clea esponse om my ech as o who i is, ano he eak message om him, and a singing onal esponse om o he s.\nTimOn F i, No 19, 2010 a 2:25 PM, M anah Malo i inyanga4@...> w o e:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n Tim, \n \nI hink he's been hanging ou du ing ou eco dings la ely oo, lol. \n \nI' e been called a \" eak\" in a leas hal a dozen sessions I' e held o e he las 2-3 weeks.
