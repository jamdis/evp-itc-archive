Again its a case of prove or disprove it for  yourself. Not \n&gt; everyone comes to the same conclusions or gets the exact  same results. \n&gt; Maybe similar but not exact. \n&gt;  \n&gt; I tend to use a variety of methods. When voices come from things  such as \n&gt; water or out of thin air sometimes its a easier for some to  believe there is \n&gt; something there that they were not aware of.\n&gt; \n&gt; But again they have to prove it for themselves to be able to have  that eye \n&gt; opening moment.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I only comment on what I hear or dont hear. My speaker set up is a  bit \n&gt; different than most. I hate headphones. Others prefer them. Some use  pc \n&gt; speakers. Results vary based on the individual. What I hear you may  not then \n&gt; again you just might hear it exactly the same. I dont worry  about that. Just \n&gt; keep exploring with an open mind.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Misty\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 8/20/09, April Abercrombie  \n&gt; &lt;april@abercrombieghapril@abercrapr&gt;  wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From:  April Abercrombie  &lt;april@abercrombieghapril@abercrapr&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re:  [EVP-ITC] Re: I just want to say...\n&gt; To:  EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsTo: \n&gt; Date: Thursday, August 20, 2009, 10:01  AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; To be honest, I am still very  skeptical about the Frank&#39;s Box type of \n&gt; technology, as I have not  heard anything convincing enough for me personally to \n&gt; say  yeah-that is spirit communication.

As an example, some people believe in  angels and demons \n&gt; others do not. Therefor some may get messages that  correspond to their own \n&gt; beliefs as well as the beliefs of those who  are speaking.\n&gt; \n&gt; Almost every person who does this eventually  develops a theory that may \n&gt; change over time based on what they  experience and what their beliefs are. \n&gt; Then there are those who  remain undecided or have doubts.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for me I look at it as  purely educational, a learning experience. Ive \n&gt; met many people I  never knew existed. Ive researched topics I&#39;d never even \n&gt; considered.  Ive gotten messages and images that are awe inspiring and many  \n&gt; interesting concepts to ponder and explore.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many  glimpses of truth, as well as momentary proof along the way \n&gt; that  lead me to develop my own theory and eventually you will develop  \n&gt; your own too. This research is fascinating and can be quite mind  blowing.\n&gt; \n&gt; I dont worry what anyone else thinks. I have no need  to prove anything to \n&gt; anyone else. They can do that for themselves. I  always say honesty is the \n&gt; best policy and if you are honest with  yourself and others the only ones who \n&gt; object are those who&#39;s lies  arent tolerated. So just look for the truth \n&gt; yourself and dont let me  or anyone else tell you what that is. \n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a great journey  and your path is your own!\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroups  .com_ \n&gt; (http://us.mc329.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) , &quot;mrscaptainjack2&quot; &lt;jjkamp@&gt;  wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you, guys, but I just wanted to make  sure -- really sure. \n&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s hard on here to figure out which  post is replying to which!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So I&#39;ve been thinking  about this over and over -- I&#39;ve been able to \n&gt; think of little else  in the last few days -- trying to figure this out and make \n&gt; some sort  of reasonable theory I can live with. I know we will never have \n&gt; a  true answer, at least not any time soon, but surely those who have  been \n&gt; doing this for years and years must have a working theory on  what these \n&gt; entities are? Based on their behavior rather than what  they say? Based on \n&gt; consistencies from researcher to researcher?  Based on things these entities \n&gt; know and don&#39;t know (e.g. knew my  dad&#39;s friend Gordy was dead, while I did  \n&gt; not)?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
