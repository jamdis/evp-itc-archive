I had \na rather long talk with Ron after I heard an investigator tell me \nthey were thinking of handing over the Box to their teenager and \nallow the child and her friends to have an electronic Ouija pajama \nparty. Ron totally agreed with me that this is not the best method of \ntesting ala the change.\n\nLance\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;babiarz3&quot; &lt;babiarz3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Not misinformation. The page has been changed as of Dec 3rd! Imagine\n&gt; that. The article did indeed state that children and high school\n&gt; students would be part of the testing groups as well as skeptic,\n&gt; believers, etc. \n&gt; Yes I did notice the discrepancy between the asup article and the\n&gt; disclaimers on the paranormal sytems page. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well, so much for the &quot;Oh Noes!1!!

Do not allow children under the age of 16 to use this device\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Although individual sessions are effective, group sessions \nare more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; productive.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. This is not an &#39;electronic Ouija board&#39; - no harm can come \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; using it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Some voices will use coarse language so be prepared for it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Always use a recorder to tape all sessions\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Keep a notebook with the times and locations of your \nsessions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 7. The MiniBox will call you by name so don&#39;t be startled by it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lance\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
