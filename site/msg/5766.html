Hi Ralph   Welcome.  My parents and family live in and around Allentown, PA while I am living in Mexico with my wife and kids.   I am new to this group too and to the technology...what a great find for me.  Maybe I can meet up with you when I get to PA in June.   Ron L

I'm a new member of the group and I am an Investigator of the 
Paranormal here in central PA. My group's name is SPIRIT Paranormal 
Investigation Team. I have been doing this in groups now for 6 years.
I had my own group H.I.P.S. (Harrisburg Independent Paranormal 
Society) and now I am in the SPIRIT group out of Selinsgrove,PA. I 
also use to be with Kelly Weaver's group Capital Ghost Forum which is 
now called Spirit Society of PA. I had to leave her group because of 
my work schedule. I have been on Ghost Investigations with TAPS to 
Waverly Hills Sanatorium,Ky, Eastern State Pennitentiary in PA. I 
have 
also investigated St. Augustine Lighthouse in Fla. I did have a 
chance 
to meet Bill Murphy here in Gettysburg,PA. on the Battlefield near 
the 
Wheatfield last year for a short time. He is a nice guy. I let him 
listen to some of my EVP's from the Wheatfield and Triangular Field 
that day we met. I have been called an " EVP Medium " by my peers. I 
have a ton of them. I would like to thank "Frank Sumption" for his 
inspiring work with his boxes and giving of his time and knowledge to 
inspire us to do our own research to find the answers we are all 
looking for in this world. Thanks, Frank for your inspiration and 
hard 
work we all appreciate it. I would also like to thank "Sum Duck" 
and "Mike Coletta" for coming up with those Hacks that made it easy 
for me and all the others out there that are Electronically 
illiterate.
Thank you guys we all appreciate it too. Oh well I just wanted to put 
my two cents in to let you know I'm with you all. Oh, I have two 12-
469's the first one I broke trying to hack it LOL. The other one 
works 
great. I also have the 12-470(old model) which I tried to hack but I 
cut the wrong wire. I cut the green wire (seventh wire from the top 
as 
Mike said to do)and when I put everything back together I had no AM 
Band LOL. So I opened it up again and was thinking to myself should I 
cut the wire before the green one I had cut or should I cut the wire 
after the green one. Hmmmm, I thought here goes nothing so I cut the 
yellow wire after the green one number eight from the top. I put it 
together as I was crossing my fingers, I tried the FM band and bingo 
it worked great. Just a funny story of how electronically illiterate 
I 
am. I do want to say I do hear alot of voices coming across these 
boxes. I hear them saying their names and sometimes it sounds like 
they are talking to each other. I have gotten answers to questions 
too. Yesterday at my work place I like to listen to it while I'm 
working here at the Post Office. I heard a male voice say to me "Do 
you want a Tech ?" I also hear the name Lisa alot and they 
say "seven" 
alot too. My name has been called alot too. So there has to be 
something to these boxes. Oh I also had one say " Hurry dead battery "
which my batteries did die a few minutes later which was cool. I was 
recording with my voice recorder and picked that up. They say some 
funny things sometimes too. I did hear one say to me " F__k Off " I 
know that wasn't on any radio program LOl. Oh well you have a great 
set up here and it is nice to meet you all. Take care and keep up the 
great work you all are doing in your researches. Bye for now !!

Regards,

Ralph Smith of "SPIRIT" Paranormal Investigation Team !!!!
