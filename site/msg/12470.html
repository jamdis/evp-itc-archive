<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>So this guy that has been doing paranormal research since he was 11 is 
on a ghost investigation, and sees and appartion, which logically one 
would hope to see when hunting for such thing. So instead of gathering 
data, and observing, he runs out of the building screaming like a 
little girl. It&#x27;s friggin&#x27; Holywood B frikin&#x27; S! Lets all make it all 
scary so only the chosen few can make money, an get famous.
