I ran across\n&gt; this one and its\n&gt; funny and terrifying!!! So of course I had to share it with\n&gt; you guys LOL I\n&gt; dont think they use that kind of harness here its more like\n&gt; roller coaster\n&gt; ride style lockdown.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube.\n&gt; &lt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5NdZRb9rqI&feature=related&gt;\n&gt; com/watch?v=V5NdZRb9rqI&feature=related\n&gt; \n&gt; Gonna pass that one off to some friends they will enjoy it\n&gt; more than me LOL\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty"}
