I had a \nreally kick butt one that I sent to TAPs.  A little girl, clear as a \nbell but there was nothing I could do with it.  Hopefully TAPs can do \nsomething with it.\n\nNow, the file I put up, if you listen REALLY close when I ask a \nquestion there are tiny bell sounds right after the question.  I have \nanother almost 10 minute EVP where I left the recorder in the room, no \nwindows or doors open and when I went in to turn it off there was a \nvery strong scent of old fashioned tea rose.\n\nIf anyone could bump up the 2nd one to see what the low voices are \nsaying that would be great, drop me an e-mail.  I am a sensitive but \nwould love to learn how to also use some equiptment to help me out.\n\nThank you \n\nSaqqara"}
