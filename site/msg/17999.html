Since we're talking about experiments and protocols here are some ideas to =

improve
the protocol RJ suggested initially. Using a test target is one wa=
y of 
establishing a 

truth in time, which is the basis of this experiment=
. But there are a couple of 
issues.

It is quite possible that someone cou=
ld discern the target through remote 
viewing alone.
This would negate the =
need for involvement of a spirit communicator or 
discarnate entity.
Outcom=
es=A0depend on the word of those reporting. The true skeptic (not cynic) 
w=
ould 

therefore say that this experiment contains a basic flaw in that it=
=A0does not 
uniquely 

indicate that the information was obtained in the p=
rescribed manner. Providing 
access
to the raw audio file would not necessa=
rily constitute proof either, since many 
of these 

communications can onl=
y be heard by certain people, 

If the audio file were quite clear, timing=
=A0=A0becomes an issue. In other words, 
when was 

the audio actually reco=
rded?=A0 This issue can be mitigated simply by requiring 
any
claimant to e=
mail the audio file to a trusted party before the test ends. It 
would be b=
est 

if the trusted party were not otherwise invovled in the experiment an=
d it was=A0 
their duty 

simply to=A0collect the claims. Once all claims h=
ad been collected they could be 
posted 

publicly for review=A0by the comm=
unity in general.=A0 The experimenter could decide 
if any 

of the claims =
seemed to have hit,=A0and this decision could be reviewed by anyone 
if des=
ired. 


The important detail however is that this experiment does not comp=
letely answer 
the 

question. It is a first attempt and certainly can be i=
mproved on successive 
trials.

Successive trials are always a good idea, s=
ince it provides replication. And it 
would be
best if others replicated th=
e experiment using a very similar protocol. If these 
were to
succeed, the =
community could then state that out of X trials Y had succeeded (by 

some =
definition of success) potentially=A0giving a success rate above that 
expe=
cted 

by random chance. This would make the outcome quantifiable and measu=
reable 
and thus meaningful.

But also important to note, this would only p=
rove the potential veracity of the 
messages.
It would not (and cannot as f=
ar as I can tell) prove the origin of the messages. 
This detail
will, I fe=
ar, remain a matter for belief and speculation for quite some time to 
come=
.
