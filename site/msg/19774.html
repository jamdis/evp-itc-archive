&gt; I heard the French too, Tim.  Haven&#x27;t used French for years, but I think I heard at 41&quot;: &quot;... and you were by there&quot; (&quot;et vous etiez par la...&quot;) rather than &quot;...en vous etait parlons...&quot;.  At at 54&quot; right after Steve said &quot;this is my antenna&quot;, I heard in French &quot;Don&#x27;t leave!&quot; (&quot;Ne quitte pas!&quot;)  And when Steve switched to AM linear sweep at 1:28, I heard &quot;Who is this?&quot; (&quot;Qui est-ce?&quot;)
&gt; 
&gt; Good vid, Steve; thanks for sharing it.

&gt; &gt; Interesting.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do you speak French Steve?  A woman was speaking it during the clip starting
&gt; &gt; at .41 seconds.  Are there any French radio stations down that way?  What I
&gt; &gt; find interesting is that she is speaking French and man is agreeing with her
&gt; &gt; in English.  It may be radio broadcast because of the clarity, but I would
&gt; &gt; think a translator would be speaking for her since only the Bayou and Quebec
&gt; &gt; use French here in North America.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My French is really rusty, but I think she is saying:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &quot;D&#x27;accord.  En vous etait parlons a l&#x27;etre (yes)  te t&#x27;aller....&quot; and I
&gt; &gt; can&#x27;t quite make out the rest.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &quot;I agree.  What you are talking about is the being (yes).  You go....&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; When you switch to direct mode random at 4:13 you get a pretty clear female
&gt; &gt; &quot;hey.&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Looks like the camera was well worth the money!
