LOL  \n\nYesterday, I thought of your little Listen Up! audio amplifier with the \nY adapter, headphones and the recorder as an EVP recorder set-up for \nreal time audio EVP on investigations.  My plan is to suit-up one of my \nEVP specialists and test in the field within the next couple weeks.  \nPerhaps, they might be able to hear the replies as it is being \nrecorded, so they can then ask questions.  Interestingly enough, I just \nreceived an EVP over top of my ghost box sweeping audio on Friday.  \nWeird. However, I did not envision the chamber with &quot;prongs&quot;(?) like \nyou built, though.  \n\nLOL  Can&#39;t wait to hear about your results.\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; You know me and my weird devices... yes I&#39;ve built another.\n&gt; This one came to me in a dream last night.  I think it was because \nsome \n&gt; of you guys were talking about echo chambers.\n&gt; Anyway... when I woke up I went looking around the house for stuff to \n&gt; make this thing before I forgot what it looked like in my dream.\n&gt; I completed it but now I guess I must test it to see if it is what I \n&gt; think it is... an EVP Box, maybe???\n&gt; \n&gt; Read more and see a few pictures, here: http://www.ufogeek.com/?p=200\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt;"}
