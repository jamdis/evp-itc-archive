The same thing happens in video ITC, it&#39;s like \nthere is but a moment and we all better pay attention. -Bill\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ursula Bielski &lt;ursulabielski@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Willy, Really interested in listening to the new files.  I&#39;ll let \nyou know after.\n&gt;   Just to throw in regarding EVP maker and everything else but the \nboxes.  I used EVP maker and the water method AND foreign language \nbroadcast method and radio static and box fan, etc etc etc before I \ngot my shack hack and my Joe&#39;s box, and I must admit that I have put \neverything else aside even though I got good results with ALL of \nthose other methods.  There&#39;s just something very exciting about the \nboxes, I think, that makes us forsake all others.  When I started \nusing a hack, which Jeff Rezman made for me before I got the Joe&#39;s \nBox, I felt it was a nervous sort of experimentation--that is to say, \nthe loud, short, fast sound clips had me on edge, as I was used to \nquiet static and water, but I think now I&#39;m addicted to the sound and \nthe frenzy of it!  Does anyone else feel this way?\n&gt;   Ursula\n&gt; \n&gt; billliscomb williscomb@... wrote:\n&gt;           Ursula and Misty  thank you very much for your feedback. \nI \n&gt; really appreciate you taking the time to listen, and for the \n&gt; comments, especially noting the dual layers of speech. Interesting. \n&gt; Frank S. - Thanks for the recent files from EVPmaker - nice! \n&gt; There hasn&#39;t been much discussion regarding EVPmaker lately, so I \n&gt; wasn&#39;t&#39; sure if it was a viable tool to use. I haven&#39;t read many \n&gt; older posts, but hope to get caught up during the holidays. Have \nyou \n&gt; or others considered modifying speech synthesis software to \ngenerate \n&gt; random sounds? I wonder how something like that would work\n&gt; On the 16th I did three 3minute recordings and got 9 clips from \n&gt; them. In this session, I was asking questions regarding a knocking \n&gt; sound I heard while going to sleep or waking up about 12 years ago. \n&gt; My life situation wasn&#39;t the best at that time. It was always three \n&gt; knocks, and once a doorbell, but not the doorbell for where I was \n&gt; then living. Started the Knocking session by telling &quot;Rick&quot; that I \n&gt; got messages from previous session, got &quot;Well, he&#39;s got patience!&quot; \n&gt; for response. Then was told, &quot;Aye, it smells in here.&quot; Next asked \n&gt; them what sound did I hear back then, and got &quot;it was knocking \n(maybe \n&gt; nothing?)&quot; The best one so far is; &quot;Our earthbound forefathers are \n&gt; video programs.&quot; A second voice keeps repeating &quot;Ent&quot; syllable \n&gt; during this one. I have put these files in a new folder called \n&gt; Knocking, which is under Laptop MP3s. More comments there. \n&gt; I&#39;m making progress on getting the software needed to do \n&gt; linear scanning with the Radio Shark 2 USB am/fm radio and hope to \n&gt; have it up and running within the next week or two. \n&gt; Thanks again to all\n&gt; Willy\n&gt;"}
