Boy do I feel dumb reading about the terminology of Hacked Shacked and mini boxes.
   
  Are these just personal names for a Franks Box device, or do they exist? I have searched in Google for these, and find nothing.
   
  Id like to try what all of you are doing, but do not have a box/device.
   
  Does radio shack sell one?
   
  I have two old am/fm dial radios from the 1960's that work quite well. One is a WW radio that has AM/FM stations in addition to SW.  Can I use these, and can someone give me some pointers to help get me started?

the box--almost as if they need the energy of my voice, too. I'm
always starting a question and stopping because they're suddenly
coming through so loudly. Of course, when I stop, so do they... :(
