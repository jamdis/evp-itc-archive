Yep I can hear that Ann. Ive had that name come thru as well. Kinda strange coincidence as I was just sharing one of mine with someone new to this research as an example of people who come thru but I dont know them nor can confirm them other than what is said. On one they came thru saying something which I later compared to an old recording I was able to find online. They used same words he used to start his speech I was a little shocked when I heard it so I clipped it and made a side by side comparison.

  Heres the file if ya havent heard it yet.
