CHAPTER 13

THE VERY REAL DANGERS
(of Operating SPIRICOM-type equipment)

1. Dangers which could be encountered by individual researchers

Under no circumstances do we want to encourage any enthusiastic reader
or potential researcher to start out in this field without the
information in the next few paragraphs.

As was pointed out earlier, science now knows that everything in the
cosmos is one or more forms of energy in motion. Some energy is
beneficial to Man and some is harmful. X-rays for example, in small
and carefully controlled amounts, can be of great help to Man, but in
too great a concentration can destroy tissue, entire organs and even
the whole body. Ultra-violet light is highly beneficial to Man and
plants, but certain wavelengths of UV can kill not only bacteria, but
also plants and even people. (In 1978 in our laboratory in Ft. Myers,
Florida, we were experimenting photographically with different
wavelengths of UV light. After an exposure of only a few minutes at
one of the wavelengths we were using, all of our lovely 3-year-old ivy
plants and philodendron were killed and the green leaves became as
black as carbon.)

On the 11&quot; x 17&quot; diagram, &quot;In Our Father&#x27;s House There are Many
Mansions,&quot; please note near the left margin the vertical arrow which
reads, &quot;MATTER (Energy) at progressively HIGHER rates of vibrations or
frequencies.&quot; In this diagram the energies which make up the minerals
and water of the earth are at the bottom, (the lowest vibrational
level). Man and all other living creatures and life forms on the
surface of the earth are composed of bodies which contain essentially
the same minerals and water, but in addition, they have consciousness
which represents a higher rate of vibration.

The lowest astral planes shown in the above-mentioned diagram contain
persons who have shed their mineral and water bodies and exist as
their individual consciousness. Hence they are not suddenly allwise.
They know absolutely nothing of the &quot;worlds&quot; that exist above them.
They, for the most part, are truly &quot;lost&quot; and many do not even know
that they are dead! Many of them are desperate to get back into their
old physical body. Some of the poor souls are filled with the
strongest of physical lusts and desires for alcohol or other drugs.
They may make a serious effort to continue their indulgence by finding
some person whose energy field is enough like theirs that they can be
merged. This is the basis for obsession.

Although present-day psychiatry does not yet recognize it, we feel
reasonably certain that at least 25% of the patients in our mental
asylums are, in part, the victims of such unwanted intrusion into
their individual consciousness by entities on the lowest astral planes.

[We do not condemn psychiatry for this lack of understanding. It is
only in the last few years that Man has gained the understanding that
the mind is non-physical, that it is, in fact, an energy field, and
that it can, and in some cases does, occupy a body other than that for
which it was intended. Fortunately there is now a newly formed branch
of the psychiatric field know as Metapsychiatry Page 83 which is
increasingly making use of the latest scientific findings in this
area. And it is gratifying that in 1980 the American Psychiatric
Association added &quot;multiple personality&quot; to its diagnostic and
statistical manual of mental disorders!]

  back to Top of Page  

When any person starts to build equipment designed to &quot;talk to the
spirits&quot; it behooves him to carefully bypass all the persons now very
much alive in the lowest astral planes. (Incidentally, this area is
also populated with some rather frightening forms of life which do not
belong to the human line of evolution.)

In fact, it is not enough to just tune out the lowest astral planes.
There is another hazard to be encountered a little higher up. There is
a layer of spirits who are not really intending to be harmful and they
are not likely to lock into your aura. But they are out to have some
fun -- they are more like pranksters. Should you contact them, they
may pretend to be someone they are not. They may, as we say, &quot;take you
for a ride.&quot; They may appear much more knowledgable than they are.

It is because of these &quot;communication hazards&quot; that mediumship got
such a bad name 2,000 years ago. At the time of the events in the New
Testament, mediumship was very common. Its dangers were also well
known, because it was a rare medium indeed who could tap the wisdom of
the highest astral planes. Anyone who could tap that of the
mental-causal or the celestial planes went down in history as a
prophet, sage or seer! The writers of the New Testament cautioned
their small flocks to &quot;Beware&quot; and to &quot;Test&quot; all spirits with whom
contact was made, to make certain that the communicators were good,
friendly, God-fearing spirits.

How does an EVP or SPIRICOM researcher make certain that he does not
attract a cloud of undesirable spirit persons? There are two precautions:

First, never work in this field unless you are in excellent physical
health, free of serious mental or emotional stresses and strains, and
have an optimistic and joyful attitude about your life and toward all
with whom you come in contact . If you cannot honestly say that you
fit this physical, mental and emotional profile -- then find some
other outlet for your inquiring mind!

The second point requires a bit of background. You daily use your
radio and/or TV. When you want to switch from one station to another,
you turn a channel or station control knob. By so doing you turn from
one wavelength or frequency to another -- either higher or lower. A
SPIRICOM set operates the same way. But the
&quot;good&quot; SPIRICOM programs come in only on the higher wavelengths or
frequencies. Hence you should try to use a set which will get up
beyond the stations which have only the &quot;bad&quot; programs.

Unfortunately this is easier said than done. Most of the EVP research
has been done in kilohertz wavelengths. It is the consensus of the
researcher at Metascience Foundation that you will Page 84 never reach
the desired intelligence levels at these wavelengths. Even at a far
higher level -- 29.5 Megahertz - - we have on occasion, tuned in to
some very uncouth characters using language which was not fit for print.

In general we feel that, in the years ahead, researchers should
constantly strive to establish systems which will reach ever higher
frequencies. Our projections for Mark VI and Mark VII show how
seriously we ourselves take this bit of advice.

If you as a researcher have followed the above precautions, you may
very well reach individuals who are highly evolved in the best
spiritual sense. They are interested -- deeply and solely -- in
helping Man on earth to grow up out of the quagmire of hate, jealousy,
murder and materialism which he has fashioned for himself. If you want
to narrow the gap from where you individually stand in your own
spiritual development, and the level of spiritual growth which your
prospective communicators possess, you will find it helpful to include
one or two short periods of meditation and prayer in your daily schedule.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Does this prescription work? Yes, speaking from the personal
experiences of our associates during the past ten years. Are the
dangers real? Yes. Among the researchers in this field who failed to
follow the above warnings are at least one known suicide and two cases
of possession. Either suicide or possession is a high price to pay for
disregarding admonitions that have their basis in 2,000 years of history.*


2. Dangers which Mankind faces if SPIRICOM is not used wisely

Since his beginnings, Man has been faced with the fact that
individually and collectively he has the power to act for good or
evil. As his knowledge of the energetic nature of the cosmos has
expanded, Man has found that every energy so far identified -- from
sexual energy to atomic energy -- can be used for his benefit or for
his downfall. He will find that the energies involved in SPIRICOM are
also of a nature that can be used to help him grow mentally and
spiritually and become more God-like (that is more like the beings on
the higher planes) or they can be focused on trivia which will make it
even harder for him to grow out of the present deplorable mess in
which Western civilization&#x27;s social, economic and political actions
are tending toward disintegration.

----------------

    * For the spiritually oriented, we report some advice given by
high level spirit communicators: If SPIRICOM researchers adhere to the
following procedure they will not suffer possession by negative
forces. First thing in the morning say, &quot;I will wear the protective
cloak of the Christ light until I retire tonight.&quot; On retiring make a
similar decree for the night hours. (Note: The Christ light is said to
have overshadowed and inspired Jesus of Nazareth continually during
the last three years of his earth life.)

Page 85
When SPIRICOM instrumentation is further perfected, it will in the
very nature of product development, be more simplified and available
at lower and lower cost. (Already we discern the possibility of making
equipment to do the work of Mark IV, for example, in the form of a
relatively inexpensive, compact, hand-held instrument.) Will such
equipment be used to the maximum benefit of people -- both here and in
the hereafter?

To the extent that it will reduce the sense of loss and grief at the
passing of a loved one, it will be of great value. To the extent that
it helps people learn that what we have called &quot;death&quot; is in fact,
&quot;birth&quot; into another and potentially more glorious life, it will also
be a great blessing. To the extent that it is used for the purpose of
convincing a large portion of the 4,000,000,000 persons now on earth
that they should live this life in ways that will assure the best
conditions for their next life, it could be tremendous factor in the
upward evolution of Man.

But, sad to say, there is another side to the coin if contact is with
only the lower planes. Consider these two omens of why widespread use
of SPIRICOM may not suddenly make Man into a new and noble creature.

First consider the parallel to what has happened in the last 100 years
in the case of those persons who became deeply interested in all forms
of psychic phenomena and concentrated in groups to develop their
members into good mediums. The mediums brought through many messages
which gave seeming evidence of survival. Such messages brought great
comfort to many of the sitters. A few of the messages conveyed great
spiritual truths and tried to show the wisdom of inculcating such
truths into the daily lives of the sitters. A new religion called
Spiritualism took roots in England, the USA and many other countries.
A variant called Spiritism took roots and grew in France, Brazil and
other countries. There were many who thought that this new religion
would sweep the world. It has not done so. Why?

The answer has been provided during the last few years from
Spiritualists now living on the higher planes. From their higher
perspective (and speaking through the remarkable direct-voice
mediumship of Leslie Flint) Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir
William Barrett, Emma Harding Britten, Ellen Terry and Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle have said time and again, with great sadness,
&quot;Spiritualism has lost its spirituality! It has concerned itself with
trivia.&quot;

They refer to the fact that Spiritualism (unlike Spiritism in Brazil)
still concentrates on platform clairvoyance and mediumship which is in
contact with only the lower astral planes. The messages brought
through are primarily of a personal greeting type and very seldom
contain any spiritually-oriented teachings from the
higher levels of wisdom.

If SPIRICOM is used in the decades ahead primarily to contact loved
ones who have recently passed to the lower planes, it will have fallen
into the same trap of being concerned only with trivia. Those living
on the lower planes are basically no more evolved and enlightened than
they were when they passed over. In the main, they did not produce a
viable civilization when they were running the show here on the
surface of the earth!

Page 86
Only if Man is inventive enough to perfect forms of SPIRICOM which can
communicate with the higher planes,  can he tap the desired level of
wisdom and spiritual enlightenment. And only if he then has the wisdom
to use the devices for tapping that wisdom and enlightenment can he
create heaven on earth. Will SPIRICOM users concern themselves only
with trivia, or with the wisdom that could lead Man into the
long-promised &quot;golden age&quot;?

And now let us look at the second reason why we should not expect that
SPIRICOM will necessarily achieve the goal of making Man into a new
and better creature. Let us take a strictly objective view of what has
happened to the rosy-hued dreams of the miracles predicted to follow
perfection of TV, motion pictures and radio broadcasting.

The following clipping was saved about 1975 from an electronics
magazine (author unknown) because of its pertinence to the situation
that would exist when someday we, or others, succeeded in developing
SPIRICOM.

    We should recognize that new technology readily evokes rosy
expectations. Possible blessings are more easily glimpsed than
problems, and are more gratifying to contemplate. As we have seen,
visions of the wired world have been with us ever since the invention
of the telephone. As early as 1882, an artist pictured a woman
shopping via television, and another taking a course via television.
In the early 1900s, the motion picture was expected to have many of
the same effects predicted for telecommunications-wide dispersal of
knowledge, equalization of opportunity, strengthening of democracy and
of international understanding. Broadcasting, at the very hour of its
birth, was expected to have similar effects. The first issue of Radio
Broadcast, launched early in 1922, predicted that broadcasting would ...
    ... elicit a new national loyalty and produce a more contented
citizenry ...
    ... the government will be a living thing to its citizens instead
of an abstract and unseen force ...
    ... at last we may have covenants literally openly arrived at ...
    ... elected representatives will not be able to evade their
responsibility to those constituents who put them in office ...
    ... the people&#x27;s University of the Air will have a greater student
body than all the rest of our universities put together ...

    That same year a former Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels,
joined in the sanguine predictions: &quot;Nobody now fears that a Japanese
Beet could deal an unexpected blow on our Pacific possessions ...
Radio makes surprises impossible.&quot; Magazine articles of the day
featured such titles as &quot;How Radio is Remaking the WorId&quot; and &quot;Radio,
the modern Peace Dove&quot; and &quot;Ether Waves vs. Crime Waves.&quot;

Can anyone deny that Man has failed to reap all of the early
expectations for these remarkable technical developments? Can he deny
that the increasing flood of pornographic movies and video cassettes
may add to the rapid destruction of family life which has been the
backbone of our civilization? Can he deny that there is any
relationship between our spiraling crime rate and the exposure of our
children to 15 years of murder, rape and other crime on our TV and
movie screens?

Will Man similarly pervert the use of SPIRICOM? Any serious student of
human is compelled to answer &quot;yes.&quot;

  back to Top of Page  

However, there is one factor present in 1982 that did not exist while
the commercialization of radio, movies and TV was occurring. Our
communicators from the higher realms of Spirit have the ability to
look in a dispassioned way at miniscule Man in his many senseless
pursuit on the surface of the earth. They Page 87 have the wisdom
which comes from their knowledge of the workings of the cosmos. They
look at this small planet and are able to forsee the catastrophe which
is soon to engulf our present civilization. Their precognitive
statements are now coming into print in many nations. They predict
that Man has passed the point-of-no-return and that our economy, our
life styles, our political systems and our belief systems will undergo
changes far beyond the scope which most persons can conceive.

In the Summer 1979 the Metascience Foundation publication COLLAPSE &amp;
COMEBACK presented Riley Hansard Crabb&#x27;s highly informative study of
the zodiacal and planetary cycles. One of Mr. Crabb&#x27;s most useful
diagrams is reproduced herewith. Notice the pivotal time in which we
are living.

Page 88

Page 89

The far-reaching implications of the cosmic forces depicted in Crabb&#x27;s
diagram evoke serious questions in our minds -- as do the predictions
from higher planes regarding impending cataclysmic chanqes:

Could it be that God, the powers above, the good guys upstairs, people
on plane 6 and 7 of the &quot;Many Mansions&quot; chart --  whoever runs the
show -- have for 70 years intentionally slowed and frustrated efforts
of brilliant inventors such as Marconi, Tesla and Edison to create a
SPIRICOM?

Could it be that in their infinite wisdom the higher beings decided to
prevent the negative uses of SPIRICOM by not allowing its perfection
until Man is so desperate, so frustrated, so cast down, that he will
use it constructively to reach up to the higher planes, join forces
with the God each of us carries within, and together build a new
heaven and new earth?

Yes, SPIRICOM obviously has dangers for materialistic Man. But it may
also be the greatest single force for  helping to erect the new heaven
and to people the new earth which will follow the cataclysmic changes
which we will all be aparty to in this present decade -- and which
will even begin to hit us hard in 1982 and 1983.

With the above closing thoughts, the reader has a better perspective
for considering the:

   

Objectives of METASCIENCE FOUNDATION

To provide a scientific basis for knowing:

    *

      That life is eternal,
    *

      That each person is a son or daughter of God, the Father, the
Universal Mind, the Creator of all that exists,
    *

      That the life of each person is of infinite importance and has
specific purpose and ultimate meaning, and
    *

      That limitless love of neighbor und self leads to inner peace,
happiness and good health. 

We believe Man can achieve this profound level of understanding by
directly contacting the accumulated wisdom of the ages, currently
available on the Mental and Causal Planes. It is our conviction that
the most reliable access to this information can be provided by
perfecting a dependable two-way electromagnetic - etheric
communication system.

This would at last make possible a workable and rewarding cooperation
between Man&#x27;s many religions and his sciences.</pre>
