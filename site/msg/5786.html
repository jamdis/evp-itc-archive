<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, as soon as Sum put the hack out there it seems like there are 
many radios that could have the potential for ghost box 
functionality.  If it has a scan feature, it has potential to be 
hacked or in this case no hack involved.  If people do not want to 
hold the scan button down, you can use an old clothes line pin to 
hold it down for you.  I asked our friends on the other side if my 
new job was to find hackable radios and they said &quot;yes&quot; loud and 
clear.  The first time i asked what my job was months ago they 
answered &quot;To Teach Others&quot;.  These ideas just keep hitting me and 
they are so simple anyone could figure these out.  Maybe we were 
looking for harder solutions to the idea of a &quot;ghost box&quot;.  It seems 
simple ideas have taken the lead thanx to Sum for getting the idea 
out there and ball rolling on this one.

&gt; LOL!

&gt; I have had that radio on my night stand for years.  I listen to 
COast 
&gt; to Coast AM on it at night as I fall asleep and never tried the 
&gt; scan.  Figures...;)

&gt; &gt; I have always used this Sony Walkman the past several years to 
&gt; bring 
&gt; &gt; to the ball game with me and it&#x27;s by far the best sounding radio 
&gt; i&#x27;ve 
&gt; &gt; ever had.  Well, i was cleaning up today and came across it.  I 
&gt; &gt; turned it on and just held down the scan button and it scans 
&gt; through 
&gt; &gt; all the stations non-stop as long as you keep it pressed down.  
&gt; Which 
&gt; &gt; is no big deal since the recorded sessions for me are only 
usually 
&gt; 10 
&gt; &gt; Min. tops. This model has been out for years and you can pick it 
up 
&gt; &gt; at your local Circuit city or Best buy, it&#x27;s even on Ebay for 
$20.  
&gt; &gt; Circuit city i think is like $30.  You have to plug headphones 
into 
&gt; &gt; it or an external speaker, but it fits in the palm of your hand 
and 
&gt; &gt; the reception is better than all the rest.  It runs off of 1 AAA 
&gt; &gt; battery and lasts forever.  For those who are afraid to hack a 
&gt; radio, 
&gt; &gt; just pick this model up and hold the scan button down and away 
you 
&gt; go 
&gt; &gt; right out of the packaging.  I did open it up and there is a 
&gt; ribbon, 
&gt; &gt; but nothing was clearly marked so i will have to find the 
&gt; schematics 
&gt; &gt; online before i mess with it.  The radio has AM/FM/WB/TV, however 
&gt; &gt; when i did the trial scans i found that the AM worked best and 
&gt; &gt; instantly received answers to my questions.  I turned it on and 
&gt; asked 
&gt; &gt; if this is working and loud and clear they said &quot;yes&quot;.  Oh, it&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; model # SRF-M37V.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ll post more when the ideas hit me.
