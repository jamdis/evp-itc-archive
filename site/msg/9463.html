Everyone,
 
 
This took place about a year ago the guy stole my images fro=
m IAH and put up this page in one day.
He was immediately put down and disc=
redited and never surfaced again.
The images where there for everyone to sc=
rutinize and they were posted on almost a daily basis for a while.
It's lik=
e anything else in the paranormal, there will always be self appointed so c=
alled seekers of truth.
 
If you notice mine is the only item on the whole =
site. I don't mind sceptics or questioning about how I got these images 
bu=
t this guy was an idiot. If he just would have asked, I would have explaine=
d what process I went through to bring 
the images out of the glare of the =
sunlight. As a matter of fact I had done a whole step by step instruction p=
age on my previous website about the process. This creep was a self proclai=
med photoshop expert and claimed my images were touched up.
So I gave him a=
 raw image of mine and asked him to come up with the same result. That was =
the last I heard from him.
 
I did not put these images up to have to defen=
d them, I just thought because of the interest that arose regarding Margare=
t's images 
reminded me of my itc days, which are now long gone. My only in=
terest is box research.
 
I don't feel it was necessary to did up that idio=
ts website and post the link with my IAH gallery, I did not post these pict=
ures 
to prove anything just for curiosity sake.
