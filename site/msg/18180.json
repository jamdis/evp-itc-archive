One theory is that the human operator can be\n&gt; influenced\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by things they already know or suspect, and so interpret audio with\n&gt; their\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; own personal &#39;educated guesses&#39;, that would differ from what they\n&gt; would hear\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had they not known those things. This side experiment did indicate\n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; support for that theory, since before I mentioned &#39;articles of\n&gt; clothing&#39;, no\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one included an article of clothing in their results. But after I\n&gt; mentioned\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it, several reports of clothing began to appear. I did not add\n&gt; these tries\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the results above.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement,\n&gt; let me\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know.
