So far all of my disembodied experiences were while I was &quot;unconcious&quot; with little to verify any of the experiences as being anything but a dream state. However lately I have begun to do something again that I havent done since I was a small child. \n   \n  You know how it is when you wake up in the morning hit the snooze button, roll over and lay there thinking..... man I dont want to get up right now I am soooo comfortable. Well lets just say I do that alot even tho I usually get up before the next alarm hits in a few minutes I still press it, roll over and lay there for a minute LOL. Some people hit the coffee machine.. i hit the snooze.\n   \n  However, lately I am rolling over, but the body seems to stay still turned the other way. I used to do it often when I was a kid I would wake up in a totally different position than I thought I was laying in when I had my eyes closed. I&#39;d think I was layin on my stomache and realize I was flat on my back or on my side. With gravity its pretty easy to feel which end is facing down and once I am fully alert its a little disorientating at first. I am curious if anybody else has that experience, including those who travel out of body at will.\n   \n  Misty\n\n       \n---------------------------------\nLuggage? GPS?
