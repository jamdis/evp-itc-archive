You and your \nwork are the reason I became interested in this subject.  Please \nreconsider after some time to relax and think about it.\nPeople respect you and enjoy your company and words of wisdom. It is \nFrank Sumption and Frank&#39;s Boxes that are the ones known around the \nworld.\nPLEASE remain here with us, and continue to participate and work on \nyour fantastic projects!!!\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  After a long discussion, and at times a yelling match with Chris \nMoon on the phone...I have like zero memory for verbal stuff, \nbasically I think it came down to he said-she said type deal. I could \nagree with some of what Mr Moon said, but the bottom line is--I don&#39;t \ncare! I have had enough of these endless pissing contests, one person \ntelling me one thing, someone else telling me something else. I&#39;m not \nwise enough to tell who is telling the truth. I&#39;m done, I&#39;m not \ndiscussing this stuff anymore, I&#39;m not making boxes anymore. I have \nabsolutely no interest in the so called paranormal. I don&#39;t sell this \nshit, I don&#39;t make any money, all it does eat all my time and piss me \noff. I&#39;ll finish this last box I&#39;m working on, and that&#39;s it. No more \ne-mails, no more discussion--I have had it!\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Mr Moon said he would be glad to come on the group and answer \nquestion--so there ya go, now is your chance. I&#39;m not going to be the \ngo between, nor will I participate. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Don&#39;t get caught with egg on your face.
