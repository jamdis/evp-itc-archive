I was a teenager\nwhen it happened. I was at my grandmothers house when I saw a soft\ngreen like glow illuminating one of the rooms in the hall in the\nmiddle of the night. It was a very soft glow but enough to catch my\nattention. I thought someone had left on a TV or that something was\nflashing in the room like a clock radio but as I went to investigate\nthe room the light stopped glowing and I never saw it again. \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Andrea Carr&quot; &lt;fairlia@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am Andrea Carr who is a 41 year old wife and mom of 1 daughter. I\nam sorry I have not written before but I have a terrible year and\nhaven&#39;t had the time to concentrate on EVP like I had prior. I won&#39;t\nget into the details but it has left me in the midst of OK just trying\nto pull through all of this BS & I will get back to it when I can.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunatley I am leaving for the weekend tomorrow morning and\nwon&#39;t see my e-mails until Monday morning. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have a question for any one here. I believe in aliens, spirit and\nghost communications via evp but tonight I had an experience I never\nhad before.\n&gt; \n&gt; I woke up at exactly 2:22 by my stove&#39;s clock and went and cleaned\nmy sink of dishes while I heated up some cream chipped beef (albiet\nnot too exciting) but while I sat there after in the dark with my\nfamily sleeping my hallway ilummating a light clored blue several\ntimes. Anyone else ever seen this?\n&gt; \n&gt; I look forward to any responses.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Andrea\n&gt;"}
