<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think just about every researcher can expect others to continue the
research. I believe in giving credit where credit is due, but I&#x27;d be a fool
to believe that no one else had anything good to contribute. People are
going to try their own experiments with the boxes. They may or may not find
some surprising things. That remains to be seen. But I would never squelch
others&#x27; research.

I don&#x27;t think everyone wants to use them for paranormal investigation
(ghost hunting) &quot;in the dark&quot; and not all paranormal investigators are
doing it to be scared. I don&#x27;t scare easily and fear is the last thing on
my mind in an investigation. Also, I do not believe everyone is out to
steal your claim to fame as the early researcher of the box. But realize
there may be a few who have something useful to contribute and we may yet
learn something from their work.

&gt; As others have said, i never post over here but do read it. I am disgusted
&gt; at the recent posts lately.. and not just because Steve is my brother..
&gt;
&gt; The rants, name calling, and vulgarity that comes from you Frank is
&gt; appalling. It seems to me that anyone that tries to do anything as far as
&gt; making a box is shot down and no one knows what they are doing other than
&gt; you.. I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would bother with you at all.. You seem to
&gt; be the angriest person i have ever seen.. Not to mention, having one sided
&gt; arguments.. I have been watching for days since you have thrown steve off
&gt; the group and your rants toward him calling him every name in the book go
&gt; unanswered..
&gt;
&gt; Feel free to throw me off as well.. I won&#x27;t post here again.. Whatever is
&gt; written on this board that you created shows no promise in anything
&gt; paranormal.. Negativity will never get you anywhere.. Paranormal unity is
&gt; about working together, not tearing everyone apart.. I have no respect for
&gt; you, as inventor of the box or not.. Doesn&#x27;t matter.. You have to give
&gt; respect to get it..
