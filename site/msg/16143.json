I find the subject fascinating, but my tecnnical skills are so limited I rarely feel like I can contribute anything to the group.  This post touched me so deeply, though, I felt I had to reply.\n\n     I have lost a number of well loved animal companions over the years, from Black Labs to White Ferrets to cats of various persuasions.  (The most recent being a tawny colored short-hair named O&#39;Rafferty, who looked like a pigmy puma.)  \n\n     While I have little experience with animal EVP&#39;s, I have no doubt that I will see them all again someday.  If they are not waiting for me on the other side, I&#39;m not going...\n\n     Would love to see posts from anyone that has experience with animal EVP&#39;s or other proof of companion animal survival.  Do those on the other side have anything to say about this subject?\n\n     I deeply sympathise with your loss...   Just reading your post brought tears to my eyes.\n\nNightshade\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt;   File        : /Jim&#39;s RR-DR60 EVP&#39;s/I_dont_know-evp.mp3 \n&gt;   Uploaded by : clockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt; \n&gt;   Description : My Cat (my best friend) was DOA to the Animal Rescue Leage here in town. IHe was missing for 4 days and on Friday I went to the pound and found that he had been struck by a car (the first night he didn&#39;t come home). Severe spinal injury and they had to give him the shot. I asked about him (on the other side)...well seems like they don&#39;t have the answers either. Glad tjey heard me though.....maybe he does too. Gonna miss him. \n&gt; \n&gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jim%27s%20RR-DR60%20EVP%27s/I_dont_know-evp.mp3 \n&gt; \n&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/general.htmlfiles\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; clockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt;\n&gt;"}
