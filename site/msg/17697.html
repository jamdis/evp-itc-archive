You can never defend one point by leaping to another or trying to change th=

The problem remain there, never changing.=
=C2=A0 Address that problem, fix it and move on.=C2=A0 But there is the pro=
blem.=C2=A0 You can't address that problem.

Is this a thing of Science?=C2=

out people out to get you and your box, hear me out.=C2=A0 Fact is, no one =
is out to get you Frank or your box.=C2=A0 We just have a problem with the =
basic theory and idea.

If you want to call this a religion, or something o=

religion, and trust me many people put faith in some strange shit LOL=C2=A0=

our box is no longer a thing of analytical discussion or debate.=C2=A0 It i=

Look at it this way, at least you could be tax exempt. :-)
