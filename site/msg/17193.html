<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The guy on the home page was gotten by sweeping a VCR tuner, similar to
using a radio for a box, then video recording the screen of a TV monitor. It
wasn&#x27;t the video loop most use, and I&#x27;ve never tried.

&gt; Hello everybody!
&gt;
&gt; First, let me say I am new here, and I really love this group.
&gt;
&gt; I have just started trying to capture images on my TV using a camcorder. I
&gt; have had some luck, but my pictures do not look like the guy on the home
&gt; page here. Lol. I think I am not getting the video loop to work, and am just
&gt; taking a picture of the noise on the screen. I have tried to manually focus
&gt; in and out as far as I can go, and I still don&#x27;t seem to have the right
&gt; focus to create the loop. Any ideas on how to achieve this loop would be
&gt; greatly appreciated. (I have tried to find more info on the web about this
&gt; and I have yet to come up with an answer.)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks so much!
