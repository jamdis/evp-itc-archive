<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ahh ok yeah I remember you saying it was at your sisters for that 
file. Usually I record in my bedroom office unless I am doing other 
methods. 

I think most of us go thru periods of adjustment or different 
perception. Perhaps over time we get better, they get clearer, and 
equipment changes to suit our needs.

You are off to a good start, you can hear them, and you record with 
the right intent. That in iteself should attract a few more to speak 
with you.

&gt; Misty,
&gt;    
&gt;   nope, I used water noise only one time ( i had no choice, i was 
investigating my sisters house and she has two aquariums with water 
filter noise)
&gt;   the rest of my evps i do at home with no background noise.
&gt;   I know what you mean about slowing down evp files. For the first 
year and a half i got evps that mostly had to be slowed down a great 
deal. I had problems with software and ended up not working with 
files that had to be slowed down.
&gt;   Perhaps the spirits I talk to realised they better speak slowly 
for me to hear them! lol I still do get evps that are very fast but 
have cleaer ones to keep me busy...lol
&gt;   where do you do your recordings?

&gt;    
&gt;   You still recording with the water in the background? Many seem 
to enjoy using water to form the voice and your setup is close to my 
h2o background noise. I tend to test alot of methods, some they 
approve of some they complain about but with water they never 
complain about the method. 
&gt;    
&gt;   I noticed a big difference between your files and mine tho, most 
of my voices stick to that supersonic speed level so ya have to slow 
it down -74 to hear them normal speed but most of yours are contained 
in normal rate of speed playback. I find it all interesting =)

&gt;         Hi Kristin!
&gt;   thanks for your reply about my evp uploads...
&gt;   I am capturing these files on my hand-held Sony digital IC 
recorder. it has an internal mic and i download my files into digital 
voice editor, then audacity to cut them down, then put them thru 
clear voice denoiser to remove background noise ( what a gem of a 
program that is!)
&gt;   I have been catching these evps in my home, and am not sure 
really &#x27;who &#x27; peter and monique are ( as i have never known anyone by 
these names) but when i spoke to them today they had quite a bit to 
say, among which was that they have been with me 17 years. I asked 
them if they were a&#x27;&#x27;couple&#x27; and monique said &#x27;yes we are&#x27;and peter 
said &#x27;no we&#x27;re not&#x27; so i guess they are having a bit of fun with 
me.  ;)
&gt;   Im not sure what you mean by a hack, ( i do know what you mean 
by &#x27;box&#x27;--like franks box or a spiricom- which no- i use neither of 
these things) however a good friend of mine is coming over tongiht 
and i plan to try and fandangle him into building me a spiricom 
device...... *crossing fingers* lol! 
&gt;   I have been doing evps about 3 years now and just the other day i 
found several that Peter and Monique identify themselves by name- and 
they were with me when i lived in a different house 3 years ago... so 
when I heard them again on my recorder recently- i thought i would 
try and see just how much info they can share with me.. I have gotten 
LOTS of evps from other ppl in this house i am in now as well. The 
vast majority are kind- but there is someone who is either a low-
level entity or isnt very evolved who leaves me the odd nasty 
statement....
&gt;   Every house i have lived in has been very &#x27;active &#x27; so I finally 
decided to try and find out more abou them.
&gt;   Have you been doing evps very long? do you have a haunt in your 
house? I will have to look and see what files you have in the group ( 
ive listened to almost all of them but forget whos is whos now lol)
&gt;   what brought you into the field of paranormal research?
&gt;   anyway, thanks again and look forward to chatting again soon
&gt;   cheers   :)

&gt;           Hi Charm!
&gt;   
&gt;   I&#x27;ve been listening to your files and they are very intriguing.  
Are these standard EVPs from an intelligent haunt of your own house?  
Are you utilizing a hack or any other type of box to capture these?
