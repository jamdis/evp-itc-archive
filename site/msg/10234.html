<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Stefan. Yes for some things we obviously need/want to post as 
larger formats thats why I suggested people try esnips or another 
file sharing service. It&#x27;s just gotten to the point of no choice but 
do something different than how we previously have done it before. 
Every little bit helps =)

&gt; Hi Misty,
&gt; 
&gt; if possible, I post all my audio files in the MP3 format. However, 
some files that include cue lists must be stored in the WAV format 
for technical reasons. If that&#x27;s a problem, I can upload my files to 
my own webspace rather than to the group&#x27;s Files section, and only 
post the links.
&gt; 
&gt; Stefan :)
&gt; 
&gt; -- 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hello all. It&#x27;s that time again for me to remind you that the 
group 
&gt; &gt; is low on space (96% used) and actions will be taken. For now 
rather 
&gt; &gt; than delete everyones files I am asking that you convert your wav 
&gt; &gt; format into mp3 or smaller format before you post them to the 
files 
&gt; &gt; area.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; One member using 10+ megs out of our groups 100 total megs just 
isnt 
&gt; &gt; going to fly anymore. So starting in May all files that are not 
&gt; &gt; within size limits and arent in smallest formats will have to 
start 
&gt; &gt; to get deleted.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For those who cant convert your files I have programs that are 
free 
&gt; &gt; to help you do that. For those that dont want to convert your 
files, 
&gt; &gt; you can use esnips to post your larger files and share them with 
the 
&gt; &gt; group as links in posts. For those that ignore my posts and do 
what 
&gt; &gt; you want to anyway, your stuff will be deleted and your option to 
&gt; &gt; upload and share here in group will be disabled.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As I said we have 100 (one hundred) megs total in file section 
for 
&gt; &gt; sharing, please do not abuse your share of that space. As you can 
see 
&gt; &gt; there are others who like to share too. Eventually we may just 
clean 
&gt; &gt; it out of everyones files but for now lets try and stick to 
&gt; &gt; compacting the things we upload and make use of places like 
esnips 
&gt; &gt; for sharing.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Misty
