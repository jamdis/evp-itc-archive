<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I had posted this elsewhere, but thought I should post it here for 
group fodder.  The uploaded preceding files were from a new spirit box 
I am testing that scans to strong signals only on the FM band, with 
scan rate and range adjustments.  This method is different sounding, 
being somewhat choppy, but may yield clearer audio.  The downside, as I 
have been discussing elsewhere, may be the lack of weaker signals 
between, and less white noise to be utilized.  I&#x27;ll keep working with 
it and post my results as I have them.  If spirits can manipulate 
audio, then this method may have merit, too. ;)
