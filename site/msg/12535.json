The first VME was recorded six years ago.  He \nrecently began speaking with her again and is getting the same type \nof phonemena when she leaves a voice mail message.  His phone and \nvoice mail service is through SBC Ameritech in MI.  The VME Service \nis of course digital.  The messages sound like breathy echoing  \nwhispers that say &quot;hey, hey, hiiiiiiiiii&quot;.  The hi is rather long and \ndrawn out.\n\nMy next client is receiving voice mail messages that are static \nfilled and also echo.  The voice messages all say the same thing &quot;You \nknow where my mother is, I want to talk to my mother&quot;.  The messages \ncome from homes in New Haven MI, and TX.  Regardless of the number \nthe message is the same.  Three of the numbers in MI are no longer in \nservice, the TX number is apparently a fax number.  The other phone \nnumbers come from homes bordering a cemetery located in New Haven \nMI.  My team has spoken with all of the residents.  They do not know \nthe client nor does my client know them.\n\nI have been told by one of my tech team members that phone calls can \nbe made via internet and there is a way to make it look like the \ncalls are coming from a different location.\n\nI welcome any input any of you might have as far as EVP&#39;s in this \narea!!\n\nThank-you\nSuzanne May\nMI Metro Paranormal Society"}
