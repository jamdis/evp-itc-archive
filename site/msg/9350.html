Just got in to read my email.  Maybe I missed something but in this email a few days ago from Bruce he talked about Air People messages and was looking for a response from others.  I kind of like that description of us.  We are Air People cause we breath air...and they...not.  Someone also mentioned Air Heads but I don't know who they were referring to.  LOL  Ron L

Hi guy's,

I got this message from a session with the new EVPM file yesterday.
It's a pretty long message and in it I believe they are asking for us 
to answer questions for them and not only ask questions.

Listening to this message and others I have received over the past 
week and a half, has leading me to believe that the reference to air 
people means US! It stands to reason (we are the air breathing people)
they are in spirit and we refer to them as such. So I am beginning to 
think their reference to us is air people. 

Where the speculation earlier in the experiments was that the mention 
of air people meant themselves because they where not solid physical 
bodies. but made of spirit.

Just something to chew on, and give us a research related topic to 
discuss.

When you listen to the file especially for you new people please read 
the description as the message is rather long and may be hard for new 
people that are not accustomed to listening to this type of file may 
have trouble keeping up.

let me know your take on what the reference to air people is in this 
message. and then I will post my interpretation.

Bruce
