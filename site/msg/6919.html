Frank R.

 

Maybe a bad choice of words, used to express what my thoughts where.

When I say higher being, my meaning is a spirit being on a higher plane of spiritual existence.

not beings that lord over us as if they are royalty and we subjects. 

 

My theory of why they will not give any detailed information about their physical experience on earth

is that they want our trust as colleagues in a spiritual sense. just suppose Mike gave me his sir name and where he was from.

when in the physical, say I used that information to trace his history as a physical human being. And found that he was a 

congressman or senator or supreme court judge. Someone that was distinguished and held a position of high respect and standing.

Or on the other side of the coin, I found that he was a murderer and a rapist that had been executed.

 

We as physical human beings would pass judgement on his former physical character and treat him or his guidance accordingly.

I believe just the opposite of what you referred I believe that is the reason we do not get the detailed information, so that we 

start on a level playing field and form a relationship according to experience we have interacting as spirit and physical counterparts.

Bruce,

It has always been my understanding that they do not like being referred to as higher or superior. They only refer to themselves as having different experiences. To be superior means to have authority over you, which they do not possess. Don't make the mistake of believing they are superior it can lead to some bad experiences. Just an observation on my part!

Regards,

Frank R.

Ralph,
 
Mike and lisa have been my tech's since I have started doing box research.
 
Over time you build a relationship with your tech or in my case tech's like you would 
with a new friend here in the physical.
 
Early on in my research I had asked a series of questions pertaining to mike and Lisa's background in the 
physical. I was told that mike died in 1995 from excessive blood loss and lisa died in 1912 from choking.
 
they then changed the subject and never broached it again. My theory on the reason for this is that
a spirit contact wants to remain in our thoughts and emotions as a higher being to develop a certain ammount of trust
being sight unseen. So to give us all the details of there physical life or even their last name, that could allow us to
gather information on who they where while in the physical and that in our minds would put them on an even level with us.
 
So the thoughts and feelings of there being superior spiritual entities would fade.
 
Bruce

Hi everyone,

I have been hearing the word " Purple " alot lately in my sessions.
Does anyone in the group know what it pertains to ? It's been bugging 
me alot. Could that be a special group on their side ? I have no clue. 
Also has anyone questioned the voices if they have a last name ? All I 
hear on the RS boxes are first names and haven't recieved anyone 
telling me their last name. Does Mike and Lisa have a last name ? Did 
anyone here ever ask the question " Are you Demonic Spirits ? " What 
was their reply if any ? I did one time and got a response saying " 
All of us are ". Don't know whether I believe that Spirit or not. 
Probably a Joker saying that. I have asked for specific people for 
them to find so I could talk to and got an answer " We're looking. " 
Then I never heard from them after that. I'm still waiting to be 
contacted by Telephone so far nothing yet. They make me laugh 
sometimes. I had the RS-12-469 on the one day I was just listening to 
what they were chatting about. I found my daughters old Fart Machine 
and was playing with it while the RS radio was running to see if it 
still works which it did. All of a sudden after I made it " Toot " I 
heard a female voice say " Phew !!! ."
LOL, I guess she thought I really passed one. Also, the other day I 
was on the RS 12-469 and I said " Hello Lisa how are you doing 
today ? " Then a few seconds later I hear a female voice say " 
Bruce ? " like she thought that I was Bruce talking to her. I told her 
no it's me Ralph from Harrisburg,PA she replied "Oh, okay fine. " I 
hear all the time voices calling for Lisa she must be a very Popular 
Technician. Oh well I guess it was more than one question LOL. Hey you 
all take care and " Keep the Sweep " a new slogan for here LOL. just 
kidding. You all have a great day.

Regards,

Ralph the Ghost Hunter
