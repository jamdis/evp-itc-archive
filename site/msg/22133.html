<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have found, it doesn&#x27;t matter what time of day or where you are physically at, the spirits can speak to you through the box.

I use mine for missing person cases, and I don&#x27;t need to go on site anywhere to get reliable information.  I prefer to sit in my house and ask the spirits for help or to get a spirit that can help me.  Going on site is a PIA and is not needed.

&gt; that the rest of the world is asleep and other sounds are at a minimum.
&gt; I&#x27;ve done plenty of work in broad daylight.  Evening just allows me to cut
&gt; out outside sounds like traffic, children, dogs, etc.

&gt; &gt; My aplogies! I don&#x27;t mean to offend, and I am no engineer, and know
&gt; &gt; someone can make this crap better. But after years of being insulted,
&gt; &gt; belittled by skpetic and believers alike, I have reached a saturation
&gt; &gt; point. I&#x27;m not gonna take anymore. Have someone saying I ripped off the
&gt; &gt; idea-someone that has no clue about electronics, yet claiming I resisted
&gt; &gt; his help-just beyond all my tolerance a patience.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I started this group, and by some accidental foresight gave owner ship to
&gt; &gt; someone else, otherwise I would have deleted this thing. Endless
&gt; &gt; arguements, and people seeking only to make a name for themselves off my
&gt; &gt; work and the paranormal in general. Most get into this crap for ghost
&gt; &gt; hunting, something I do not support as it is a focus on darkness and fear,
&gt; &gt; nothing else. I think most--not all--hauntings are suggestion and
&gt; &gt; Hollywood. No one wants to hear that, they want the fear, the negativity,
&gt; &gt; and when I disagree, I am the evil bastard.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I didn&#x27;t make boxes for some duffus to sit in the dark with yelling
&gt; &gt; retarded questions at a radio--that&#x27;s stupid! It was to hear from guides
&gt; &gt; and other spirits, and find there is an afterlife. You can do that at home.
&gt; &gt; Once again, everyone is gonna know better, after all you have to go the
&gt; &gt; haunted hot spots cuz they have the portals--more pure BS.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think I should just withdraw from this insanity, I made this stuff for
&gt; &gt; my own curiosity, and obviously, it does not apply to the real world.
