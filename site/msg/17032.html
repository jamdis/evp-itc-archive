This isn&#x27;t life-or-death discussion. It&#x27;s all just supposed to be in fun.
Have some fun with it.

&gt; &gt; Really good example of paradolia.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Notice how the &#x27;artist&#x27; only marked the areas he wanted that would force
&gt; it to look like a face.Â  If the artist had been consistent, it&#x27;s obvious
&gt; there is a 3rd eye to the right.Â  But marking that would damage his
&gt; interpretation, so he left it out.Â  Even a fourth eye next to the
&gt; &#x27;nostril&#x27;.Â
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And noticed how he only marked enough of the mouth to make it look like a
&gt; mouth.Â  If he followed the shadow, it would damage his interpretation.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And notice how he added &#x27;eyebrows&#x27; only ABOVE the eye, even though,
&gt; again, if he was consistent, he would have had to mark the same image below
&gt; the eyes.
