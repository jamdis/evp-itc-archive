<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi, Bruce.  Can you clarify how your RS hack system is set-up when 
you are receiving messages such as this one and in the files: &quot;11-26-
07_radio shack hack files_bruce&quot;.  They seem much cleaner than what I 
am getting with the 12-469.  Are these recorded right out of the 
speaker with an amped mic picking up your voice and the speaker 
sounds?

Thanks...

LC

&gt; 
&gt; During a session with the RS 470 my technition mike told me that 
our 
&gt; fellow researcher Jeff&#x27;s uncle was going to die from suffering a 
stroke.
&gt; 
&gt; I informed jeff of the message and sent him the file. He wrote back 
&gt; asking If I could confirm this and get his uncles name.
&gt; 
&gt; I did another quick session with the RS 470 and recieved the name 
mark 
&gt; from my guide lisa just once and then mike and lisa both shouted 
BOB,BOB
&gt; die. 
&gt; 
&gt; I notified Jeff of this and he confirmed he had both an uncle Mark 
And 
&gt; an uncle Bob, after inquiring about the condition of his uncle Bob 
he 
&gt; was informed that his uncle Bob was hospitalised and graveley ill.
&gt; 
&gt; He has not as of now suffered a stroke thank god, but jeff seems to 
&gt; think his prognoses is not good.
&gt; 
&gt; I ask that we all say a prayer for Uncle Bob.
&gt; 
&gt; I posted this and the accompanying file for pure research sake.
&gt; 
&gt; Jeff has said he will keep me posted and I will appropriately keep 
the 
&gt; group informed.
