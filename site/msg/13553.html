I've spent a portion of t=
he day researching the block diagram of the original spiricom device. I saw=
 there was room for improvement with the ghost box movement we are aware of=
. Being a musician, i have a room all set up with most of the components of=
 the spiricom system already. What i did was study the block diagram and in=
stead of adding an AM receiver, i added the Sangean AM receiver to sweep in=
stead of using an off station. For the tones, i used my laptop using evp as=
sistant mic'd through my PA system. I also incorporated tape deck noise for=
 tone and an RF transmitter that i had to make my guitar wireless originall=
y and on the receiver end of the transmitter i used the AM sweep. I posted =
2 youtube videos, the first one was a little dark but the communication was=
 good to listen to. Let me know what you think of this.

Here are the links=
 to the videos:
