<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The info on the boards was provided for techies, incase they wanted to
order the boards *and assmeble them.*  With Christmas coming, I have no
money for parts and am having a hard time assembling the boxes I need to get
done.  The PCBs have to ordered in sets of three, that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t make
many of these. That&#x27;s $85 just for the boards, and maybe another $60 for
parts, and labor= endless hours and no pay. I can go to RS and get a perf
board that will make two systems for about 6 bucks.  There is absolutely
zero profit in this stuff.
