The pangram file I did was probably one of the best I was getting live feedback when they were helping me with the settings for that file.

Sounded like you used the\n&gt; allophone file for the raw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; audio. Ive had some good results using Stefans\n&gt; evpmaker software. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I did. I think that sample was the allophone\n&gt; slowed by 20%.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What else other than white noise / allophone do\n&gt; people use?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~ Becca\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Compete with the big boys.
