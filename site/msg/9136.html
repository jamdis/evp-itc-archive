<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s a lot better than the simple ad I suggested.  :-)

&gt; MAKE YOUR OWN GHOST BOX
&gt; 
&gt; You can make your own Ghost box that functions similar to a Frank&#x27;s 
&gt; box, Joe&#x27;s box and the Mini box. All you need to do is go to your 
&gt; local Radio Shack and pick up the 12-469  Digital AM/FM Pocket Radio 
&gt; for ONLY $24.99 plus tax and with a simple modification. You will 
&gt; have your very own cheap alternative to a &quot;GHOST BOX&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; (I will insert a picture of the RS 12-469 here)
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; This simple modification lets the radio sweep both the AM and FM 
&gt; band. Instead of it scanning and stopping on a station, doing the 
&gt; modification (clipping the &quot;Mute&quot; pin) lets it just sweep the entire 
&gt; band, without stopping on any station. Just hook your Radio up to 
&gt; some speakers or headphones and while the radio is sweeping the 
&gt; bands start asking questions and get answers in real time.  You can 
&gt; also record it and review it later for answers you may have missed.
&gt; 
&gt; There are several sites for the FREE instructions on how to modify 
&gt; your Radio Shack 12-469.
