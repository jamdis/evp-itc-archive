I find that if I&#39;m not getting very good reception on one band, I&#39;ll ask the spirits if I should switch bands. They usually give me a yes or no answer, or some form thereof. If you have any more questions about the use of the 469, let us know.\n\nChad\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: ourobouros2k2 &lt;ourobouros2k2@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Tuesday, September 9, 2008 6:51:23 PM\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] Re: First run, 12-469 in my apartment\n\n\nThanks K, just have to say I was not prepared for the immediate \nrelevant responses I got.
