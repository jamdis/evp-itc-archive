I have found\nthat location does not matter, it just seems to be that if someone wants to\nswear, they will.  I used to get vulgarity quite frequently, but then I\nstarted addressing it directly.  If I hear a swear word, or if I am working\nwith a group and the Others start picking on someone, I tell them to knock\nit off and that being vulgar is not conducive to communication.  If they\ncontinue, I threaten to turn off the box and this seems to quiet them down.\n Once I started doing this, the vulgarity has almost ceased in my\ncommunications.\n\nBut, on the other hand, vulgarity is exactly the kind of proof that we have\nthat there is something to ghost box communication.  Title 18 of the US Code\nprohibits the utterance of &quot;any obscene, indecent or profane language by\nmeans of radio communication.&quot;  So when these vulgarities appear, you can\npretty much rule out any radio broadcast over the standard AM/FM bands.\n This, in my mind and many other GB researchers, constitutes communication.\n\n\nYour best bet is to try to coax them into limiting their use of profanity\nand hopefully it will work for you.  Be sure to document the swears though!\n As unfortunate as it is, these are some of the most credible pieces of\nevidence.\n\nTim\n\n\nOn Fri, Oct 8, 2010 at 3:42 PM, Adriana Jones &lt;adrianamjones@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I know that there are many spirits who are vulgar, malicious, liars,\n&gt; troublemakers, etc. Last night I did my first ghost box session alone, (my\n&gt; second session overall - or third if I count the synth voice box session).\n&gt; During the session, I was feeling a little bit self-conscious and\n&gt; discouraged, not sure if it would work for me alone, etc. so my mood was a\n&gt; little down, maybe negative.... also I&#39;m a relatively young female (28). I&#39;m\n&gt; wondering if its due to those two factors that I received - upon going back\n&gt; to listen to the recorded session (I&#39;ll try to post files up later for\n&gt; confirmation)... a series of unwelcoming and vulgar messages... toward the\n&gt; beginning of the session someone said &quot;you&#39;re too young&quot; and then a while\n&gt; into it I got &quot;h* cheats, hit me hit me hit me hit me&quot;... and then toward\n&gt; the end of the session I got &quot;a**hole&quot;. (Frank, please let me know if I&#39;ve\n&gt; crossed the line as far as posting up vulgar words on this group - not sure\n&gt; how else to discuss my session, lol... and I do apologize)\n&gt;\n&gt; So here&#39;s the thing, I can alter my attitude, to be more positive, but I\n&gt; can&#39;t alter my age and gender... so any other females get vulgar messages\n&gt; like this? And what can I do about it? What should I say? I really have no\n&gt; desire to continue with these sessions if this is how I get treated... I\n&gt; guess I was an easy target, just starting out with the ghost box, and not\n&gt; being a confident type, I&#39;m a shy, timid, walk-all-over-me type too\n&gt; often.... how do I &quot;administer discipline&quot; in this situation? Does it work\n&gt; to just tell them to please stop it, or that you&#39;re not welcome if you don&#39;t\n&gt; behave, etc? Or does that only egg them on further?
