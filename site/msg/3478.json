Yes it can. It takes a certain level of acceptance though. You have to accept the fact that every entity in existence is not spiritually equal but has the capability to become equal. Every entity has a right to this knowledge and has the ability to gain it with or without technical means. You have to accept that all realities are true in the eyes of those who behold them.

I&#39;ll tell you \nwhy, because people are starting to realise you are nothing but a \ncarnival side show palm raeder and have fooled people long enough. \n\nthe reason I am addresing moon directly on this group is I know he is \nlurking in the shadows to see what is happening with real researchers \nand will know at least what I think of him.\nI have done more legitimate box research in one week than he has done \never. My results are posted I challenge him to do the same.\n\nhere is a copy of his malicious blog from myspace.\nchris moon&#39;s blog on myspace this morning ***\n\nWednesday, November 28, 2007 \n\nThe Box has hit the fan! \nCurrent mood: distressed \nCategory: Dreams and the Supernatural \n\nAs so many of you know, I have been the primary tester of the \nTelephone to the Dead, a.k.a. &quot;Frank&#39;s Box&quot; since 2004, and have had \ngreat success using it in paranormal research, and more currently, \nconnecting the living with those on the other side. I have recently \nbeen made aware that there are several replica versions of this \ndevice being sold. I have also been told of another device that can \nbe purchased for very little from any electronics merchant and \naltered by hand, producing what some consider to be results. As I \nexpected, the samples that people have sent me are nothing more than \ntimed radio scans that have no validity. \n\nWhat is important to remember, before purchasing any of these replica \ndevices, is that the Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides on the \nother side have repeatedly explained that the way that the Telephone \nto the Dead technology works, is by spirit energy manipulating the \nrandom voltage generator (RVG) and using white and pink noise, as \nwell as radio fragment, to create real time voice answers to \nquestions posed from our side. The most important aspect to this \ndevice is the medium operator who works as an antenna \nor &quot;interpreter&quot; for living individuals asking the questions. \n\nThomas Edison, in an intelligent spiritual discussion through the \nTelephone to the Dead, stated that there were only thirty of these \nindividuals that could effectively use the device. Four have been \nidentified to this point. \n\nI have spent nearly four years testing and doing paranormal research \nwith the Telephone to the Dead, and I have built strong relationships \nwith Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides who I trust, and who trust \nme. These new &quot;radio scanners&quot; are not only a waste of money for \npeople looking to do research with them in hopes of having effective \ncommunication with the other side, but may in fact be very dangerous. \nShould demonic and other negative entities learn to use these false \ndevices, the results could be devastating. Though I rarely see eye to \neye with the Catholic Church on the matter of using the Telephone to \nthe Dead, I do admit that they predicted the widespread sale of false \ncommunication devices as far back as last year. I have recently begun \nto receive requests from individuals asking for help to close \nnegative doorways and portals that they believe they opened using \ntheir purchased Telephone to the Dead replica. Others are claiming \nthat I am a fraud because their purchased device doesn&#39;t produce the \npositive results I have been fortunate enough to have, and claim that \ntherefore, all of my results MUST be false. \n\nI can see this spiraling out of control already. Once again, I will \ncontinue my research with the actual Telephone to the Dead as well as \nprovide public demonstrations and private readings for those truly \ninterested in real time spirit communication. Please feel free to \ncontact me with any questions at\n\nBruce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n&lt;!--\n\n#ygrp-mkp{\nborder:1px solid #d8d8d8;font-family:Arial;margin:14px 0px;padding:0px 14px;}\n#ygrp-mkp hr{\nborder:1px solid #d8d8d8;}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd{\ncolor:#628c2a;font-size:85%;font-weight:bold;line-height:122%;margin:10px 0px;}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads{\nmargin-bottom:10px;}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad{\npadding:0 0;}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a{\ncolor:#0000ff;text-decoration:none;}\n--&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;!--\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc{\nfont-family:Arial;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc #hd{\nmargin:10px 0px;font-weight:bold;font-size:78%;line-height:122%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc .ad{\nmargin-bottom:10px;padding:0 0;}\n--&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;!--\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg {font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;}\n#ygrp-mlmsg table {font-size:inherit;font:100%;}\n#ygrp-mlmsg select, input, textarea {font:99% arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;}\n#ygrp-mlmsg pre, code {font:115% monospace;}\n#ygrp-mlmsg * {line-height:1.22em;}\n#ygrp-text{\nfont-family:Georgia;\n}\n#ygrp-text p{\nmargin:0 0 1em 0;}\n#ygrp-tpmsgs{\nfont-family:Arial;\nclear:both;}\n#ygrp-vitnav{\npadding-top:10px;font-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;margin:0;}\n#ygrp-vitnav a{\npadding:0 1px;}\n#ygrp-actbar{\nclear:both;margin:25px 0;white-space:nowrap;color:#666;text-align:right;}\n#ygrp-actbar .left{\nfloat:left;white-space:nowrap;}\n.bld{font-weight:bold;}\n#ygrp-grft{\nfont-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;padding:15px 0;}\n#ygrp-ft{\nfont-family:verdana;font-size:77%;border-top:1px solid #666;\npadding:5px 0;\n}\n#ygrp-mlmsg #logo{\npadding-bottom:10px;}\n\n#ygrp-vital{\nbackground-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:2px 0 8px 8px;}\n#ygrp-vital #vithd{\nfont-size:77%;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;color:#333;text-transform:uppercase;}\n#ygrp-vital ul{\npadding:0;margin:2px 0;}\n#ygrp-vital ul li{\nlist-style-type:none;clear:both;border:1px solid #e0ecee;\n}\n#ygrp-vital ul li .ct{\nfont-weight:bold;color:#ff7900;float:right;width:2em;text-align:right;padding-right:.5em;}\n#ygrp-vital ul li .cat{\nfont-weight:bold;}\n#ygrp-vital a{\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\n#ygrp-vital a:hover{\ntext-decoration:underline;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #hd{\ncolor:#999;font-size:77%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov{\npadding:6px 13px;background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov ul{\npadding:0 0 0 8px;margin:0;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov li{\nlist-style-type:square;padding:6px 0;font-size:77%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov li a{\ntext-decoration:none;font-size:130%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #nc{\nbackground-color:#eee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:0 8px;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad{\npadding:8px 0;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad #hd1{\nfont-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#628c2a;font-size:100%;line-height:122%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad a{\ntext-decoration:none;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad a:hover{\ntext-decoration:underline;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad p{\nmargin:0;}\no{font-size:0;}\n.MsoNormal{\nmargin:0 0 0 0;}\n#ygrp-text tt{\nfont-size:120%;}\nblockquote{margin:0 0 0 4px;}\n.replbq{margin:4;}\n--&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better pen pal. \nText or chat with friends inside Yahoo!

I have recently begun&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;to receive requests from individuals asking for help to close&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;negative doorways and portals that they believe they opened using&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;their purchased Telephone to the Dead replica. Others are claiming&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;that I am a fraud because their purchased device doesn&#39;t produce the&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;positive results I have been fortunate enough to have, and claim that&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;therefore, all of my results\n MUST be false.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can see this spiraling out of control already. Once again, I will&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;continue my research with the actual Telephone to the Dead as well as&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;provide public demonstrations and private readings for those truly&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;interested in real time spirit communication. Please feel free to&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;contact me with any questions at&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bruce&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;  \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      &lt;hr size=1&gt;Never miss a thing.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.rd.yahoo.com/evt=51438/*http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs&quot;&gt; Make Yahoo your homepage.&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-1075355182-1196359543=:39189--"}
