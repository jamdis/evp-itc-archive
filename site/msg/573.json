I&#39;ll keep experimenting with \nseveral setups. I think i&#39;ll try to play the white noise through a \nspeaker and record via microphone.\n\nWhat about EVPMaker, do you get good results with it? I haven&#39;t \nstudied it but i have some doubts regarding how exactly the spirits \nmanage to imprint the voices, since it&#39;s a digital process?!\n\nRegards,\nJaime.\n\n&gt;1b. Re: EVP support\n&gt;     Posted by: &quot;Misty Dawn&quot; bulletbabea@... bulletbabea\n&gt;     Date: Wed Nov 15, 2006 8:50 pm ((PST))\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi Jaime\n&gt;\n&gt;   I&#39;ve never used the generators but I have heard alot of success \n&gt; stories involving them. I use a natural white noise when I record \n&gt; and get good results. The water from the fishtank is pumped thru a \n&gt; charcoal filter creating a waterfall effect and the running water \n&gt; has always been a benefit to my sessions.\n&gt;\n&gt;   However when using background sounds like water or music I \n&gt; usually find its best to not blast the sound and to turn the \n&gt; recording mic down halfway 50% loudness so it doesnt drown out the \n&gt; voices. I also find that most of the material is located within the \n&gt; recording at a much slower speed. For mine the more audible voices \n&gt; are usually located at -74 percent slowed (if using audacity to \n&gt; slow it) and sometimes at -30 when they have alot to get across.\n&gt;\n&gt;   So try adjusting the sound volume and the recording mic volume \n&gt; and see if that helps. And dont forget to try slowing it down and \n&gt; listening to it in forward and reverse.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Good luck!\n&gt;   Misty\n\n\nSend instant messages to your online friends http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com"}
