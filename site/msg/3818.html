&gt; This &#x27;negativity&#x27; is bad enough, I wouldn&#x27;t even want it on the group except Moon is the one that says everyone else,  me and the group included, gets only &#x27;false communcation&#x27; or &#x27;bad guys&#x27;, and that&#x27;s from his own friggin&#x27; blog, I didn&#x27;t make that up, or pull it out of my butt. So it effects us all, and I think is open for discussion/comment knowing this will get forwarded back to him. In fact I&#x27;ll cc Moon this posting.   When he says all these scan radio users, that means me to, since I use the things, and I prefer the linear scan mode. What I say about the box use is completely disregarded, and what I get through the box, myself, as The Box Maker, is minimalized by Moon. Moon puts my name out there connected with his so called &#x27;telephone to the dead&#x27;, and I very much disapprove of my name being applied to an unauthorized use of my equipment. I don&#x27;t give a crap what he gets through the boxes, or does with it, but don&#x27;t make it look like I designed it specificaly as the &#x27;telephone to the dead&#x27;, I designed it as a friggin&#x27; ITC device, that is capable of two way communication--SOMETIMES, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a guarenteed connection, and you can&#x27;t just dial up anyone, anytime, that&#x27;s an exageration! The &quot;box&quot; was intended by me to be used in a fixed location, just by taking it to a GHU, or an &quot;investiigation&quot; is using it in a way I did not intend, and I still say it&#x27;s better if used in one place. All guide lines I have offered for box use are completely ignored, not just by Moon, to be fair.  
&gt;  
&gt;   It has been shown that many different approaches work for this communcation, I suggest Moon design and build his own &#x27;telephone the dead&#x27; and leave my name out of it.

 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =   Hi Frank &amp; All, My question is: How does Chris Moon KNOW we all are getting &quot;False communications&quot; from &quot;dark entities&quot; or whatever he is claiming???! This is an insult (slap-in-the-face comment) and untrue = thus &quot;slander&quot;! IMHO I personally don&#x27;t like it! I have been researching EVP&#x27;s - on &amp; off - since about 1968-1970, when I first heard about it! Longer than Chris has been alive! 8-(     =Judy=</pre>
