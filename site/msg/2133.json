I am about as \npsychic as an old tree trunk. For over a year and a half I stumbled \naround various locations with my trusted crummy microcassette \nrecorder trying to record an EVP. Then, on my last certification \ntraining investigation something dropped in front of me and rolled \nacross the floor in total darkness in a very old building,---  It \nnearly soiled my shorts!\n\nI recorded my first EVP at that location that night. But it was a \ngrade C crummy one.\n\nIt was not until I began to use a multi-digital recorder system that \nI began to get a great deal of EVP&#39;s. I utilze 11 of them now on a \ntypical home investigation. I have noticed a link between EMF fields \nand EVP gathering in the cases I have been involved in as well.\n\nI speak very loudly when performing an intereactive EVP session. \nThis might be a factor since I have recorded most of our EVP&#39;s in \nour investigative group. But who knows? I am not developed \npsychically though. I did have an experience at Waverly Hills in \nKentucky three weeks ago on an investigation. Our team had recorded \nnumerous EVP&#39;s by the infamous Room 502. We are still analyzing \nthem. I walked into this very dark room at about 04:00 hours on the \n3rd floor. Two team members were about 10 feet behind me talking. \nThe hair on the back of my neck stood up. I took out my digital \nrecorder and got a moaning evp from it after I asked it&#39;s name.\n\nPsychic? Or just plain luck?\n\nJames\n\n \n\n\nIn EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the reasons I believe the researcher is often part of the\n&gt; process is because some investigators seem to be able to \nconsistently\n&gt; obtain evp&#39;s while others are not, despite many attempts over \nyears of\n&gt; investigating. Sometimes the teams in CA refer to those who often \nget\n&gt; decent results as &quot;evp magnets&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; I think the individuals who can easily obtain good results (no \nmatter\n&gt; where they are) may be able to channel their psychic abilities \ninto PK\n&gt; energy and record the results as an evp. I&#39;m not suggesting this is\n&gt; what happens every time but it may be what&#39;s happening in some of \nthe\n&gt; cases.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Bill \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;delchay2005&quot; &lt;azredant@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- \n&gt; &gt; Hi Tracy,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you study human agent poltergeist cases of psychokinesis, the \n&gt; &gt; identified human agent is always in the house of structure when \nthe \n&gt; &gt; objects move.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The famous Miami Hotel case that Dr. William Roll investigated \nis a \n&gt; &gt; great example. When a certain kitchen worker was present, all \nsorts \n&gt; &gt; of objects were thrown around the room. When he was not there, \n&gt; &gt; nothing happened. When he left the Hotel for good, no more \nactivity \n&gt; &gt; was ever recorded.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would like to try to rule out, or, support the theory that we \nare \n&gt; &gt; not, or that we might be imprinting EVP&#39;s on audio tracks or \ntape.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My own personal experience in EVP gathering leads me to believe \nthat \n&gt; &gt; this is phenomena driven, not my subconscious mind.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But now I have to try and find out the truth for myself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This last year we saw an incredible amount of EVP&#39;s being \nrecorded \n&gt; &gt; during our cases we investigated. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://arizonaparanormalinvestigations.com/api_gallery/index.php?\n&gt; &gt; cat=4\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The above is our link to our new EVP gallery if you would like \nto \n&gt; &gt; listen to them. These were all recorded in the last year using  \n&gt; &gt; multiple recorders in each location. There is a Grade A and a \nGrade \n&gt; &gt; B icon to seperate them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; James\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Tracy &lt;loneshewolf999@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not sure this would still rule it out.  I don&#39;t think \n&gt; &gt; psychokinesis is restrained by walls, the mind isn&#39;t restrained \nby \n&gt; &gt; walls whether human or deceased.  I am guessing that \npsychokinesis \n&gt; &gt; behaves similar to telepathy....\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I believe many evp&#39;s are deceased spirits, but the question \non \n&gt; &gt; whether it could be a living person imprinting the evps was \n&gt; &gt; certainly one that made me really think !  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;               Hi James,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Back when I still investigated haunted sites, our team did \nthis on \n&gt; &gt; various occasions within a house where we recorded several hours \nof \n&gt; &gt; activity over a few years (a long term investigation). We would \n&gt; &gt; leave our audio equipment recording in several &quot;hot spots&quot; all \nover \n&gt; &gt; the house and then leave for an hour or two. I have to say, in \nour \n&gt; &gt; experience we never got an EVP while we were out of the house. \nAs a \n&gt; &gt; matter of fact we had an EVP when we reentered the house \n&gt; &gt; saying, &quot;here they come, lets go&quot;. I don&#39;t necessarily \nunderstand \n&gt; &gt; why a ghost or spirit would talk with no one present to receive \nthe \n&gt; &gt; message unless during setup you explained what you are trying to \n&gt; &gt; accomplish and what the spirits roll is in the experiment (we \nnever \n&gt; &gt; tried explaining). A piece of machinery (recorders) in an empty \nroom \n&gt; &gt; does not have a consciousness or spiritual presence I would be \n&gt; &gt; interested to see if you get different results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: delchay2005 &lt;azredant@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 18, 2007 6:47:24 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] EVP Experiment planned in October.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;     To try and rule out that the EVP researchers are \nimprinting \n&gt; &gt; voices \n&gt; &gt; &gt; psychokinetically on audio players mistaken as ghosts voices, \nI \n&gt; &gt; will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pre-tape an interactive evp session.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will record a bank of thirty questions, 20 seconds of \nsilence \n&gt; &gt; &gt; after each question, on a cassete tape and played on a \ncassette \n&gt; &gt; &gt; player that will be utilized in all three buildings in a known \n&gt; &gt; &gt; haunted location just outside of Phoenix, Arizona.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There will be digital recorders, cassette recorders, omni \n&gt; &gt; &gt; directional microphones, condensor microphones, as well as an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; electrocet boom microphone present in all of the sessions. \nThere \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be no human agents in the buildings when these sessions \ntake \n&gt; &gt; &gt; place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My hope is to:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Record an authentic EVP with no human agent in the building. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If this is phenomena driven, will the phenomena communicate by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; responding to questions from a machine rather than a human \nagent? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you have any ideas to enhance this experiment, please feel \nfree \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to let me know.
