<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi i am really interested in evp/itc and have been recording for 
aproximately 5/6 months i currently do both normal evp work and also 
radio scanning(not franks box or radio shack hacks) but manually 
scanning through the channels..i have been quite surprised by the 
results that i have got.
I have video posted on youtube(screen name mazblondie) and it would be 
excellent if anyone could give there opinions.
I have had many different theory presented to me, from imaginationto 
plain faking it, but i can believe that it is all down to chance!!
Hope to hear from you soon.
Marie</pre>
