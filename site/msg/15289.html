<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah the sweep chip for the 469 required soldering, but i couldn&#x27;t get it to work.  I sent pictures to bill and he said i had it hooked up right, maybe it was a bad chip.

&gt; Worked on ratka&#x27;s I think but involved soldering, something I dont mess with LOL I think some of the ones you found to modify are far easier for most people to attempt as well as locate the dang radio in the first place.

&gt; Yeah, that chip was a an adjustable sweep rate for the 469. But, i could never get it to work. It didn&#x27;t take out the clicking, i should be so lucky.

&gt; &gt; Yeah that clicking noise is maddening Steve. Theres never a doubt when you hear it as to what they are using. Bill/Sum was sending out chips to solder into the 469 that actually got rid of that clicking but I&#x27;m not sure what it was. Frank Ratka may remember he sent him one along with others. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Steve is right tho he hasmodified much better models that sound much smoother!
