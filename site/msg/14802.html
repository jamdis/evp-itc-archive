<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The clicking is definitely annoying, but we get great results with that box as well.  I would like to know if there is a way to eliminate the clicking sound somehow.

&gt; Hey,
&gt;  
&gt; I have worked with the 469, 470, 125 , and the sangean.
&gt; The best results I have so far are from the 469 - even with the clicking!
&gt; Like you, I just tune out the clicking - but our video guy can&#x27;t stand it.

&gt; I am using the 12-469 radio hacked by myself with the help of UFOGeek&#x27;s step by step video on youtube.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for not stating that earlier. I wish i had the older one 12-470 with the built in speaker. from the video&#x27;s i been watching it doesn&#x27;t seem to have that annoying click in between each AM channel.
&gt; 
&gt; After conditioning my ears i can block outthat clicking noise now, but my teammates can&#x27;t and get distracted from it.
