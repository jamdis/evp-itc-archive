I&#39;ve\nheard things in person, but this is the first time I actually had it\nrecorded and I&#39;m psyched -- I think this next year is going to be a\ndoozie!\n\nI&#39;ll post it once I&#39;ve had a chance to isolate it in Audacity and\nlisten a few times. Anyway ~ \n\nHappy New Year and much progress & success in this next year!"}
