<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>lol, you&#x27;re prolly right!  I would completely dismiss the 2012 thing as another y2k hysteria if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that they say different cultures around the world all say something about 2012. And now again that could all be a lie and concoction, but then again how long could a lie like that last?  not sure... either way it&#x27;s kinda interesting...

&gt;  Everyone thinks they can just go hunting, there would be about three deer
&gt; left in the whole country by December 22nd, 2012. On the 23rd, all the dogs
&gt; would be gone, on the 24th, we&#x27;d eat each other.
&gt;  The whole warning thing is to get your head prepared for a sudden
&gt; transition to spirit.

&gt; &gt; All I know about 2012 worth remembering is that different people say a
&gt; &gt; bunch of different cultures all point toward something happening in 2012...
&gt; &gt; ****if**** this is true, then that&#x27;s some crazy-*** **it, indeed!! The other
&gt; &gt; thing I heard about it is that nasa-confirmed the sun&#x27;s going to be throwing
&gt; &gt; some temper tantrums worse than usual.... personally, if it makes the power
&gt; &gt; go out, I&#x27;m all for it, our modern pace is way to fast, unnatural and
&gt; &gt; stressful... as far as rioting and looting, I&#x27;ll leave that to the idiots
&gt; &gt; who still believe they can eat, drink and sleep money :) If I have to break
&gt; &gt; my veganism at that point, I will be well justified in doing so, I&#x27;ll be the
&gt; &gt; first one out there hunting deer if I have to... and if a giant asteriod is
&gt; &gt; supposed to land on my a** in 2012, then I&#x27;m not even going to worry about
&gt; &gt; it till then, lol!
