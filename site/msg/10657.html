Hey Mike, tell your Catholic friend that the Vatican, under John Paul approved experimentation with ITC. There are several Vatican priests who experiment with direct radio voice ITC.zammit

Roman Catholics were
given the Church's blessing yesterday to "contact" loved ones beyond
the grave. Leading Vatican theologian Father
Gino Concetti said it is no longer a sin, as long as mediums, fortune teller
and palmists are not involved.
The pronouncement
came after Italian magazine claims that contact with the spiritual world had
produced miracles. Father Concetti dismissed that,  but added: 'We can
pray for our loved ones. They will respond in dreams and inspiration. In one
example, a grandmother advised a girl about her marriage choice in a dream. The
girl did not heed counsel and a grave problem developed. If we pray seriously
in a quiet place, with our hearts and our voices, the departed will express
themselves and advise us.'
(Printed in the LondonDaily
Mail, 29-Nov-96)

Concetti, one of the most competent theologians in the Vatican, said in an interview:
'According to the

moments of our lives. The Church has decided not to forbid anymore the dialogue
with the deceased with the condition that these contacts are carried out with a
serious religious and scientific purpose.'

The Pope explains to
us "What actually happens to us at the moment of death?"
This question has
occupied mankind for centuries. Jesus promised that a final judgment will come,
an all-last day. But what occurs to the souls of those who die before this
point in time?
Pope John Paul II
explained it in Rome
before pilgrims. He said:
'One should not
think life begins after death only with the final judgment. Quite special
conditions prevail after natural death. It concerns a transitional phase in
which the body dissolves and where the life of a mirror-image entity (the soul)
begins.'
'This entity is
equipped with its own consciousness and its own will, so that humans exist,
although they no longer possess a physical body.'
A member of the
international papal theological advises: 'At the moment of death humans make an
enormous discovery. The soul does not only leave the body, but humans discover
the secret of time. Because it becomes timeless, steps into eternity.'
(From the German
journal Bild, 1998 October 30 in an article, "The moment of death;
what occurs to our soul?')

To add to that.
 
Kay, since starting box research this past January, 2008, I have had one close friend already tell me the responses are nothing but CB or two way radio traffic, and another close friend who is devout Catholic said that I am speaking to the devil. Go figure. 
 
My wife listened to the recordings and says she can not hear the responses.
 
I no longer discuss box research outside the EVP/Paranormal friendships I have.
 
Its just like UFO's. Some people believe they exist and others believe they are military test vehicles.
 
For the past week and a half, I have been assisting Juli in a missing person case, and have been doing the box recordings for her. I conected with the boy right away who has been missing for over a year, and the info he has given us is info only the police detectives know, as it has not been released to the press. The boy has answered every question posed to him.
 
Either you believe in spirit contact or you do not. Some people believe in God and others do not. 
 
It seems to me the people that do not believe in spirit contact whether through a medium, box devices or personal experiences, are those that have never had an experience.
 
I have had a handful since my youth and adult life, and from the first one I had, I was hooked and never looked back.

Hi Kay. Your boyfriend's opinion is one of the reasons why I put great weight on relevance 
of content in a session. For example, when I recently asked for Rees' great uncle to say 
his name, and an immediate reply of "It's Chuck Clarke" is heard (even though Rees 
referred to him as Charlie, both are nicknames for Charles) I think the odds would be quite 
astronomical of that being coincidence. Same goes for any of us asking a question, any 
question, and receiving a relevant response ... it would be highly unlikely for it to be from 
stray signals (of whatever flavor.) 

Then again, if he has trouble even hearing and/or agreeing on the content, it's going to be 
hard for you to get him to view an answer as relevant, even when it is.
