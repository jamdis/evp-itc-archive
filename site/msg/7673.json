I haven&#39;t read enough of the \nmanual yet about the data, if it needs to be in a certain form or \nwhat. Is it just bits, or is it bytes? I&#39;m all rusty and coroded \nwhen it comes to digital.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Need to know the score, the latest news, or you need your Hotmail-\nget your &quot;fix&quot;.\n&gt; http://www.msnmobilefix.com/Default.aspx\n&gt;"}
