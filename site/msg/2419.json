I  used to pick up injured and sick animals and only occasionally would a  caring vet work with me by discounting or payments.  Do you have a  vet school nearby?  Maybe you could call around to see if another  one will work with you on the dog.  Also, call the dog or cat  rescue in your area and ask them what can be done.  Like I said  before, I will contribute.  If the whole group gave a few $$, you  could tell the vet donations will be forthcoming.  If you can get  the leg set, it might be slow healing.  I had a cat that had a  fracture femur and I carried the poor thing to the litter pan at  regular intervals, and the leg healed.  It can be done.  Even  if it is amputated, the dog could make it on three (not as easy with an  elderly dog).  \n  \n  Joanne \n   \nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:                                             It  wasn&#39;t taken like that.
