This seems to jive with what I have learned this far, but I am still not ce=
rtain I understand it completely.

I thought everything was based in the el=
ectromagnetic spectrum.

        Tell me where the seperation on =
the spectrum takes place between 300Hz and 300KHz. Yes, soundwaves cause pr=
essure waves that our ears read as vibration and our mind translates as sou=
nd. The waves are still on the electromagnetic spectrum. Even subsonic geom=
agnetic waves are present on the scale. What I mean by power can be directl=
l translated to volume or amplitude. The only thing that distinguishes soun=
dwaves from any other wave is the fact that we can hear them.

                No. Sounds waves are not on the electromagnet sp=
ectrum nor are they a form of electromagnet energy. Sound waves are based o=
n pressure waves in the air (or in other substances).  Our ears detect thes=
e pressure waves and translate them into sounds we here.  Our ear do NOT he=

                        A mistake that a lot of people make is thinking t=
hat there are two different types of energy at work when it comes to sound =
waves and electromagnetic waves. The only thing that seperates them is freq=
uency and power. Radio waves are radio waves because they occupy a certain =
block of the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same spec=
trum just farther down with much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic wave=
s can penetrate almost anything because of their wavelengths. The shorter t=
he wavelength the more ways we can shield against them.

                  =
      Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and telemetry tra=
nsmitting wave but the waves also have a physical effect on our environment=
 by causing molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A little lower than =
this is IR or infrared it too can cause physical objects to heat up but usu=
ally it just causes molecules to rotate in place. All physical things give =
off IR light. Its a way the total system conserves energy by spontaneously =
emitting IR radiation.

                          Here is some food for thought. I am currently re=
viewing my audio from our May 30th investigation.

                        =
  It was me and another girl teammate present in the room. I picked up a 3r=
d female voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry with me. We were s=
tanding right next to another digital video recorder that I leave beside my=
 night vision camera. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd voice. I have =
asked the girl that was with me to check her recording to see if she picked=
 it up.

                          I have long felt the true EVP does not c=
ome from sound waves in the environment, or then it wouldn't be EVP, but a =
disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are appearing directly on the recordings.
=

                          This instance with the recorders may back that t=
heory up. That other recorder should have picked that voice up if it were s=
ound waves in the environment.

                          I am attaching th=
e clip of this 3rd voice. The file that is named "01-02-17 Clip" is the ful=
l clip. You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", and then another comes in r=
ight after that. I think I know what it says.

                          Ag=
ain, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear this until play=
back. It isn't clear, so I am not as excited about it as my one's from the =
last investigation.

                                I have a running theory that EV=
P is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want =
it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultra=
sonic waves that differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtrac=
t them together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For exampl=
e, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in =
a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a inter=
mediate difference frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz=
 to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic equipment generate=
s ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always fel=
t that EVP were generated within a few inches of the recorder.

           =
                     We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radio=
 with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some =
passive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr.=
 Joseph Pompeii.

                                night. We had six video came=
ras set up in the 
                                three halls of the build=
ing. The video for 
                                all was being moni=
tored and 
                                recorded at a central locat=
