I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an un=
trasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It wo=
rks off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that diff=
er one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them together you g=
et a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is send=
ing a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an un=
trasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference=C2=
=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This=
 was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic sig=
nals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were =
generated within a few inches of the recorder.

We are able to reproduce th=
is affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with acou=
stics and audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce called t=
he "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
