 My Ghostman box. Or a swept tuned Walkman. I've been thinking about the M=
ini box, and we've shown on this group that the sound chamber I use is defi=
nately not needed, so that eliminates the mics and added amps as well. I ki=
nda missed the manufacturing boat by not doing more testing, or being stuck=
 on a concept. Not that I'm all that concerned, I had no desire to make mon=
ey off this stuff, and that probelm seems to have been solved. 
 Despite co=
ncerns by the more conserative researchers, I guess I could call them, I ha=
ve never seen any one harmed by any kind of oracle device(granted-I don't g=
et out much).  I think getting this stuff out there in the public is a good=
 thing.
