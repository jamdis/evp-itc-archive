<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all, I just wanted to introduce myself.  As you can see from my 
addy, my name is Pat and from CT (and sometimes Maine) ...

My youngest son committed suicide 10 yrs ago.  He was one of many 
young men in my family to pass on young (he was 24, I was 43) and our 
birthdays were only a week apart.  His birthday would have been 
Easter Sunday.

I was introduced to Frank&#x27;s Box via Paranormal State and it spiked my 
interest.  I do have an avid interest with the paranormal, howevere, 
I do believe that if I ever had anything happen to me personally, I 
would probably panic.

I am interested in the price of someone making a box for me, and, of 
course, instructions on how to do this and stay safe.  Like many 
others, my interest is contact with family members who have passed 
on, most especially, my son Brian.  He was a believer in these things 
too.  Unfortunately, he was diagnosed with a mental illness, and 
instead of giving meds a try, he felt his life would never 
be &quot;normal&quot; again, and chose to go back home to God and his 
beloved &quot;Gramps&quot;.  I cry just thinking of all this, as my father was 
most Beloved to me too.

If any of you are able to ask the question if Brian or Tom (grandson 
and grandfather) are present, and if they can get any messages to me, 
I would appreciate it.  The tears are streaming down my eyes just 
thinking of all this, as I lost Brian and my Dad within about 18 mos 
of each other.

Have to run, I hear my sis coming home.  Thanks for any help any of 
you could offer.
Pat</pre>
