So it was\nactually in best a preliminary stage to the phonograph. In most cases,\ninventions don&#39;t fall from the sky, and of course it seems very likely\nthat Edison had already heard of the &quot;phonautograph&quot; before he developed\nhis phonograph.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Yeah it makes one wonder. Then again this country not to mention the \n&gt; world as a whole has always been on the brink of new technology which \n&gt; they either cover up or covet to the point others rarely know of its \n&gt; existence. I wonder what else is laying around that was invented that \n&gt; nobody knows about or told others about. I found the smoke thing \n&gt; interesting tho. Never would have thought of that one so I was amazed \n&gt; that someone else did so long before edisons work became the \n&gt; forefront of technology. Considering the time frame it makes me \n&gt; ponder if he had heard of the work or just the idea even was enough \n&gt; to set his wheels turning and get him thinking in that direction.\n\n&gt; Misty\n\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi Misty,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; yeah, fascinating; however, I wonder why mechanical audio recording \n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; reproduction techniques haven&#39;t been invented much earlier, since \n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; technical principle behind that is actually quite straightforward. I\n&gt;&gt; could easily imagine that someone like Leonardo da Vinci could have\n&gt;&gt; invented such a machine...\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Stefan\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; -- \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; I ran across this tonight while surfing the web and found it \n&gt; interesting.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt; &gt;   http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7318180.stm\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt; &gt;   Misty\n&gt;&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n\n&gt; Yahoo!
