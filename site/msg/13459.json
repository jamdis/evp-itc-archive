Really interesting.  \n\nMy hearing is very sensitive, so I don&#39;t know how much of, or for how\nlong, the sounds I heard that I would be able to tolerate.  But I&#39;m\ngoing to go browse a little more or your web site.  \n\nMargaret  \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Doc Stars &lt;docstarsrx008@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to introduce myself.. and share this information with the\ngroup here in the hopes that some members may have an interest in\nparticipating in an experimental research project.\n&gt; \n&gt; Im looking for people who are willing to participate in our online\nexperiment and can provide input, feedback and comparison on some of\nthe various digital frequency files we are using.\n&gt; \n&gt; After many years of researching, on going development and testing\nour current experimental group of approximately 2000 volunteers have\nbeen witness to some really unusual and intense phenomena playing\nout... bordering on the supra-normal. We&#39;re seeing rapid, profound\neffects on the body and mind occuring via this new acoustic frequency\ntool.\n&gt; \n&gt; Specifically, one of the areas we are focusing on now and are hoping\nto collect more data on are the effects on the mind and body from the\nuse of\n&gt; frequencies designed to entrain the body and mind towards those\nstates conducive to the experience of ascension and the manifestation\nof desired positive change.\n&gt; \n&gt; I recently released new &#39;frequency&#39; protoypes that our group has\nbeen testing and their reports of the results they have been\nexperiencing have been staggering.\n&gt; \n&gt; Implications currently, are for enormous  potential improvements for\nhealth and wellness as well as rapid change from challenging mind and\nemotional states to ones of increased vitality, increased performance\nand increased well being and balance.\n&gt; \n&gt; One possible and very real application of this may be to address\nboth general and specific aspects of health issues.  For example one\nof our members experimented with effects on the blood , had an\nindependent lab analyze his blood sample and it seems like there was a\ndramatic change in the bloods terrain!\n&gt; \n&gt; Data collected to date on reaction responses have been over the top\n&gt; favourable.....\n&gt; \n&gt; We are finding that actual &#39;things&#39; are happening, when these\nfrequencies are simply played. Very noticeable and dramatic effects\nand changes in the body, mind and environment - unlike anything\ninduced by any other sound (that we know of).  many people who\nexperimented on these frequencies report that they are unlike other\nexisting technologies such as binaural beats.\n&gt; \n&gt; What we need right now however, are more volunteers who are willing\nto test out our other frequencies and keep a log of their findings and\nreport their observations to our group. There is no cost required for\ntesting frequencies, the primary benefit to my group and I is the\ncollection of data.... the benefit to you, well... once you see what\nwe are engaged in, I think you will be more than satisfied with the\nexperience.....\n&gt; \n&gt; Two things important here, one is to share with you the observations\nof our\n&gt; group in their process of discovery in relation to the health\nrelated frequency track - the thought being, that you are likely to\nnot only find this intrinsically interesting and newsworthy but also\ninspiring. The second is to provide you with a means of facilitating\nyour own journey through this phenomena in the hopes you can share\nyour own unique findings with us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Feel free to view a recent post on our research forum that details\nhow to access this information and also various frequency tracks you\ncan download.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/the_sound_of_stars/message/8216\n&gt; \n&gt; Examples of recent reports by users ;\n&gt; \n&gt; “I am struck with the effects that sound has on the physical\nstructure. That is, especially in the subtle tissues like neurons and\nsynapses. Case in point, I don&#39;t hesitate in expressing myself just\nthe way it comes out. No coloring, no bravado, no bullshit....the\nendorphine level in the body went way up. I have noted from my initial\nlistening of this freq. is that it appears to synchronize the 2\nhemispheres of the brain and thought became markedly coherent. ..\nperhaps the feeling of increased endorphine flow could be an actual\nincrease in neuro- transmitter presence, particularly seratonin.... As\nthings ended I was left with this feeling of balance and well being. I\ndefinitely want to work with this sequence more. It seems to be the\nright one for me currently. I probably want to post this explanation\non the Yahoo site. I&#39;ll be sending my initial impressions in another\nemail to you shortly. Thanks again for this amazing opportunity.”\n&gt; \n&gt; “This morning I listened to kindle mind set, I have had family in\nand had not used the fequencies for a week. The first sensations were\nan extreme energy from my hands I am a Reiki Master but the energy and\nheat I felt was more than I had experienced before.There was a\nbubbling feeling inside my chest their was intense tingling of my\nchest and torso, a sensual, sexual feel.My arms legs and feet were\nextremely warm, I am usually cold. It felt like my blood was\nbubbling.I had an effervesce feeling in my mouth. My feet tingled and\nas I nwas laying on the chaise listening, I closed my eyes and was\nenjoying a full color animated video like p roduction without sound.\nThis is first time I have seen anything other than a magenta colored\nflower.I listened to kindle set for about 3 hours. I have Bose\nspeakers on the computer I used this morning.”\n&gt;"}
