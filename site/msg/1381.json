My friend has been working on these \nfor me and i&#39;m trying them out and starting to get results.  It \nreally takes an aquired ear to catch it real time though, better \nsuccess playing it back later.  I can slow the randomness down, but \nthan people will just say it was a radio station.  I&#39;m sure everyone \nknows how that goes.  I feel if it&#39;s really fast like i&#39;ve done it, \nit&#39;s really not on a station long enough to get a sentence \nout...Right???\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;urkel232002&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Radio is automatic sweep.
