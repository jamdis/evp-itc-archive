<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Welcome Lyn;

I&#x27;m not sure how to advise you. Sometimes you need some kind of background 
nosie for the spirits to make a voices out of, like running water, a fan, or 
white noise. I have my own method I use, but I don&#x27;t have anything I can 
offer at the moment. Often it takes several attempts before you get results.

&gt;
&gt;I&#x27;m a new member, I joined this group in hopes of learning about
&gt;this EVP... hopefully much like what ghost hunters do on their show.
&gt;I am impressed at their &#x27;proof&#x27;.
&gt;
&gt;I live in a house...with a bit of &#x27;unseen&#x27; activity.
&gt;we have only heard voices ourselves a few times...
&gt;
&gt;I have watched things &#x27;move&#x27; in my front room many times  .... and
&gt;know something must be there... and was interested in this EVP...
&gt;I have a small tape recorder... but have not picked up anything.
&gt;
&gt;our activity comes and goes... I cant say its haunted, because it
&gt;does not seem as tho something is &#x27;haunting&#x27; this house...
&gt;instead I think something lives here along with us.
&gt;something that may have been here ages ago.
&gt;
&gt;I just want proof of what we see and hear in this house .
&gt;  and thought learning more about EVP might help us in this quest.
