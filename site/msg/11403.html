<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yep...I listened to the file and heard the word &quot;meditate&quot; very clearly 
in response to your question! I am learning so much and so eager to get 
started with my own experiments :)

&gt; To Angela - I have very poor reception and have gotten discouraged 
more than once to say the least.  I have asked them for advice and I 
clearly received a message that stated I should meditate to help my 
connection.  When I do take the time to meditate before a session it 
does seem to be a better signal. I even asked them right after I 
meditate if it helped and they responded that yes indeed it helped.  Of 
course I am horrible at meditating and I haven&#x27;t taken to the process 
very well :-)  I&#x27;ll post my clips of them telling me to mediate.  Look 
in Kristin&#x27;s File.
