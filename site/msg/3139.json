I&#39;m In Mar Vista near Venice Beach . . not far \n&gt; from &quot;HollyWeird&quot;! LOL.   Would love to be present durring one of \n&gt; your sessions! I&#39;m SOOoooo interested in this subject! I&#39;ve gotten a \n&gt; few EVP&#39;S from my portable Sony cassette tape recorder with external \n&gt; mic - at The Hillcrest Cemetary, near me! It really surprized me - \n&gt; when I heard them!!    \n&gt; =Judy=                                                                \n&gt;                                                                      -\n&gt; -- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Judy, I&#39;m near Hollywood and I work with a small group of like \n&gt; minded\n&gt; &gt; researchers. We have a Frank&#39;s Box and you&#39;ll never, ever have to \n&gt; even\n&gt; &gt; think we would ask for anything from you to participate in a Box\n&gt; &gt; session. -Bill\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;judy_in_hollywood&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;Ticket_to_Heaven@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I started the research with a box i was lucky to have made \n&gt; based \n&gt; &gt; &gt; off \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Frank&#39;s idea.  As all on this board one way or another would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done anything to get their hands on one of Frank&#39;s boxes or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something equivalent.  So, now it&#39;s your chance to get another \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; version of an already great idea and everyone&#39;s complaining.  \n&gt; Isn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this the answer to everyone&#39;s problem, it may be pricey but i \n&gt; know \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who would have paid more in the past for a similar \n&gt; item.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This board is for research, this is just another idea just like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Joe&#39;s idea of joe&#39;s box and frank&#39;s &quot;frank&#39;s box&quot;.  If this \n&gt; version \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t work, than the idea will kill itself.  But, now people \n&gt; can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get to see if they are truly meant to work with the other side \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one of the 30 or 80 or whatever the number is up to now.  I \n&gt; think \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you don&#39;t like this minibox than don&#39;t buy it, but isn&#39;t \n&gt; anybody \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; curious to see the results people get with it or don&#39;t.  Just \n&gt; my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take on it, i think it&#39;s crazy that everyone is getting so \n&gt; upset \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about another form of communication.  It took me back at first \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because i felt this would kill my research, but we don&#39;t know \n&gt; if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this even works yet.  These things happen for a reason by stuff \n&gt; out \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of our control.  All we can do is sit back and watch, and who \n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think someone was going to mass produce this idea eventually \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyway?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Hi Steve H., My thoughts are if the boxes DO work well for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; those that are truely interested in doing research with them - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; daily!! I&#39;d still like to experience one, but am in L.A. - where \n&gt; no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s doing Public demos of it = UGH! Chris -who was in San diego \n&gt; &gt; &gt; today wants $125. for the admission!! Yikes!     =Judy=\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
