<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have only one requirement, can I understand it? Seems to work ok to me.
@ 5 seconds &quot;Dead in Vietnam&quot; and today there was a special on History
about Vietnam war. So criticize all ya want, it still works just fine, any
failure to receive messages is in the loose nut in front of the control
panel. Point your finger at yourself when you tell how my stuff not work.
Random mode is dead mode since we==on this group--discovered linear and
manual sweep works much better. The voice recording was done by Misty, the
actual owner of the group, by manual sweep. Yeah, wonder why I ain&#x27;t
impressed by claims of superior knowledge.

 F-S
