i found out almost the whole book is about 16th century. only a little about 2109
   
  anyway im pretty sure about what is supposed to happen then.  must be using the same nerds from the future.
   
  basically there is a slow turning against a long standing theocracy and an end to the 60 cycle power grid-replaced w something better.
   
  2109 is supposedly the years some "real" scientists successfully signal the year 1974 and give instructions on how to prevent global warming from becoming thermal runaway,
   
  i finally read bits and pieces of the book on the internet various places.  interesting that others get the same scenarios from the same years. nerds in 2157 said something like you can only communicate easily to certain times connected to your own that slowly drift in and out of synch

            hehehe I sent him the same thing bout gettin it on ebay. I am not sure why you guys email is bouncing the group stuff. I'd suggest that you make sure the group email is in your address books in case thats part of the problem. I had the same problem for a short while last year but I guess its not my turn again yet LOL.

  The group isnt showing you as bouncing it shows 2 other members have had bounced emails. Doesnt mean anything really except it probably happened to those guys too. Try the address book thing if you havent already added it.
