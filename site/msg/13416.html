I have to admit that I thoug=
ht I had seen the worst 'paranormal' show on television already. I was wron=
g. Door to the Dead has exceeded my worst expectations.
=A0
Generally, I re=
spect John Oliver's work as a medium. While I have no personal experience w=
ith him, in the past he has looked and acted more genuine than not, the rol=
ling of the eyes put aside for the moment.
=A0
I do take exception to the c=
haracterization of the talking box as an Edison device. I have documented t=
he history of Edison, ITC and EVP=A0=A0elsewhere. This is however the small=
est concern I have with this show.
=A0
Prior to wathcing I had just had a c=
onversation with a respected colleague on the West coast regarding interest=
ing phenomena he and others are constantly observing in sites with phenomen=
a similar to that on Door to the Dead. None of those measurements were made=
 by this team. The use of thermal in this situation is not indicated as wel=
l.
=A0
The real concern is that no attempt was made to help this family in =
a broader context. The skeptic did and said nothing skeptical as far as I c=
ould tell. Key questions were not asked (at least on-camera) that would rev=
eal the psycho-dynamics of this family. We know fairly well at this time th=
at PK phenomena is often centered on a focal person who can exhibit specifi=
c characteristics. That the team seems unaware of this is quite disturbing =
to a person like myself.
=A0
A real research opportunity was lost in this c=
ase, as was an opportunity to educate the public on the right way to approa=
ch such situations. Continually sending the messages that phenomena is base=
d on 'demons' and 'spirits' exclusively does nothing to further the positio=
n of serious investigators, which is perhaps most troubling of all.
