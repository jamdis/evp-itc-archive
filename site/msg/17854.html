Ok, here is another kind of funny one, it's  really all in the same 
sentence, but since it was too difficult to understand, I  some how managed to 
separate them making them 2 files.  The first one is  someone saying to (who 
knows), that "Suzette, in Heaven" then this guy, tells  them to "shut up!" and 
how rude, then some other guy comes back in a singing  type sentence saying, 
"no! you shut up!"  Some people in those lower plains  or levels are 
probably jealous whenever someone gets out and gets into the light  or Heavens.  
Some that are "stuck" may be in jail yet or trapped there  maybe they need 
yet to develop a conscious for the harm they did while here on  Earth, then 
many are probably murderers and stuff too.  sf
