<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Zack,

My 3 minute drive is from the Colorado Springs lab where he was in 1899-
1900, I think.
It was on Knob Hill and I live in the Knob Hill section of Colorado 
Springs.
There are homes where his lab once was, and I&#x27;ve walked through the 
alley next to where the lab was a few times... just to be near where he 
did his fantastic work.
