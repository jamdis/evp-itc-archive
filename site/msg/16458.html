You should experiment with all of the above. Personally I prefer to go with=
out background noise. I like to be sure I am not matrixing something out of=
 nothing.

You only need to do protection techniques if you feel it necessa=
ry. I don't because I know I am always protected. I doubt you will ever run=
 into to a truly malevolent spirit. I have yet to encounter even a mildly g=
rumpy one LOL!

  Wow this is cool, thank you al=
l so much for answering my questions. Now, how should I begin? I have the r=
ecorder, do I need a noise source (like static or something) to get results=
? My goal at this point is to get one convincing sample to show my friend t=
hat I'm not crazy.

  I've read a few books, most state to say a prayer or =
something to that effect beforehand. Personally, I don't think there are "d=
emons" per se. Negative spirits, probably; but beings who are created just =
to be evil? No.

  Again, thank you!
