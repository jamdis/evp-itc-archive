<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey mister this is the kind of post I like! I&#x27;ve been apprehensive
about blogging here because if you don&#x27;t regularly upload your audio
files it results in being ostracized by a lot of participants here.
And the fighting amongst some people is discouraging also. But I
prefer video as you and some others know. So I quietly videotape
sessions and share them with other researchers who aren&#x27;t anxious to
pounce on anyone based on opinion or frequency of posting here.

 Suffice to say virtually every method of ITC is employed by me, and
call me obsolete if you want to but I still mainly use RVG maybe
because it&#x27;s what I have to work with even though most others embrace
sweep. I&#x27;ve got Hacked Shack and other commercial Boxes, but always
end up going to an early style Box with RVG only. It&#x27;s noisy, and
single mode, but it&#x27;s what I use most often anyway because of the results.

&gt; Hi all; There are alternatives;  1-EVPmaker, a free program that
runs on a PC and performs the same function as the box, that is it
provides the raw audio spirits/entities use to form voices. It is in
fact the inspiration for my boxes.  2-The Mini box by
paranormalsystems.com. It&#x27;s a direct output, linear sweep system based
on my boxes, and it does work.  3-Use the manual sweep mathod, take a
radio that can be tuned easily by hand, tune the dial up and down
slowly while recording directly from the speaker. Always announce you
are doing an EVP session before you start recording. Manual sweep was
the basis for linear sweep that the Mini box uses, and that I have
adopted for my boxes, and was first developed here on this group.  3-
Foreign language-Tune in a short wave broadcast in a language you
don&#x27;t understand, and record directly from the speaker of the radio.
You can also use an internet foreign language boroadcast for the same
purpose. See coffeepotghost.com for more information.  4-Radio between
stations as a source of white noise. I like to pick a night when there
lots of skip, stations fadding in and oput randomly, this is a great
source of raw audio. You&#x27;ll have ignore the critics that cliam you&#x27;re
only hearing broadcast fragments, you hav eto judge the result by
meaning, that is, does the message mean anything personally?   I&#x27;m
sure there&#x27;s other methods out on the web. I suggest peole start wiht
white noise, and work your way up. 
&gt;  
&gt;  There is nothing magical about the boxes, it&#x27;s a swept radio,
nothing more. It provides a higher level--louder--audio that spirits
use to make voices, that is all it does!   I usually do not ask
questions when I do sessions, I think that biases the mind into
expecting, and maybe even creating the answers one wants the hear. I
rely on the guides to give me what I need. I also don&#x27;t do
&quot;investigations&quot;, again I think it biases your mind into creating what
you want. I really doubt there is any haunting if no one is there to
experience it.   I know---what I say is to be dismissed as it doesn&#x27;t
jive with the Hollywood version of the paranormal.      Frank-S
