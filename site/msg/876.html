<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>on one megahertz, i had 2 old zenith transoceanics which would give 
out a persistent but weak one kilohertz tone when local 0ne meg 
station was nulled out and flywheel rocked slowly between 900-1100 khz

after awhile myriad weak voices would appear next to the 1000hz tone, 
which is the peak in hearing sensitivity of most humans AND the 
SQUARE ROOT of one megahertz which seems to imply a weak 
superregeneration with quench as square root of carrier.  this 
happens on no othe frequency only one meg.  it would be hard to 
automate because the min and max is random and determined by hearing 
the click of the spurious superregeneration kicking in.

on one occasion in 1986 i was fooling around with this and abruptly 
got full rendition of a 78 rpm version of judy garland singing over 
the rainbow and it was LOUD and extra extra clear.  i had time to run 
outside and conscript my wife as a witness before it switched off 
with a few indecipherable male voices and a click

&gt; right on, dave,
&gt; 
&gt; and i know what you mean, the desired voice seems to persist across 
&gt; several station hops.
&gt; 
&gt; i took the front off the radios and removed string and just grabbed 
&gt; the flywheel if plastic or bolted a non-conductive disc on it. the 
&gt; size of the flywheel seems about right for a slow enough sweep and 
&gt; you can hear voices stretching off each station when it works.  i 
&gt; never recorded or understood anything-just noted &quot;otherworldly 
&gt; feeling&quot; or spooky resonance of sounds.  right now i have a car 
radio 
&gt; with a toothpick jammed into sweep lever. 
&gt; 
&gt; --really interested in software now, though, alas.
&gt; 
&gt; if the spread spectrum is maxed in computer bios it has something 
of 
&gt; the same effect.

&gt; &gt; I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning 
system. 
&gt; I tried several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner 
&gt; through the AM band late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the 
&gt; dial moving at a constant rate of speed. This is not nearly as good 
&gt; as Frank&#x27;s &#x27;hands off&#x27; random tuning method but it still produced 
&gt; some results. What impressed me most is that some of the voices 
sound 
&gt; the same, even though I tuned through several channels. This 
attached 
&gt; capture could be a technical message.
&gt; &gt; &quot;Plug a million hertz&quot;   One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, 
which 
&gt; is close the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.
