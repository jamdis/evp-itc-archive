<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Using the foreign language method, where you tune in a foreign language you
don&#x27;t understand, then record using it as the raw audio, directly formthe
speaker. The idea being the entities manipulate the sound between the radio
and the recorder.

 in this one

 1-Lets have a look-ghost in house

 2-@ 4 seconds Contact his box

 3- @ 5 seconds -died in the bedroom house

 4- @ 7 seocnds I&#x27;m dead

 5-@ 10 seconds and to the end,  foreign language fragment I don&#x27;t
understand.

 So, I do live in a &quot;haunted house&quot; afterall--DOH! The tentents in the small
attached apartment report activity, such as things flying off the counter,
and being struck by unknown objects, nothing harmful thoguh.


 This was meant to do two things, show the method, and poke at the hornets
nest.
