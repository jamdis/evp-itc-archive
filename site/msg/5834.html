&gt; I have posted a direct recording in my file under RS12-469 Direct 
Recording.  This may be a good opportunity to get help with my 
technical challange here in Mexico.  I have posted what I recorded 
from AM signals along the beach here on the Gulf with the recorder 
patched directly into the RS 12 469.  Most channels are Spanish 
language although one or two channels skip across the Gulf 
fromTexas.  So you shouldn&#x27;t hear many English words from the radio 
if any.
&gt;    
&gt;   I am submitting this because, with the help of this group, I 
recently learned that I have been missing all the messages on my 
recordings.  That is...I couldn&#x27;t hear anything where others with 
experience hear plenty.
&gt;    
&gt;   My previous post was with EVP maker.  If somethng could be heard 
on the RS recording patched directly into my recorder that would be 
another amazing event for me.  I of course hear nothing from the 
other side.  Ron L
