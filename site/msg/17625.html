<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This morning I did some minimal testing of Chris&#x27;s Ghost Box 1 RS-12-589, and I must say I did get some good messages, that were so clear that I did not have to use Clear Voice at all on them. I actually tested it on a crime case.

I think I am going to really like this radio, but still have much more testing to do before I start using it with my clients.

I sent Chris a note as I am still trying to figure out what the toggle switch on top is for.

Chris if you see this note, please tell me what that toggle switch is, and I have a suggestion for your next radio.

Steve Hultay you may need what I suggest too.

The silver dial that controls the speed of the scan, if you can add a circle label underneath that displays 1/8 line increments in a circular pattern, so we can turn the dial to each increment. What this will allow the user to do is mark the line increment that works best for recording.

For me I need to be able to turn the device on and record for a client, and it will be hard for me to try and find that sweet spot every time I record.

I am going to see if I can find or make a sticker to place under the dial.

Again, so far I love it! Especially knowing I will likely not need to use Clear Voice or any other software to bring clarity.

I will keep you informed.
