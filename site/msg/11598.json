This was recorded at the farm I grew up on, where my\nbrother and his family now live.  My two nieces (age 17 and 21) have\nhad various occurrences there so we thought we&#39;d try out some of this\nnew stuff and see what we&#39;d get.  We got quite a few interesting\nresults I think.\n\nThis is part of one where we asked if they are there, and then how\nmany are there. This one was made with EVPMaker (the RS 20-125 didn&#39;t\nwork so well out in the country - maybe not enough noise/sounds for\nthem to use??)  The answer is &quot;We are at eight, Yeah, there are\neight.&quot;  I think it&#39;s pretty clear.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n~ Becca"}
