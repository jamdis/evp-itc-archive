I never quoted you. I was making the point that when you make statements su=
ch as "I just don't believe everything people tell me", you are basically c=
alling those people liars or frauds or whatever you want to call it! There =
are hundreds of files posted here that are the results members of this grou=
p have gotten during their sessions. If you listen to them, the results are=
 there. The members of this group are giving you the evidence to listen .=
=C2=A0
As an example, Frank related the contents of a session . I don't rec=
all him calling that information a personal prediction of his, yet you said=
 you were writing that down as one of his predictions. =C2=A0Please do not =
insult others and then be =C2=A0surprised when people are offended.

<div> Same old thing, =
heard them talking about "it hits the earth" again last night while testing=
 one of those single supply dual sweep boxes, so set up a hack radio I had =
handy. "--BehindTheSun--ComesFarFromEarth--(jack-frag)IsComin'--Session-Ear=

FM a rock station. Presumable 2012. The December 21st date from the Mayans =
seems to be a middle number, there's like a window right around Christ=
mas, as they seem to mention the 17th along with this stuff. Who knows if i=
t means anything, but what I don't like are those that profess to "know bet=
ter". </div>
