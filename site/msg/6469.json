Tom had explained to me that my EVP files where edited so therefore\r\nin his opinion useless and my services would be no longer needed.\r\n \r\nWhen I say edited I mean the volume was amplified because we were doing silent EVP in a silent room.\r\nHe suggested we ask a series of questions before the evp session and then turn the recorder on and let it run.\r\n \r\nI received numerous messages pertaining to the cases we worked on including names, places, dates and where the remains\r\nof the victim could be found. The evp files where discarded and never brought to light because tom and Lisa did not feel they where worthy\r\nbecause they had some of the static hiss removed and had been amplified.\r\n \r\nI tried repeatedly to explain that unless the disembodied spirit where grounded in the location and close proximity to the recorder how was it\r\npossible to catch class A+ evp's.\r\n \r\nWell to make a long story no longer,\r\nWe had a parting of the way's and I left the organization. I firmly believe that the Butlers would never be open to the idea of box research.\r\n \r\nBruce\r\nBruce Halliday \r\n\r\n\r\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.comFrom: lisby@earthlink.netDate: Tue, 29 Jan 2008 15:00:02 +0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Just A Little Spoiled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I'm glad to hear it, but as of last week, the leaders wereunreceptive to the idea that this phenomenon was real.Ann--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, \" RetroCom\" <vfp19968@...> wrote:>> There is a radio sweep forum on AA-EVP for members.
