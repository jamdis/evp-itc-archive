I will probably be at Horrorfest for some of this stuff. If you like, I can=
 pass your messages on to them in person,=C2=A0 and get their response to a=
nything.=C2=A0 If you like to send me some emails I can hand them to them a=
nd get responses.=C2=A0 And I could suggest they contact you for a setting =
where you all could get together and develop some tests, do some Q&A (on vi=
deo so you have proof if they blow you off or cheat) so that you can be abs=
olutely assured of that input?

Pardon me if I am reading your email incorr=
ectly though. I might be taking seriously some of your complaints and accus=
ations,=C2=A0 when all you really mean to do is vent.
