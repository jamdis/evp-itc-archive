Debbie, you can not scan with the new model.  I believe Bruce has a photo of the old gray (silver) model on his website.  You need the one in the cardboard box.

  Based on your comments about the 12-469, I'm going to pick up a 12-470 later today. I called our local Radio Shack and the guy insisted that the new 12-470 is exactly the same as the old one, just the case is a different color (grey & black). I specifically asked if the electronics were set up the same way and he said yes, they're exactly the same. Do you suppose he's right about that? Or just doesn't know the product that well?

            There is no pulsing on the older style 12-470, just clear 
communication. My 12-469 is sitting in the corner and i'll probably 
never touch it again because that constant pulse noise is very 
distracting to get past to hear any audible messages. That's just my 
personal opinion anyway for what it's worth. If you listen to my 
radio shack files from today you will hear the difference between the 
two boxes. The sweep between the two are both linear, but one has 
the pulse sound and one is just a clean sweep without the pulse. Ask 
your local radio shack if they have any 12-470 older style models, 
they are gray with a white top and also has a built in speaker. The 
new 470 is all black and can't be modified as of yet but i think Mike 
C. could figure it out if he didn't have 500 other projects going at 
the same time....lol Any questions just shoot me an e-mail and i 
will help the best i can.
