babiarz3,
 
I believe the posts you are referring to about family hour with=
 the box
where written in a light manner in jest. I do not presume to speak=
 for anyone 
else on this group I'm sure they can speak for themselves.
 
y=
ou speak of responsibility with any form of open communication, I believe t=
he individuals that are
studying and distributing the mini box are sufficie=
ntly experienced and know who they should sell to and who not.
 
I don't be=
lieve they mean to put the mini box on the shelves in toys r us. Anyone tha=
t uses a box whether it be a Frank's box
A Joe's box or a mini box will pro=
bably have done some research into this method of evp and will probably hav=
e some intimate experience
with the paranormal field and if not I'm sure th=
ey will seek advice from those of us that have that experience. There is ne=
ver a lack of advice here.
 
as far as dark heads go I know through persona=
l experience that they can be deceiving and manipulative with someone that =
does not know any better
I have a Frank's box and a Joe's box and do seriou=
s research on a daily basis. My opinion is the good spirits out weigh the n=
egative ones and anyone
that experiments with a box will tell you that you =
do forge strong bonds with what I call my spirit guides or technicians, the=
 same two spirits communicate 
with me during every session and protect me =
from negativity. As long as I do not feed the darkies with my own negativit=
y I am fine.
 
Also I believe that the people who are distributing the mini=
 box have set that price to deter any average person that's completely igno=
rant of the paranormal
away from purchasing this device.
 
I have never met=
 bill personally but know of him, he is a well respected researcher and is =
well aware I think of the pitfalls as well as the rewards of box communicat=
ion.
and I don't believe he would ever endanger himself, his family or anyo=
ne else by carelessly using the box for entertainment purposes.
 
that Is m=
y opinion for what it's worth.

I am a fairly quiet person, most of the time. I have my thoughts an=
dopinions on topics but feel strongly about "to each his own". Unlesssometh=

om me other than recently with this mini-box yet, I amhere several times we=
ekly reading and offering my energy in support ofthe research.However...som=
ething is striking me here and again, I can't keep mymouth shut. The discus=
sion about the family hour with the box has ledthe way for people to mentio=
n negativity and even "the dark guys" canbe fun if not taken seriously.I as=
k you to consider the fact that many who purchase the mini-boxwill not be o=
f the right frame of mind. Most will not be in harmony.Many will take "the =
dark guys" seriously. Yet, you feel it's a goodidea to let anyone who wants=
 a box have one? All in the name ofsharing technology.I know that my previo=
us posts expressing my concern over the massmarketing of the box, was barel=
y given consideration. Realize that Iam not being selfish- I do not own a b=
ox. EVP is my passion and hasbeen from day one 6 years ago when I jumped fu=
lly into the field. I amsuccessful in capturing EVP, always have been. I st=
ill do it the "oldfashioned way" with open air techniques. Would I love to =
be able tohold real time 2 way communications with the other side? Of cours=
e.However, I do not think enough research into the possibilities hasbeen do=
ne to warrant the approval let alone production of these boxes. Those of us=
 who have been on countless investigations with many peoplewill quickly adm=
it that there are some people we'd rather notinvestigate with. When they ar=
e present, negative things tend tohappen. We all know one or two people who=
 we can say "felt dark" fromthe first meeting. We all admit that being ment=
ally sound is animportant quality in this field. If you have mental issues,=
 this maynot be the area of research for you. We don't bring children oninv=
estigations for obvious reasons. BUT! If you want a box that couldpossibly =
open up a portal and bridge the gap between here and thedark, sure! Anyone =
who wants one should have it! You might feel that I am over reacting or bei=

that youconsider the possibilities here. Many of which we do not know. Can =
