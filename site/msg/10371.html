Sooooooo, I need to make a group for Transsexual paranormal 
reserchers, and we can all dress in drag and go do investigations athe 
local drag queen hotspot! That's about as close to like minded as I'm 
going to find on this planet! And that's about as serious as I'm 
getting on this subject!

Really, the only reason and purpose for EVP, ghosts, hauntings, 
paranormal.. .ect is to prove to the individual that life is forever. 
It's not so some bozo can get on TV, or charge megabucks for box 
readings. There is only one criteria for judging voices, what does it 
mean to you! If poeple want to get all critical, and take on aires 
over this crap, I don't have time for that BS!
