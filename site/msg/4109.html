<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m new to this group, but not to ITC research. I&#x27;m familiar with
spirit communications using boxes like Frank&#x27;s, the mini-box, and RS
hack. I&#x27;ve seen the picture of Frank with the mini-box. Frank, it
looks to me that you are promoting this mini-box. Is that correct? If
so, is it the only box that you are promoting now? Or are they just
using your image and a few of your statements to push their box? What
I heard of the C2C show it seemed to me that it was more of a
promotion for the mini-box. They posted something about that their box
has a cleaner signal and Frank&#x27;s box had more noise to it. Well,
sometimes in this line of work you want to have a little bit of
inherent noise. I know that the RS radio has to meet FCC Class B
regulations Part 15. As for being a cleaner signal, I would think that
the RS radio would actually be, than the mini-box. I have heard both
the mini-box and the RS hack and I can&#x27;t tell a lot of differences
between the two except for the price. It&#x27;s my understanding that the
mini-box is selling around $400 and that&#x27;s a lot of money for just a
AM radio. The RS radio is selling for $24.95 and I know people are
getting some great results with the RS hack. Just my two cents worth!!
