The way I look \nat spirit stuff is that we all continue, pretty much the same as we are now, \nbut more enlightened hopefully, but with bodies, and all. On those rare \noccasions that I actually see spirit, they have a bodies, just like in life. \nI think there&#39;s technology on the otherside, but since there been spirit \ninfinately longer than anything physical, it&#39;s so advanced that it just seem \nlike magic, and we, here have no comprehension of how it works.  I also have \nto wonder if maybe it&#39;s not just the developed mind over there, maybe they \nreach a point where they can manipulate our physical world with thought \nalone. That&#39;s like two avenues of conjecture that I ponder from time to \ntime.\n\nThere&#39;s so much, like what are orbs, and how do they work, as they seem to \ncause EVPs as well?\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n5.5%* 30 year fixed mortgage rate.
