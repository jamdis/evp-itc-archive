<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I tried this for the 1st time today.I am somewhat perplexed- is there any
way that the allophone files can randomly generate words... like &quot;bitch&quot; - I
am fairly sure I heard this a number of times, as well as other bits and
pieces? I have been experimenting with a few different allophone files that
have been slowed down. Evpmaker is pretty cool but I guess I am wondering if
I am just imaging what is being said??

Can anyone shed some light on this perhaps- how likely is it that the
allophone files can generate words etc?

:D


Thanks
