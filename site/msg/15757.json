I asked how many entities I was speaking to, and I got two different answers, both repeated twice:  1138 and 14.  Later on, I asked for them to say my mother&#39;s name.  The answer in quick clear succession:  Beverley, Stephanie, Jodie.  None of which, needless to say, are my mother&#39;s name.  Nor could they have been ANYBODY&#39;S mother&#39;s name (at least no one I would expect to talk to), as those are modern names.\n\nI also asked the main guy, Steve, if he knew he was dead, just to see what he&#39;d say.  The answer was a very loud, clear, &quot;Duh!&quot;  Which, if I&#39;m not mistaken, is not the type of language an 88-year-old would use, am I right?  So I&#39;m thinking this Steve is not who I believe he is.  \n\nI did get some evidence on the side of dead relatives, however.  My mom asked, &quot;Is there anyone there who knows me, can you say my name?&quot;  First I hear &quot;Steve,&quot; then my mom&#39;s name (Sally), and then, very clearly, &quot;Third.  Boy.  Red.  Love.  You.  Red.  Red.&quot;  My mom&#39;s cousin&#39;s nickname was Red, and we weren&#39;t entirely sure of this until we looked it up afterward, but he was indeed the third boy.  \n\nI also heard someone saying, all in one quick, short breath, &quot;Get away from me.&quot;  This was directly after Red.  Don&#39;t know what that was about, but it&#39;s the first negative thing I&#39;ve heard.  Well, earlier in the session, there was something that sounded like &quot;Death Rep&quot; three times in a row.  That was in response to the question, &quot;Are we speaking to Steve, yes or no?&quot;\n\nSo, I think during my next session I will try Frank&#39;s approach.  I will ask that they all speak together and identify themselves, and then I&#39;ll just let them go at it."}
