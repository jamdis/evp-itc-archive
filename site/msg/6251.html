You can disagree, I will let'cha! LOL I think this is a misunderstanding between us once again. The whole point of the communication is to bring about the spiritual evolution of mankind. To convince not us but others that their is an existence greater than the small petty worlds we have created around ourselves. They mean to increase our humanity, tolerance to change, and unconditional love for one another so that we can join that existence with comfort. The very same communications you are getting from Mike and Lisa, you are getting by way of influence through your spiritual connection to them and many others who remain silent.

It is our job to spread the word to as many that will listen of what we have learned. Not to just sit in our extra bedrooms, garages, attics or whatever and test different combinations of radios and misc circuitry. The positive messages are what is important not the equipment. We need to change people's attitudes.

Frank R.

Frank,

 

I have to disagree.

I believe they have a purpose for putting so much effort into relating this communication in the hopes

that we will strive to better the communication so as to get better and clearer messages that convey their precise intention.

 

Mike and Lisa have told me how difficult it is to transmit this communication and they have a sense of urgency in their messages

trying to make us sit up and take notice. 

 

I would hate to believe they do not care about the outcome of man kind and ignore our problems, no matter how petty they may seem

to a higher being. there has to be a method and an end to their means. I don't think they are participating in this miraculous communication for entertainment.

 

If I am misunderstanding your meaning, which has happened to us in the past. Please let me know.

 

Bruce

Bruce,

The powers that be on the other side can't even begin to relate to human rationality or our petty perspectives. The beings I am talking about know exactly what we are conversing about at the moment it is typed on the screen. With one thought of them they are aware of your presence. Them seeing us in not an issue...lol. We have their attention but for the most part they don't have ours (as in the human race).

Frank R.

LC,
 
I believe that is what our spirit friends are striving for,
to let mankind know there is something bigger than ourselves.
 
Maybe if the powers that be could hear that with their own ears from the other
side they may stop and take a breath of rationality.
 
As for the catalyst I think that is what we are meant to be!

Bruce,

It's going to take a major change for harmony, peace and elevated 
mindset to occur in mankind...major perspective change for sure. 
That will demand some catalyst to unite- transform minds IMHO.
