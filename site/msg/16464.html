Everyone has their own assumptions, expectations, and subjectivity.=C2=A0 =
Scientists realize this, and that is why they use the scientific method: to=
 control for their own human predispositions.

On your advice, I read more =
of her articles.=C2=A0 The one on EVPS: (http://www.hauntedamericatours.com=
/EVP/EVP/) does show her presumptions, and she=C2=A0 presents many of the i=
ssues and potentials for "false positives" that I assume all experienced EV=
P researchers already know of. =C2=A0 But she also comments to the claims: =
"My response 
                              to this is=E2=80=A6provide the =
evidence! "

So that would seem to me she would be open to a well-designed =
test to "show her the evidence".=C2=A0 So I will contact her, suggest this =
sort of test, and even suggest that experts from this group would help to d=
esign and conduct the test - maybe even Frank - and let you know what she s=
ays.
