Set-up a certain time to run sessions \nweekly.  Let&#39;s say you could do it Monday -Thursday at 10:00 AM for \nexample.  This way, an expectation is set and a plan is in order.  \nKeep recording small sessions and then analyze them.  Ask questions, \nsimple basic questions for responses each day.  Don&#39;t give up.  I \npesonally have noticed this has helped me and something is building \nwith the contacts and quality of the messages.  For me it began with \na staggered &quot;Yes,&quot; and other one words occasionally.  Now I am \nhearing sentences and very intelligable responses that I know are not \nradio bit coincidences.  The biggest help any of us can give you is \nto remain patient and continue experimenting, looking for not only \nwhat works for you, but giving those on the other side time to find \nyou and get a message or two across.  It will come - I am certain of \nit.\n\nFor some reason, the amount of audio bits seem to help with the \ncommunication, as I can tell...even when I have received EVP-like \nmessages above or over the audio bits in the background.  I do not \nunderstand why.  Here are two ideas I have for you to pick up more AM \naudio:\n\n1) Try an AM antenna booster (Radio Shack sells them.  I think Juli \nhas had some success with hers).\n2) You may try more than one hacked radio sweeping at different \nplaces on the band.  Pipe the audio through a mixer, and output it \nthrough amplified speakers or directly into the recorder.  This way, \nyou wil have audio bits throughout - even if you have to use 3 radios \nto do it.\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Laura   I am on the Yucatan peninsula.  The very tip of the \npeninsula is about a two hour drive for me.   Nowhere near \nBrownsville, Texas.  I need to fly out of here which usually takes me \nfrom Merida to Houston or Florida.

It probably \nmakes me feel a bit better if nothing is on the recording since I \ndon&#39;t seem to pick anything up anyway.  The &quot;Ask Bruce is a bit of \nsurprise only because I already did ask bruce.  He had suggested I \ntry a direct recording.  \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt;     This actually brings up a question about what Steve hears.  Is \nit possible that you are getting a message given to you at the time \nyou are listening to my recording which actually does not have the \nmessage?  I must say I am still overwhelmed from getting messages on \nthe other evp maker recording (that others hear).   My pea brain and \nbody are still processing that information.  \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt;     Laui asked:  I am in Campeche, Campeche, Mexico.  City of, \nState of.

This may be a good opportunity to get \nhelp with my technical challange here in Mexico.  I have posted what \nI recorded from AM signals along the beach here on the Gulf with the \nrecorder patched directly into the RS 12 469.  Most channels are \nSpanish language although one or two channels skip across the Gulf \nfromTexas.  So you shouldn&#39;t hear many English words from the radio \nif any.\n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt;     I am submitting this because, with the help of this group, I \nrecently learned that I have been missing all the messages on my \nrecordings.  That is...I couldn&#39;t hear anything where others with \nexperience hear plenty.\n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt;     My previous post was with EVP make r.  If somethng could be \nheard on the RS recording patched directly into my recorder that \nwould be another amazing event for me.  I of course hear nothing from \nthe other side.
