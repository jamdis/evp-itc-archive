I don&#39;t know\n&gt; &gt; Chris Moon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I have heard him on C2C and have read his opinions. I am\n&gt; &gt; always weary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of anyone claiming to be one of a &quot;chosen few&quot; and using fear to\n&gt; &gt; further\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their arguments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The fear-based reasoning&#39;s and omni-potent subterfuge employed by\n&gt; &gt; Mr. Moon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only tells me to ignore him and anyone else like him. There is no\n&gt; &gt; manual or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; class  this research is done by Joe-Schmo in his basement and\n&gt; &gt; therefore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open to many different interpretations and methodologies.

In fact he has yet to pay anything for the\n&gt; &gt; boxes he has,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or any of the other equipment he &quot;barrowed&quot;, such as the Sony\n&gt; &gt; pocket size\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cassette recorder, and Tarot CD, he still has. Moon is the one\n&gt; &gt; that claims\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only he, or a designated trainee can properly interpret the output\n&gt; &gt; of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box, despite the fact that I have stated numerous times that I\n&gt; &gt; made the box\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for anyone to use, and one&#39;s results are any no better or  \n&gt; &gt; supercede in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyway the results of anyone else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now when someone claims that these new system don&#39;t work, or only\n&gt; &gt; get the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evil spirits, and even open portals so demons, or what not can\n&gt; &gt; enter, they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are lying, and attempting to keep the use of any equipment, and\n&gt; &gt; methods of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirit communication for themselves. The motive being priofit,a s\n&gt; &gt; far as I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can tell. The portal thing is Hollywood! I use my equimpemt in my\n&gt; &gt; basement,.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and have sinece 2000, amnd have never expereinced anything I could\n&gt; &gt; call evil\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beside soem cussing, nakme calling voices, which is hardly  \n&gt; &gt; threatening\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except to maybe 13 year old girl.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I must point put, because of preivisou threats, that slander is\n&gt; &gt; stating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something in public about a person that is knowingly untrue. So\n&gt; &gt; for anyone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comptemplating such threats I can say only-- Bring It, I will have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything you own!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _____\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You keep typing, we keep giving.
