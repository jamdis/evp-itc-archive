I would guess it's very common because it's literally a spiritual-mental-em=
otional-physical energy drain.  For the last two nights I've been listening=
 to my hacked radios in my motel room, without recording, just to get in-tu=
ned with them.  I've gotten totally ovewhelmed with exhaustion both times, =
to the point of having to stop within 10 minutes.  I agree that it's not re=
lated to physical stamina.  The sessions are draining for them on the other=
 side too, right?  Do you recover from your tiredness momentarily or does i=
t take some time?  I've felt kind of "hung over" the next day, and the tire=
dness is lingering.

. Please remember I run marathons and have been a ham

  not certain why this i=
s happening. Just wondering if anybody has this
  problem.
