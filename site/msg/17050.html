Thank you , April. We wondered about that=C2=A0 as well. I just keep gettin=
g it is male. Jay said he saw a man standing behind him in the room when he=
 looked in the full length mirror but upon turning around, no one was there=
. I thank you for taking the time to respond!

Take every chance you get be=
cause some things only happen once...

Have you considered that it may just be energy, and not a sentient =
being?

It sounds like a typical poltergeist case.

I am open t=

Please, if anyone can help o=

Sincerely,
