&gt; Hey Mike, tell your Catholic friend that the Vatican, under John

&gt;  
&gt; Roman Catholics were
&gt; given the Church&#x27;s blessing yesterday to &quot;contact&quot; loved ones beyond
&gt; the grave. Leading Vatican theologian Father
&gt; Gino Concetti said it is no longer a sin, as long as mediums, 
fortune teller
&gt; and palmists are not involved.
&gt; The pronouncement
&gt; came after Italian magazine claims that contact with the spiritual 
world had
&gt; produced miracles. Father Concetti dismissed that,  but added: &#x27;We 
can
&gt; pray for our loved ones. They will respond in dreams and 
inspiration. In one
&gt; example, a grandmother advised a girl about her marriage choice in 
a dream. The
&gt; girl did not heed counsel and a grave problem developed. If we pray 
seriously
&gt; in a quiet place, with our hearts and our voices, the departed will 
express
&gt; themselves and advise us.&#x27;

&gt; Mail, 29-Nov-96)

&gt;  
&gt; Recently Father
&gt; Concetti, one of the most competent theologians in the Vatican, 
said in an interview:
&gt; &#x27;According to the
&gt; modern catechism, God allows our dear departed persons who live in 
an ultra -
&gt; terrestrial dimension, to send messages to guide us in certain 
difficult
&gt; moments of our lives. The Church has decided not to forbid anymore 
the dialogue
&gt; with the deceased with the condition that these contacts are 
carried out with a
&gt; serious religious and scientific purpose.&#x27;

&gt; The Pope explains to
&gt; us &quot;What actually happens to us at the moment of death?&quot;
&gt; This question has
&gt; occupied mankind for centuries. Jesus promised that a final 
judgment will come,
&gt; an all-last day. But what occurs to the souls of those who die 
before this
&gt; point in time?
&gt; Pope John Paul II
&gt; explained it in Rome
&gt; before pilgrims. He said:
&gt; &#x27;One should not
&gt; think life begins after death only with the final judgment. Quite 
special
&gt; conditions prevail after natural death. It concerns a transitional 
phase in
&gt; which the body dissolves and where the life of a mirror-image 
entity (the soul)
&gt; begins.&#x27;
&gt; &#x27;This entity is
&gt; equipped with its own consciousness and its own will, so that 
humans exist,
&gt; although they no longer possess a physical body.&#x27;
&gt; A member of the
&gt; international papal theological advises: &#x27;At the moment of death 
humans make an
&gt; enormous discovery. The soul does not only leave the body, but 
humans discover
&gt; the secret of time. Because it becomes timeless, steps into 
eternity.&#x27;

&gt; journal Bild, 1998 October 30 in an article, &quot;The moment of death;

&gt; To add to that.
&gt;  
&gt; Kay, since starting box research this past January, 2008, I have 
had one close friend already tell me the responses are nothing but CB 
or two way radio traffic, and another close friend who is devout 
Catholic said that I am speaking to the devil. Go figure. 
&gt;  
&gt; My wife listened to the recordings and says she can not hear the 
responses.
&gt;  
&gt; I no longer discuss box research outside the EVP/Paranormal 
friendships I have.
&gt;  
&gt; Its just like UFO&#x27;s. Some people believe they exist and others 
believe they are military test vehicles.
&gt;  
&gt; For the past week and a half, I have been assisting Juli in a 
missing person case, and have been doing the box recordings for her. 
I conected with the boy right away who has been missing for over a 
year, and the info he has given us is info only the police detectives 
know, as it has not been released to the press. The boy has answered 
every question posed to him.
&gt;  
&gt; Either you believe in spirit contact or you do not. Some people 
believe in God and others do not. 
&gt;  
&gt; It seems to me the people that do not believe in spirit contact 
whether through a medium, box devices or personal experiences, are 
those that have never had an experience.
&gt;  
&gt; I have had a handful since my youth and adult life, and from the 
first one I had, I was hooked and never looked back.

&gt; Hi Kay. Your boyfriend&#x27;s opinion is one of the reasons why I put 
great weight on relevance 
&gt; of content in a session. For example, when I recently asked for 
Rees&#x27; great uncle to say 
&gt; his name, and an immediate reply of &quot;It&#x27;s Chuck Clarke&quot; is heard 
(even though Rees 
&gt; referred to him as Charlie, both are nicknames for Charles) I think 
the odds would be quite 
&gt; astronomical of that being coincidence. Same goes for any of us 
asking a question, any 
&gt; question, and receiving a relevant response ... it would be highly 
unlikely for it to be from 
&gt; stray signals (of whatever flavor.) 
&gt; 
&gt; Then again, if he has trouble even hearing and/or agreeing on the 
content, it&#x27;s going to be 
&gt; hard for you to get him to view an answer as relevant, even when it 
is.

to 
&gt; &gt; hear anything. (He is a bit hard of hearing) he is saying what we 
are 
&gt; &gt; hearing is skip from a cb radio or skip in general. Any imput on 
this?
