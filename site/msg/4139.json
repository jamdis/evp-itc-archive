Ron&#39;s personally going to be bringing to my \nnew Mini to the DAPS group meeting next Tuesday!! \n\nI&#39;ve heard such positive feedback, from him and others, I can&#39;t wait \nto start experimenting. \n\nAs positive communications with the Mini are established, I&#39;ll make \nsure other researchers are in the loop. \n\nLance \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;April Slaughter&quot; &lt;aprilrebuilt@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On the specs side, the MiniBox has controls for both scan rate as \nwell\n&gt; as sensitivity, so you can cut down on the amount of random noise \nand\n&gt; also find a speed which seems clearer, whereas you cannot with the \nRS\n&gt; Hack (as far as I know). The rechargeable battery lasts about 40-50\n&gt; hours on one charge... nothing to replace that way. It has both a\n&gt; speaker output and one for a recorder so you can not only hear it as\n&gt; loud as you like, but you can directly record your session from the \nbox.  \n&gt; \n&gt; When it comes to audible differences, the quality of the electronics\n&gt; used provides clearer sound. I am not straining so much to hear\n&gt; things. It is just speculation on my part, but it seems to take less\n&gt; time and less effort for communication from the other side to come\n&gt; through with the Mini. At least, in my experiences with both \ndevices.\n&gt; Though, I have gotten snippets from the RS Hack that were \nimpressive.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~April \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi April   Can you be more specific on the &quot;marked differences&quot;   \nron\n&gt;"}
