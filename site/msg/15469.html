Hi Frank,
Did you get this message?  They were asking for you, this was a few  days 
ago, over my radio the RS 20-125 they sound very clear to me, didn't say  
what they wanted maybe I can go through the recording, and see what else they  
are saying.  They like to watch baseball sometimes on my big screen, had a  
whole group of them here last weekend, for fun I asked them where they were 
in  the house, they said "all around" and "4 are sitting on the floor,"  I  
said, well I must walk right through you people then, they said "yes" I 
asked  them if they felt any sensation, they said they do feel when we walk 
through  them.  I always ask them if they want football or baseball, they say  
"baseball"  I had one spirit fella here routing for Seattle, it was  the 
Tigers _Mariners  game, since I'm not much into sports, I wasn't really  sure if 
it was a rerun or not, but they seemed to be happy, when I went into my  
room to work, I could hear them in the front room chatting amongst  
themselves.  Sometimes it's neat to have company out here, and I don't even  have to 
feed them.  Would you know anything about who the fella is in the  second 
one?  He is saying "save a company."
Bonnie
