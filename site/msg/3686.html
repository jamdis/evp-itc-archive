Apology accepted!

[Darth Vader Off]

Hey Bruce, I totally get that we all stress out and sometimes allow 
our a**holes to overide our mouths. That&#x27;s only human after all. 
Misunderstandings and consequential war of words happen, when we 
choose to feed into it. 

I&#x27;m just SUPER excited to actually have a MiniBox on order. It&#x27;ll be 
my pleasure to share my own findings for peer review as they present 
themselves. 

Ciao,
Lance

&gt; Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; this is for the entire group. After reading Steve&#x27;s post it dawned 
on 
&gt; me that he is 1000% right in saying that this has gotten out of 
hand.
&gt; 
&gt; I do not personally know Chris moon and any slurs I have made upon 
&gt; his character I apologize. I do not agree with the statements he 
made 
&gt; about box research and the people that are doing it, even though I 
&gt; may not agree with what he Say&#x27;s but I have shed my blood for his 
&gt; right to say it.
&gt; 
&gt; to babierz and lance, forgive my fowl language and the name calling 
&gt; sometimes my temper runs way ahead of my brain. 
&gt; 
&gt; in closing let me say it is the Christmas season and I for one will 
&gt; try to adhere to the old saying &quot;good will toward men&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; lets continue our research with no animosity.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks
&gt; Bruce
