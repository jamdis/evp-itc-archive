<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My question is more on a technique for separating out the word &quot;sounds&quot; from the
generic background white noise, as used to provide audio raw material for an
EVP session e.g. perhaps the spirit/entity/ET/ etc could help by prefixing their
word response with a &quot;number&quot; sound e.g.
operator : &quot;is anybody there ?&quot;
spirit/entity/ET/...: &quot;1,(one)yes&quot;
in this way a response is tagged to a number sound, (which could be programmed
into the voice recognition software i.e 0-9 ?)
so helping to distinguish it from the inherent background noise generated as the
ghost box cycles through the radio bands...anyway its just a thought.
Personally it seems to me from listening to the ghost box sessions via audio
clips and you tube videos that Spiricom like transmissions are still a long way
off.

Now is it just me,
I read Mark Macys account concerning the work ITC groups on the &quot;other side&quot;
supposedly involved with the worlds greatest minds in electronics, advocates for the technology when earth side - now passed on- to build a communication bridge between the worlds, The Spiricom
being something of a watershed device and a technological marker of better
things to come back in the day, well by 2009 I  was expecting something
stupendous I mean Arena Prog rock concert scale here 
well hmmm do they have trade unions on the other side, cause they must be on a
work to rule or 3 day working week with extended liquid lunch breaks or maybe
this delay is down to a mix up with relative time lines within the multiverse
as aside from some interesting accounts seeming to demonstrate adeptness with
utilizing most if not all electronic devices of that time (80&#x27;s) where nothing
was really safe from ghostly tampering e.g. washing machines, TV, and you gran
mama (recently deceased) is on the telephone wanting a word etc,  only very recently with advent of the &quot;Ghost box&quot;, has progress been made and that is down to the endeavors of talented radio hobbyists looking for a new technical challenge.
So Mr Macy what has happened to the technical progress when the knowledge base of the 7 Ethereal gatekeepers together with the growing band of (deceased in a sense) geniuses cannot move on the design as demonstrated by the spiricom device?

and on that point, why isn&#x27;t there a spiricom like email gateway service,
seriously, we are in the Internet age and spirit people- circa 20 years ago
were already  sending  rubbish emails and dodgy fax montages (like us all,back then) and that was using crappy dial up over a PSTN line!, so ITC sprit world, hey common
it&#x27;s all digital now!!, Broadband is here already (even in the UK)  Robot voice synthesizers over PSTN lines where de-rigur in spooking the life out of some unsuspecting ITC believers way back in the 70&#x27;s but now that we have computers on our phones for voice mail, it seems no ones calling home anymore?
(but should I receive a reply over either email or phone to the above by what I
think is the &quot;other side&quot; I will post it on this forum ;) 
all the best, D

&gt; Generally, voice recognition software requires the user to go through several training phases with it before using it, so the software is able to recognize that particular users words (unless it is a VERY limited set of words). So with this kind of software, it would be hard to create an objective training session to pull a voice sequence out of noise from a voice that it has never heard. The software would make a lot of mistakes, and perhaps even be subject to paradolia, just like people.

&gt;       hello,
&gt; 
&gt; does anyone know of a system which can fix a voice wave form out of the background noise e.g a ghost box combined with voice recogntion software so that EVP responses are automatically registered (on the screen) so that even if consiously the operator may miss audio responses due to the background noise the machine/PC audio sensitivity will not ?
