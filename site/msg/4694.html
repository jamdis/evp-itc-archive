<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Zack,

I&#x27;m hoping I can get some help from Frank S since he lives close to  
me. If that doesn&#x27;t work out for some reason, I&#x27;d be glad to mail the  
camera to you if you (you&#x27;re not in New Zealand or something?), pay  
you for your work and shipping for return. Would that work?

&gt; Hi Debbie,
&gt;
&gt; What everyone else has said is correct. OUCH! The pc board is now
&gt; damaged.
&gt;
&gt; I can&#x27;t quite tell how bad it is from the photo. It might be  
&gt; repairable
&gt; but probably not with the original connector. That would have to be
&gt; removed and the wires soldered directly to the board. The board itself
&gt; would have to be repaired also, by someone who has experience in  
&gt; repairing
&gt; such things.
&gt;
&gt; I could probably do that, as I worked in electronics repair for over  
&gt; 10
&gt; years, but I live quite a ways from you.

&gt; &gt; Okay, one of my DIY projects this weekend has been to convert my
&gt; &gt; husband&#x27;s old Olympus to infrared. We&#x27;re not extremely talented in  
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; electronics area, but we have fun and seem to muddle by. No guts no
&gt; &gt; glory, huh?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, for the most part the operation has been a success. I
&gt; &gt; photographed every step of the way and taped screws and parts to the
&gt; &gt; photos so we&#x27;d know how to rebuild everything we took apart, and  
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; has worked just fine. I located the IR filter, removed it and cut  
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; replaced it with a piece of glass slide.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The one problem we ran into is that there were two wires that  
&gt; appeared
&gt; &gt; to be clipped in place as opposed to being soldered or screwed in  
&gt; like
&gt; &gt; everything else. When we tried to pry the clips open, instead the
&gt; &gt; whole thing came off the circuit board. WE HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO  
&gt; PROCEED
&gt; &gt; FROM HERE. I don&#x27;t know if we can just glue the darn things down and
&gt; &gt; if so, what type of glue to use, or if we&#x27;re just plain up the  
&gt; creek.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I immediately thought of this group of brainy electronics buffs. I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; hoping someone out there can give us some advice, or if you live  
&gt; near
&gt; &gt; Highlands Ranch, CO, you could help in person &amp; bail us out of  
&gt; this. I
&gt; &gt; was hoping to take this camera to the St. Augustine Lighthouse at  
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; end of this coming week.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there any hope? I&#x27;ve posted a photo of an extreme closeup of the
&gt; &gt; clips (one is pink, the other is ivory) and the damaged board -- I  
&gt; had
&gt; &gt; to sandwich two photos together to get both in focus at the same  
&gt; time
&gt; &gt; (that&#x27;s why it looks that way). For an idea of scale, the clips are
&gt; &gt; both the same size, about 4 mm in width, 4 mm tall, 3 mm deep. Not
&gt; &gt; easy to handle and even harder to see with these middle age eyes.
