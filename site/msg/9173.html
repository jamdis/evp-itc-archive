<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I understand, Kay.  As I mentioned earlier, ordinarily I would just send a private message 
to people on eBay when I saw something crazy going on, but about 2 weeks ago 
(guessing) eBay disabled the ability for anyone but the seller to contact bidders, due to all 
the scammers out there trying to rip off people.  

Kind of a bummer, but as a buyer, I appreciate the protection, as I&#x27;ve received many bogus 
offers in the past and found it quite annoying.  

I&#x27;ve never sold anything on eBay, or Craigslist, so don&#x27;t know the ins and outs of it all.  I&#x27;ll 
leave that up to you experienced folks to list whatever, if that is what you choose to do.  If 
not, that&#x27;s OK too!  :-)

&gt; Hi Margaret 
&gt;    
&gt;   Yes I saw what Frank and Bruce wrote I am taking it all in, trying to figure the best way 
to handle this. I know some are opposed to doing anything and some are for it. And of 
course being a newbie to both the group and evps I respect what everyone has to say. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Think I am going to sleep on it and look more into it tomorrow. And as a group figure 
out what is best for all.  I think I personally got caught up in the hype of seeing someone 
sticking it to so many people.

&gt;   Hi Kay. Just wanting to make sure you saw Frank&#x27;s post. His concern being that we 
might 
&gt; wipe out the 12-469 availability. Maybe you could mention all the models, or none of 
&gt; them (just be more generic in the ad). This way, people can be drawn to one model or 
&gt; another naturally, rather than being guided toward the 12-469 (which honestly, I think 
the 
&gt; click-click-clicking on the new version is a distraction). 
&gt; 
&gt; If I were to start from scratch, looking at all the choices, I would have gone with the 12-
&gt; 820 first. It&#x27;s great that additional models have been discovered to be hackable. Thanks 
&gt; much to those who have brought this information to our attention!

&gt; &gt; Here is a mock ad I made to put up on ebay. Let me know what you 
&gt; &gt; think and please any addtional information or editing on the ad is 
&gt; &gt; welcome. I will also put it on craiglist or anywhere else that will 
&gt; &gt; be helpful ...

&gt; &gt; MAKE YOUR OWN GHOST BOX
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can make your own Ghost box that functions similar to a Frank&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; box, Joe&#x27;s box and the Mini box. All you need to do is go to your 
&gt; &gt; local Radio Shack and pick up the 12-469 Digital AM/FM Pocket Radio 
&gt; &gt; for ONLY $24.99 plus tax and with a simple modification. You will 
&gt; &gt; have your very own cheap alternative to a &quot;GHOST BOX&quot;.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; (I will insert a picture of the RS 12-469 here)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This simple modification lets the radio sweep both the AM and FM 
&gt; &gt; band. Instead of it scanning and stopping on a station, doing the 
&gt; &gt; modification (clipping the &quot;Mute&quot; pin) lets it just sweep the entire 
&gt; &gt; band, without stopping on any station. Just hook your Radio up to 
&gt; &gt; some speakers or headphones and while the radio is sweeping the 
&gt; &gt; bands start asking questions and get answers in real time. You can 
&gt; &gt; also record it and review it later for answers you may have missed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There are several sites for the FREE instructions on how to modify 
&gt; &gt; your Radio Shack 12-469.
