I totally agree, Tim. This is a complicated issue. Spirit seems to be able =
to know our thoughts prior to our speaking, as well so if a Spirit might wa=
nt to trick or endear themselves to the communicator, then there is a possi=
bility of misinformation or lying. =C2=A0If as researchers, we are only att=
empting to establish that Spirit Communication actually exsists, then we mu=
st be more generalized in the questions we ask. If one has a topic on their=
 mind or a need to have specific information given to them, the research wi=
ll automatically become questionable, IMO.

I would be cautious accepting responses from a box as gospel.  I have had c=
ontradictory responses about religion come through, but then again, I align=
 myself much closer with atheism than christianity.  



Many times I feel =
that the boxes tell us what we want to hear.  Why? I could not tell you.  I=
t could be spirits playing with our heads, or, it could be a piece of our u=
nconscious coming through the radio.  This does happen, I have recorded the=
 voices of people in the same room with me coming through with the same spe=
ech patterns (although this happened twice with a Shack hack but I haven't =
had it happen with my Minibox yet).  



So in short, if you ascribe to a b=
elief and keep asking pointed questions about that belief over and over, do=
 not be surprised when you hear what you believe coming through the box.
