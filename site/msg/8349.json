The best part is definitely\nthe phrase &quot;I&#39;m at the talk therapy group.&quot; Obviously the `guysï¿½ do have\na sense of humor...\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Thanks so much for the SJ Allophones files, Stefan!\n&gt; I got an amazing response - well, amazing to me, anyway ;0) - right off the bat.  \n&gt; Just posted my first file ever to the forum.
