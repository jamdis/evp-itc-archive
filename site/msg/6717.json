You create the boxes but get no help usin=\r\ng them.   I wonder about the usefulness of the information as well, and the=\r\n fact that something talks that shouldn&#39;t be there is what intrigues me too=\r\n.  The multiple-level theory makes absolute sense.  I would like to believe=\r\n we&#39;re communicating with angels rather than devils, but that&#39;s obviously n=\r\not the case, at least not always.  Personally, I want this to be proof of l=\r\nife after death rather than proof of extraterrestrials or nature spirits or=\r\n demons, and the fact that I may never know might drive me crazy eventually=\r\n.   \n\nRobin\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \n  From: purplespacefriend&lt;mailt=\r\no:purplealiengirl@...&gt; \n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&gt; \n  Sent: Saturday, February 02, 2008 9:17 PM\n  Subject: [EV=\r\nP-ITC] Re: File from tonight\n\n\n  I have noticed a disturbing trend of box u=\r\nsers to develop what \n  appears to be an ego based &quot;mission&quot; that seems to =\r\ncoincide with \n  these supposed technicains.
