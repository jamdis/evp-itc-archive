<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>For those who are fairly new to box research and RTSC, i will provide
below a list of hackable radios to be used for ghost box sweep
functions.

Radio Shack Radios:

1. 12-469 (White-New Style). This the most popular one out there,
it has AM and FM on it. It does not have a speaker built in, but can
be used with an external speaker or earbuds.

2. 12-469 (Gray and White-Old Style Model). Same functions as the
newer one, but without the clicking during the sweep. This model is
outdated and is harder to find.

3. 12-470 (Gray and White-Old Style Model). Same as the 12-469, but
with a speaker built in. This is also hard to find, do not but the
newer model (Black) it will not work.

4. 20-125 . This model has AM/FM and Shortwave, it also has a built
in speaker. I feel the AM sweeps slowly in my area, but may work
differently for others depending on the strength on the radio signal.

5. 12-820 . This is an armband radio, which is AM and FM. This
model works pretty well, but does not come with a speaker. Must be
used with and external speaker or earbuds.

6. 12-850 . This model is AM and FM and has a speaker built in.

Non-Radio Shack Radios:

1. Sony Walkman (model #SRF-M37V). This is available at most stores
like Best Buy or Circuit City. No hack involved, just put batteries
in it and hold down the sweep knob. The only problem is that you
have to manually hold the button down to sweep. It also needs an
external speaker or earbuds.

2. www.paranormalsystems.com --- They have many different ghost
boxes available to purchase.

3. Manual Sweeps . This is one of my favorite ways to to do a
session. Take any radio at all with a dial and manual sweep from one
end of the band to the other while asking questions. Sometimes i ask
a question and than sweep to avoid a radio distraction during my
questions. This will work for anybody on any radio you may have,
it&#x27;s the best way to start out to see if RTSC is for you.

4. EVP Maker w/allophone file

5. www.digitaldowsing.com ---The ovilus, puck and other methods to
buy.


Well, i think that should bring new people up to date on their
options. Any questions, just e-mail me for hack info on a particular
model.
