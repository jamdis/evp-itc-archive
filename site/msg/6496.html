<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve heard of something called AM DXing.  Not that familiar with it
though.  Somehow you are supposed to be able to boost your signal
without any external device such as a Select-A-Tenna.  I need to read
into it further.  

I am very seriously considering buying a Select-A-Tenna.

&gt; I understand that sun interference would affect the day signal and a
big factor is radio stations in the u.s. can boost their signal
strength in later hours.  Might be urban legend.

&gt;  
&gt; Quite a few researchers get better reception at night.
&gt; I believe that is due to the fact that less signal traffic 
&gt; generally at night than during the day. consiquently that will 
&gt; allow for the weaker signals to be picked up.

&gt; 
&gt;       Bruce, I will definitely ask about the name Tim and about a
tech. The
&gt; &quot;very bored&quot; part, at least if I&#x27;m hearing it correctly, proceeds as
&gt; soon and the name &quot;Tim&quot; is ending and is at a lot lower decibel level.
&gt; Could be one of those things meant for me to hear, as in I was boring
&gt; them. It&#x27;s any body&#x27;s guess.
&gt; 
&gt; I got better reception as I did the session at around 8:45pm. 
&gt; Nighttime seems better for reception around here.

&gt; &gt; Jeremy,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I hear the &quot; TIM&quot; very clearly but not the &quot; VERY BORED&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Tim may be your assigned technition, next session ask for
&gt; conformation about
&gt; &gt; a permanant tech and who Tim is.

&gt; &gt; Now that I&#x27;ve listened to it some more, I think I hear more stuff,
&gt; butI&#x27;m not sure what. Maybe &quot;Tim&quot; right after I ask to repeat then
&gt; the&quot;very bored&quot; and something else. Any opinions?Jeremy--- In
