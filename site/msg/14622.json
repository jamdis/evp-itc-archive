It \n&gt; could possibly be  STIFF..  Can’t be sure though.  As for the longer 2nd  clip \n&gt; I can really only hear the whisper that says YES right before you state  “you\n&gt; ’re gonna go now”. I know there was someone trying to communicate because  \n&gt; there were a couple times I heard something but it was indiscernible to  \n&gt; me.   \n&gt; k \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; ____________________________________\n&gt;  \n&gt; From:   &lt;ST1&gt;EVP-ITC@y   [mailto:  [mailto:&lt;ST1&gt;E  ] On Behalf Of Not given\n&gt; Sent: Friday, May 22, 2009 6:12  PM\n&gt; To:   &lt;ST1&gt;EVP-ITC@y  \n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] What do you think part  2\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; thanks  for the feedback btw in the first one did you hear around 15 \n&gt; seconds ..  thanks?\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyhow here is the rest of that piece.
