No gravity-particle has been discovered (graviton?). But there are theories=
 about gravity being a particle, or a bend in space-time, or a wave, or a l=
ot of things.=C2=A0 Science is still grappling with this.

Yes; if it happened now it would be visible 500=
 years from now. If it happened 500 years ago, it would be visible now.

However, there are people including Greg Hodowanec who have collected s=
ome evidence that gravity waves are near instantaneous, and that if a super=
nova occurred now, it could be detected now. Still, we wouldn't SEE it for =
500 years. And=C2=A0the equipment=C2=A0described by Hodowanec (which I've b=

Fiona,

Sorry to butt in, but I'm curious. If this=
 is happening 500 Light Years away from us, doesn't that mean it will be vi=
sible to us in 500 years? I know that there is a delay with sound such as t=
hunder, then the delay before an individual hears it depending on how far t=
hey are from where the sound originated. Wouldn't it be the same with light=
?
