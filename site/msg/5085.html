Maybe they just dont have a name. Some entities never were human or had "names". I have had a few that others have given names or used terms for them.
   
  Just a thought.

From what I can discern from mike and Lisa's communication regarding techs/guardians
is that a tech is assigned to a researcher here on earth based on their compatible energy and harmonic vibration.
That is not so easy to do, so every time you do a session there is a temp assigned for that particular session.
 
Give it some more time and keep asking but I'm sure when you do get yours it will be a special relationship.
 
In other words you have to kiss the exact right frog for him to turn into your prince aah or princess 
 
I will keep the subject open with mike and Lisa until I get a definitive answer or you do.

      Hmmmm. That second bit gave me the creepies, I must say. What are your thoughts on that, Bruce? I hear Lisa's name at least a dozen times each time I run a session, so I feel confident that she is there, so I feel confident that I'm not in the hands of someone I don't want to be in. Maybe they are still auditioning for the role?
