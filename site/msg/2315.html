I agree Travis!!

also sells the K2 Meter on his site. I dont know why some people 
think its something that can especially enable one to contact the 
other side. Its an emf reader, Im not trying to be negative or 
anything. Im just pointing out its an EMF reader instead of having a 
digital/number indicator it uses lights. You can take a numbered EMF 
reader and accomplish communication that way also. All I am saying is 
if you are the type who wants this but has to make a choice of having 
money to eat for the next week or buy the meter, use what you have 
available to you. I have had successful two way communication using 
toys believe it or not. Where you ask a question set toy off once for 
no twice for yes, and its worked. 
I think if there is someone willing enough on the other side to 
speak to you, they are going to do it regardless of the device. If 
they are intelligent enough theyll find a way to establish 
communication. Of course sometimes you can pick up stray voices where 
they may not trying to communicate to you, you just capture it. So 
there are all kinds of communication, well all know that. So no Im 
not saying the k2 is a rip off by no means, Im sure you can use it to 
establish communication, I have friends who have the meter and swear 
by it. Im just saying if you have a regular numbered EMF reader you 
can use that as well if you are needed the cash you have. Regards,
T.L.

I have to say that it is a very affordable meter and very rugged. I 
am by no means a professional in this field, but I have to say that 
it is by far one of the most useful pieces I carry. The company is K 
II (2) enterprises, I got mine off of ebay and had it in about 3 
weeks do to back log in production. I hope this helps.

work or video ITC work you have no recognizable voice or image to 
positively correlate who the communication is coming from. In my 
case, I might ask the question "Are you Sylvia, my mother, show me 
two spikes for yes and one spike for no" and the meter will spike 
twice for yes, but I have no voice or image I would recognize to 
verify that is who is causing the meter to spike. The meter is a 
very useful tool and I do not conduct an investigation or session 
without it by my side, but like the rest of the tools in this field 
it has its valuable points as well as negative points.
