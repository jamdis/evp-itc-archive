Thanks Carol. Im sorry we dont have more space for files. Most of us tend t=
o attach to email posts or use esnips.com but hoping one day they upgrade t=
he group space size rather than worry about how their main page looks =3D) =
We only get 100 megs to share between everyone, but we make do using other =
alternatives.
