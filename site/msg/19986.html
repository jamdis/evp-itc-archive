=C2=A0
What I mean about "them" using=C2=A0anamolies, fluctuat=

=C2=A0

Now with saying that I love my boxes and I get=

It looks lik=

=C2=A0
It seems this device is trying to establish a =
very=C2=A0loose set of "controls" for capturing and validating EVP, but in =
my opinion this is the WRONG thing to do in some ways...I think "they" need=
 anomalies, fluctuations and variable conditions for the best communication=
 possible=C2=A0(something box-work provides them, and abundantly at that!).=
 
=C2=A0
Since working with the boxes I don't think I could ever go back to=

=C2=A0
Where the sweeping radio functions=

=C2=A0
Box work just=C2=A0feels=C2=A0a lot more proact=
