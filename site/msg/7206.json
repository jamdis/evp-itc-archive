My mind does this too, and you begin wondering if you \nare just nuts.  Then, you record a message that is mind blowing and you \nthink, &quot;This just may be working.&quot;  LOL  I understand, Steve, and am \nwith you... ;)\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanx to those who listened to my recent posts and it really brings \n&gt; that question up again &quot;Are we really Hearing This ??&quot;.  If everybody \n&gt; hears something different, than who&#39;s right?  I post what i think i \n&gt; hear and than when others hear something else, i can hear that too.  \n&gt; Why didn&#39;t i hear it the first time?  Also, until a clearer format \n&gt; becomes available to our spirit friends we will forge ahead with what \n&gt; we have.  It&#39;s very frustrating to say the least, i don&#39;t hear what \n&gt; others hear and they don&#39;t hear what i do.  It&#39;s a giant circle of \n&gt; confusion and mis-understanding.  Maybe it&#39;s just radio gibberish, \nwhen \n&gt; set at a certain speed makes our mind wander...who know&#39;s...right??\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
