Frank,
 
After doing box research for a while now and having the opportunit=
y to work with several different
types of boxes. I would have to agree the =
boxes are meant for and work better as a stationary communication device 
s=
ort of like a communication station that is consistently under the same bas=
ic conditions. I have never taken my boxes out of my home
or done a session=
 out side of my home and I don't believe that taking the box , any box not =
just yours to a remote allegedly haunted location
will not serve to enhance=
 communication. And if anyone is really concerned about summoning dark enti=
ties they have a much better chance
of that communicating with a grounded a=
nd maybe disgruntled or confused entity at a haunted location.
 
so I agree=
 with your assessment of box use 100%

This 'negati=
vity' is bad enough, I wouldn't even want it on the group except Moon is th=
e one that says everyone else,  me and the group included, gets only 'false=
 communcation' or 'bad guys', and that's from his own friggin' blog, I didn=
't make that up, or pull it out of my butt. So it effects us all, and I thi=
nk is open for discussion/comment knowing this will get forwarded back to h=
im. In fact I'll cc Moon this posting.   When he says all these scan radio =
users, that means me to, since I use the things, and I prefer the linear sc=
an mode. What I say about the box use is completely disregarded, and what I=
 get through the box, myself, as The Box Maker, is minimalized by Moon. Moo=
n puts my name out there connected with his so called 'telephone to the dea=
d', and I very much disapprove of my name being applied to an unauthorized =
use of my equipment. I don't give a crap what he gets through the boxes, or=
 does with it, but don't make it look like I designed it specificaly as the=
 'telephone to the dead', I designed it as a friggin' ITC device, that is c=
apable of two way communication--SOMETIMES, it's not like it's a guarenteed=
 connection, and you can't just dial up anyone, anytime, that's an exagerat=
ion! The "box" was intended by me to be used in a fixed location, just by t=
aking it to a GHU, or an "investiigation" is using it in a way I did not in=
tend, and I still say it's better if used in one place. All guide lines I h=
ave offered for box use are completely ignored, not just by Moon, to be fai=
r.     It has been shown that many different approaches work for this commu=
ncation, I suggest Moon design and build his own 'telephone the dead' and l=
eave my name out of it.     Frank-S
