&gt;   Sorry to hear that Frank. I can think of plenty of actual researchers
&gt; who would love to test one and are already getting great results with other
&gt; methods and versions of your work. I am also sorry I didnt make it very far
&gt; past the second paragraph. Karen obviously does not research before she
&gt; writes her articles.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;However, the precise location of the Sanatorium is a closely guarded
&gt; secret.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Ummm Karen needs to learn to use Google as well. If she had she would have
&gt; been able to print out a map to Waverly which includes information such as
&gt; tracks, businesses, adresses AND golf courses at the corner.  It even shows
&gt; you an overhead view of each building you pass along the way on each street.
&gt; Hint to Karen click sattelite view after you explore closeups of map view.
&gt;
&gt; Im sorry but if you are going to write a well informed article the first
&gt; step is become well informed. I wont bother reading the rest of her articles
&gt; because I wont waste my time looking at research from someone who cant
&gt; bother to cover the basics like look at a map before you drive out to
&gt; someplace you&#x27;ve never been before and then misinform people that it is in a
&gt; secret location. Nor do I see walking on a tour as as actual &quot;investigation&quot;
&gt; .
&gt;
&gt; Alot of the people once believed the earth was flat, unfortunately they
&gt; were not &quot;well informed&quot; and they too were victims of shoddy research.
&gt; Luckily there are those who do look beyond the horizon and open their minds
&gt; to the possibility that there is more out there.
&gt;
&gt; Happy New Years everyone and may your journey next year be in the right
&gt; direction!
&gt;

&gt;  I was lead to believe this person had an interset in the box, and she
&gt; brought her &quot;boyfirend&quot; that just happen to be local, to our meeting the
&gt; other day. I let them &quot;barrow&quot; #63, now  I&#x27;m sure she will claim she tested
&gt; the box &quot;scientifically, and can prove it does not work.
&gt;
&gt;  Karen had contacted me via e-mail requesting a meeting. I thought she was
&gt; someone off the group and has an interest in EVP and the boxes. She did
&gt; mention she was a skeptic, but I didn&#x27;t think debunker, or a professional
&gt; skeptic--wonder who pays these twits?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  These skeptics don&#x27;t allow themselves to hear anything, yet will proclaim
&gt; that as proof the boxes and EVP don&#x27;t work, as if their hearing is somehow
&gt; better than the average persons ear. If a person doesn&#x27;t want to hear it,
&gt; they won&#x27;t, and because they can&#x27;&#x27;t hear EVP that means no one else an
&gt; either.  Yeah, real scientific!
&gt;
&gt;  Gonna have to remember Google-googel- google!!
