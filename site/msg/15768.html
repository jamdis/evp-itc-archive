Assumptions and expectations!? I hear a lot of both of these concepts in yo=
ur words and when mentioning your research. Cognitive functioning or proces=
sing sensory information in order to come to a conclusion or judgement is h=
ow we function in this world. In order for your mind to understand this phy=
sical world you live in it automatically makes certain assumptions about se=
nsory information it takes in. Your eyes expect to see objects oriented cor=
rectly, with the correct color, lighting, reflectivity and shading, and you=
 expect there size and shape to be within scale compared to other objects. =
My point is your senses have a range, which implies limitations. Since this=
 is correct for your senses it is also correct for your ability to understa=
nd perspectives with any wide ranging diversity. You are able to see and pr=
ocess the information of our physical world just as any other human being d=
oes. That is great for a human but why would you think for a second,
 you c=
ould understand the perspective=A0of a mind and=A0 voice that speaks throug=
h a radio from some unknown location.
=A0
The information you receive from =
the other side of your radios or even from thin air through EVP's could be =
completely correct and true no matter what the context because you don't kn=
ow what perspective it is coming from. You are making a lot of unfounded as=
sumptions about the (dare I say) beings or worlds they exist in and have a =
lot of expectations about the information you receive. You are looking for =
answers to the wrong questions! Quit assuming that these entities know you =
or the people around you. Quit assuming they are here for your entertainmen=
t as a personal fortune teller. Quit expecting them to know answers to ques=
tion they may have themselves (just because they aren't physical doesn't me=
an they know everything). Don't assume you will be speaking to a dead relat=
ive or someone you once knew. Go to a fortune teller if you want informatio=
n about the furture. If you are serious about researching these voices and =
the equipment used to record them
 then ask the right questions. 
=A0
If yo=
u have a box made by Frank then ask Frank how the different circuits work, =
what is the puropose of some of the options, why is the RVG better or worse=
 than a circuit without it? You have a unique situation here where the inve=
ntor of an important piece of equipment is willing to share the most minute=
 details of how it works without a price tag attached. Some of the other bo=
x variations are sold by one person but created by someone else and usually=
 based on some loose design similar to Frank's. The other equipment made by=
 Bill Chapp and others will probably stay a mystery because they are sold f=
or profit. Most people who use the different "hacks" know how to make them =
but don't know much about electronic theory or the behavior of radio waves =
to understand how they work.
=A0
Point is you have plenty of questions to a=
