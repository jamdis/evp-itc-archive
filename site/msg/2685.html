<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No, I wasn&#x27;t responding to that--I thought I was responding to this  
ongoing thread about someone who didn&#x27;t hear a clip that Frank sent  
them. If you read down, there were quotes like this:

&gt;
&gt;  Maybe he is James Randi?s brother?

&gt; How could anybody NOT see anything in that photo? It&#x27;s as plain as  
&gt; the&gt; nose on my face!!!

&gt; So I just sent the guy this, bet he says he can&#x27;t see a thing in  
&gt; this picture&gt; either.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This guy won&#x27;t even look at, or see any evidence,

&gt;
&gt; He&#x27;s not a debunker. A real debunker would actually look at the  
&gt; evidence
&gt; and try to find natural explanations within his frame of knowledge.
&gt;
&gt; This guy is an idiot.
&gt;

And the invective was stronger in other parts of this thread. I just  
don&#x27;t like it when people get all mean, Bruce. Makes me sad.

&gt;
&gt; Hey guys, not to interrupt the outragefest here, but there are  
&gt; times when what you&#x27;re seeing and hearing just doesn&#x27;t agree with  
&gt; what someone else does. There where times when, for example, when a  
&gt; late member of another group showed me pictures where he was  
&gt; absolutely sure they showed something paranormal and all I saw was  
&gt; zip--sometimes not even enough to blame it on pattern recognition.  
&gt; We&#x27;d argue until the old saw was trotted out, &quot;You skeptics don&#x27;t  
&gt; believe anything.&quot; I&#x27;d always assure him that I did, in fact,  
&gt; accept the reality of EVP, life after death, UFOs, time travel, and  
&gt; any number of other paranormal issues, and just because I did not  
&gt; perceive one piece of potential evidence was actually evidence, it  
&gt; was very unfair to tar and feather me.
&gt;
&gt; There have been times when I heard a clear EVP and no one else did  
&gt; and times that others insisted they clearly heard one and I did  
&gt; not. (And I have to add that sometimes listening for EVPs amidst a  
&gt; long stream of bandwidth tuning diminishes them for me--it makes  
&gt; them sound much more likely to be broadcast fragments. Unless you  
&gt; have good headphones and are listening very carefully to each  
&gt; syllable, it sounds like junk.)
&gt;
&gt; Also, please keep in mind that when you solicit a stranger&#x27;s  
&gt; opinion, you need to accept the fact that you may not get the  
&gt; validation you are looking for. I get hundreds of supposed  
&gt; paranormal pics sent to me each year. 99.9 are camera artifacts. I  
&gt; only write back to the ones I think may be possibly paranormal  
&gt; because if I write back and say it is a camera artifact, then I end  
&gt; up in a slanging match with the person who sent it and I assure you  
&gt; that every conversation includes the sentence &quot;Well, you skeptics  
&gt; don&#x27;t believe anything!&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t know this person that all the slanging is going on about  
&gt; here, but I do know that he, like me, simply may not hear it, may  
&gt; not want to be involved for whatever reason, or may just be in a  
&gt; bad mood that someone is demanding he agree with them when he  
&gt; honestly doesn&#x27;t. There is nothing wrong with that. It doesn&#x27;t make  
&gt; him the twin brother of James Randi or even a simple skeptic.
&gt;
&gt; Have some mercy on people who don&#x27;t see with you eye to eye. Agree  
&gt; to disagree. Be good to each other, for chrissakes. This is not an  
&gt; all-or-nothing issue. And I think that once you come to the  
&gt; conclusion that you have experienced enough high strangeness to  
&gt; know, without a doubt, that the basic fact that the Other Side and  
&gt; far more exists, then the need for every possible piece of evidence  
&gt; to be real fades away. We&#x27;re not looking for evidence. We have it  
&gt; already. We&#x27;re looking for the best evidence possible.

&gt; &gt; Good question ... just take the photo, show it to someone without  
&gt; telling them ANYTHING about it and ask them what they see.I did  
&gt; that with someone at work and he said he saw the tops of two heads
