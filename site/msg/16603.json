Myself and Mike Colletta have spent countless hours trying to modify this radio with no success.  However, if you can locate the VT pin you can probably add an external sweep with no problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Barbara&quot; &lt;iamkarnesb@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; $10!  Wow.  That&#39;s great.  I can&#39;t find that model anywhere.  I&#39;d buy em all up, tweek &#39;em, and resell &#39;em on Ebay for a fair profit!  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway to answer your Q, YES, you can hack that model, just not the black ones.  Check out  Steve Hultay&#39;s site here for details on this and many other models you can use.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://linkvalidator.net/warn.php?p=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZXlwb3J0cGFyYW5vcm1hbC5jb20=\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best of luck\n&gt; &gt; Barbara\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tim&quot; &lt;sir_tim1@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hey veryone i was at the fort worth radio shack outlet sat. and they have a very big inventory of the rs 12-470 on clearance for $10. each.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  can it be hacked ? and does it click loud like the all white 469 ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
