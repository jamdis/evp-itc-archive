<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>What you don&#x27;t seem to get is that there is more to the individual than the physical body. 

 Apparently reading what one wants to hear is also problem, and seems to ge huge problme with he these skeptics. This one convinced I&#x27;m out to form a group of groupies, and she ignores all else.

 Guess we are not allowed to question out loud, or throw thoughts and theories out there for the consideration and comment of others.  Sorry, not being from &quot;here&quot; I didn&#x27;t learn all the social taboos of this primitive culture. I tried goose stepping once, it made my ankles hurt.


 I took the skeptics off moderation in a mistaken effort to be fair, but all this does is disrupt the conversation about what these voices are, and how to hear it and interpret it better. This group is not about how to explain all the inconvenient truths away.
