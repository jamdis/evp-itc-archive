strange wonder why it said little parump by the baby photo. I did listen to some of the new hosts, they all have thier own style. Few have that "up all night" voice but the show must go on. 
   
  Theres a few other talkshows out there that I find interesting even if I dont always agree with thier views it cool to keep up to date with whats being discussed.

          Art and his new wife are living in Pahrump, Nevada, again. Pahrump is right on the California state line at the Death Valley Junction area of Death Valley, one of my favorite places in the world. I was there in late September, myself. The Bells baby, Asia, was born in May, I think. He is broadcastin on C2C only rarely right now because he wants to spend his time with the baby and his wife. He does fill in for George and does specials.

  OHHHHHHH LOL, thanks for clearing something up in my head. I'll try and vice versa that with this reply.
   
  I was listening to C2C not long ago and they were saying something about Art's new baby's picture being up on the webcam so I went there and saw little "Parump" and I am sitting there wondering hmmm wonder if thats phillipines name or is its from little drummer boy (parump a pum pum)
   
  Now I know where it came from, and you know what Art is up to. Still trying to part time it from overseas at his new home with his new wife and son, and said he was retiring but I dont think people will allow him to do that. So for now I think he is mostly doing occasional special interest shows, someone correct me if I am wrong I dont get a chance to tune in every show LOL
