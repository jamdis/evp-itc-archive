My suggestion is when you get home from your time away, do a session, if possible, and see what our spirit friends tell you.  Do you happen to remember any of the details of the light.  Any such textures that stand out?

Hi All,
 
I am Andrea Carr who is a 41 year old wife and mom 
of 1 daughter. I am sorry I have not written before but I have a terrible year 
and haven't had the time to concentrate on EVP like I had prior. I won't get 
into the details but it has left me in the midst of OK just trying to pull 
through all of this BS & I will get back to it when I can.
 
Unfortunatley I am leaving for the weekend tomorrow 
morning and won't see my e-mails until Monday morning. 
 
I have a question for any one here. I believe in 
aliens, spirit and ghost communications via evp but tonight I had an experience 
I never had before.
 
I woke up at exactly 2:22 by my stove's clock and 
went and cleaned my sink of dishes while I heated up some cream chipped beef 
(albiet not too exciting) but while I sat there after in the dark with my family 
sleeping my hallway ilummating a light clored blue several times. Anyone else 
ever seen this?
 
I look forward to any responses.
 
Thanks!
Andrea
