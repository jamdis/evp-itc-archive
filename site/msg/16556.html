Deb, since people were saying that no two users would hear the same thing, =
that seemed to suggest that two users using the box at the same time would =
not work well.=C2=A0 I don't think they were saying two voices couldnt be h=

The fact that the operator CAN and DOES make recordings a=
nd files of
understandable words and phrases shows that we are dealing with=
 an
OBJECTIVE rather than a subjective phenomenon here. Two things appear
t=
o be going on though. 

First there is an actual voice modulated signal. Di=
fferent people who
listen to it often hear the same thing. The sound is not=
 perfect and is
very noisy, so that would explain others who cannot hear th=
e message.

The second thing is that some people can listen to the noise as=
 a
"random field", and with a slightly altered state of mind, this field
wi=
ll induce latent "mediumship" ability in the operator and he or she
will ge=
t a lot more information and voice material than another
listener.

       =
               

Note that the content random fields have little or nothing=
 in common
with whatever imagery or sounds may be percieved from them. They=
 simply
enhance the user to access psychic information that, while even not=

being a "psychic" allows him to get info normally innaccessable to
him/her=
.

If there is any objective percieved sound similar to what is heard by
ot=
hers impressed upon the background noise, it might be due to the
spirit who=
 is speaking being PRESENT. That entity would then be able to
get the messa=
ge through to the operator Psychicly on another level.
that the words are a=
lso in the noise would be a co-incidence.

                      

I work w=
ith VISUAL random fields---The imagery, while clear, is formed
in my mind/e=
ye system , so I cannot photograph it. Some of this EVP
background noise ma=
y be working the same way too---formed in the
Mind/EAR system. This is only=
 heard by the primary operator and likely
cannot be recorded to a file. 

B=
ut some random field stuff IS objective--for example, using a random
backdr=
op for ghost photos makes the ghosts easier to, and more often
appear in a =
photo. This is equavalent to the EVP that people can hear
on the recorded f=
ile.

                      

I will discuss and explain random field theor=
y itself, later, in its
own posting.

background noise may be working the same way too---formed in=
 the
Mind/EAR system. This is only heard by the primary operator and likely=

cannot be recorded to a file. <br>
But some random field stuff IS objectiv=
e--for example, using a random
backdrop for ghost photos makes the ghosts e=
asier to, and more often
appear in a photo. This is equavalent to the EVP t=
hat people can hear
on the recorded file.<br>
                      <br>
I =
will discuss and explain random field theory itself, later, in its
