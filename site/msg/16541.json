The\nmessages&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; received are for the user, and rarely does anyone hear the\nsame thing as the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; original listener.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does that mean two people can&#39;t use it together? How would\nthey know which&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the message was for if they do? Or is it best to only use it\nalone?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On *Thu, 1/7/10, Zack Widup &lt;a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-rfc2396E&quot; href=&quot;mailto:w9sz.zack@...&quot;&gt;&lt;w9sz.zack@. ..&gt;&lt;/a&gt;* wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Zack Widup &lt;a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-rfc2396E&quot; href=&quot;mailto:w9sz.zack@...&quot;&gt;&lt;w9sz.zack@. ..&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] What does it do?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n href=&quot;http://mc/compose?to=EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;\n target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, January 7, 2010, 10:40 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think any of us know really who or what the\n&quot;entities&quot; are.

I am not asking how it\nworks. I am&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; asking what you claim it does.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; For example, from your statements below, I get:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;The Frank&#39;s box allows entities to use FM and AM radio\nbroadcast as raw&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; material, which these enties select and shape to\ncommunicate with the user.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The messages received are for the user, and rarely does\nanyone hear the same&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thing as the original listener.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Can you be any more specific as to what you mean by\n&#39;entities&#39;?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, can the user be defined as the person asking the\nbox questions?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] What does it do?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;&lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n href=&quot;http://mc/compose?to=EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;\n target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://mc/compose? to=EVP-ITC@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Date: Thursday, January 7, 2010, 9:35 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It&#39;s a freaking radio! The tuning is swept across the\nentire band, AM or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; FM, the resulting bits of speech, music, and noise are\nused by the enitites&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as a raw material to build their voices from. The sweep\ncan be linear,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; random, or manual, and it does not have to cover the\nentire broadcast band.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This is one method and device for providing the raw\naudio, and if you&#39;re&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tesitng to see if it&#39;s just broadcast fragments, consider\nthis-the concept&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is the same as EVPmaker, EVPmaker runs on a computer, the\nentities&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; manipulate that raw audio *inside* the conmputer, and if\nyou think stray&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; RF is going to get *inside* the hard drive and mix with\nthe audio file&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you have no clue how any technology works.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Testing is irrelavent! It&#39;s not the device, it&#39;s the\nuser. The messages&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; received are for the user, and rarely does anyone hear\nthe same thing as the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; original listener.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; You test it by use, you judge it by what comes through\nand what it means&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to you, you can&#39;t play the sound snipets to a panel of\nnumbnuts(objective&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; listeners)) and expect to get an unbiased/honest test. No\ntwo people hear&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the same, so an &quot;objective listener&quot; is an insult to most\npeople doing this&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; work.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I know, I&#39;m being harsh.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Frank-S&lt;br&gt;\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n          &lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n      &lt;/tbody&gt;\n    &lt;/table&gt;\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--------------080104010404030803020605--"}
