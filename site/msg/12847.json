Ive found reference to an \nFFC listing of some stations in the USA for 1480 and 1490 (there are \nprobably more, and/or this list may be out of date or incorrect):\n1480 WZRC  NEW YORK        NY\n1480 WDAS  PHILADELPHIA    PA   \n1480 WEEO  SHIPPENSBURG    PA   \n1490 WAZL  HAZLETON        PA   \n1490 WBCB  LEVITTOWN       PA   \n1490 WUSS  PLEASANTVILLE   NJ   \n1490 WLPA  LANCASTER       PA   \n1490 WARK  HAGERSTOWN      MD   \n1490 WNTJ  JOHNSTOWN       PA   \n\nIt is important to realise that stations on 1480 or 1490 can possibly \ninterfere with any intended reception on the unused frequency of 1485 \nbeing only half a channel away.\n\nIn Europe and here in NZ, the channel spacing is 9kHz, so there are \nstations using the Jurgenson frequency of 1485kHz\nIn a quick Google search, I see there are Polish, German and Latvian \nstations listed for this frequency. \nJEFF\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;threadsintyme@...&quot; \n&lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff,\n&gt; I wonder what is on that frequency in the US?\n&gt; Al\n&gt;"}
