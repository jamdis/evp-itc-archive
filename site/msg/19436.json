There are several models available:\nsome have built in IR lights, some have IR / UV lights, some are set-up for\nsky watching, and others are just plain ol&#39; full spectrum.\n\nWith this camera (depending on the model, a regular one with the different\noptions run around $120-150), you will also need the power supply ($12-$20),\na tripod, and a portable recorder.  My group uses 2 of them and each one is\nattached to a portable DVD recorder that has a small LCD screen, you can\nfind these refurbished for under $100.\n\nTim\n\nOn Sun, Dec 12, 2010 at 3:51 PM, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; oh one more thing just because something say full spectrem does not mean it\n&gt; actually full spectrum the camera i have is the one that ghost\n&gt; adventures,ghost hunter,Bill murpghy etc have...this is the one to get!\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Sun, 12/12/10, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Full Spectrum Cameras\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, December 12, 2010, 2:31 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   lol my husband surprised me with one to :)\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Sun, 12/12/10, draiga1 &lt;mail@mysticcauldron.com&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: draiga1 &lt;mail@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Full Spectrum Cameras\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, December 12, 2010, 12:11 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to get a full spectrum camera.
