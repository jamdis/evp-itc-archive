All you need to do is go to your \n&gt; local Radio Shack and pick up the 12-469 Digital AM/FM Pocket Radio \n&gt; for ONLY $24.99 plus tax and with a simple modification. You will \n&gt; have your very own cheap alternative to a &quot;GHOST BOX&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; (I will insert a picture of the RS 12-469 here)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This simple modification lets the radio sweep both the AM and FM \n&gt; band. Instead of it scanning and stopping on a station, doing the \n&gt; modification (clipping the &quot;Mute&quot; pin) lets it just sweep the entire \n&gt; band, without stopping on any station. Just hook your Radio up to \n&gt; some speakers or headphones and while the radio is sweeping the \n&gt; bands start asking questions and get answers in real time. You can \n&gt; also record it and review it later for answers you may have missed.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are several sites for the FREE instructions on how to modify \n&gt; your Radio Shack 12-469.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://ufogeek.com/?p=81\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozhaY1fW3s4 part 1\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2ZLABu0rK0 part 2\n&gt; \n&gt; For more information from the &quot;Experts&quot; on Ghost Boxes and EVPS you \n&gt; can also go to:\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck and happy ghost hunting!!!!!!!!!!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
