&gt; No charge at all unless you own land or rent. You can
&gt; purchase  
&gt; different avatars, clothing, accessories, etc...
&gt; for your avatar. Second Life currency is called
&gt; &quot;Lindens&quot;. You can by  
&gt; quite a lot of lindens for a couple of bucks via Paypal.
&gt; You can also get many avatars and clothes, costumes, you
&gt; name it, for  
&gt; free. There are a lot of &quot;freebie&quot; type places on
&gt; SL.
&gt; 
&gt; For a long time, I got everything free and had a lot of fun
&gt; playing  
&gt; with my avatar. You can get pretty creative. I once saw
&gt; Jesus float by  
&gt; and angels were singing around him - it was a riot - and
&gt; later saw a  
&gt; very strange looking Elvis. You can be anything in SL.
&gt; 
&gt; Many different spiritual &amp; metaphysical groups meet in
&gt; SL. They have  
&gt; places to meditate, talk, you name it. It&#x27;s a lot of
&gt; fun to explore.
&gt; 
&gt; For a recording group, I was envisioning meeting once or
&gt; twice a month  
&gt; (or more) to discuss our research and perhaps even try to
&gt; record as a  
&gt; group... combine energies. Might be fun &amp; interesting!

&gt; &gt; w.  I checked out the site quickly.  Looks like a
&gt; monthly charge is  
&gt; &gt; involved or no?  I will get back to it again when I
&gt; have more time.   
&gt; &gt; What do you envision with a recording group...I might
&gt; be  
&gt; &gt; interested?  ron l
