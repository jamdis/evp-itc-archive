There was no white noise being played at the same time nor \non review.\n\nWhat surprised me was the clarity of the answers to direct questions \nwhich could then be checked on a reviewing the tape. But also that on \none ocassion the replies weren&#39;t audible until the replay of the taped \nsession was heard.\n\nIs this typical?\n\nI can upload the sessions which are quite interesting due to the \nsubject being discussed."}
