<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hmmm I think perhaps if you type those keywords into 
google &quot;electronics&quot; &quot;tutorials&quot; you may find some of what you seek. 
There are a few places online that have tutorials posted and also on 
youtube they have step by step tutorials with video showing how they 
are doing it. 

http://www.electronics-tutorials.com/ seems to offer a few insights as 
well as diagrams etcetera into the basics of building some peices of 
equipment. There are also alot of BIY projects (build it yourself).

&gt; I was wondering if anyone knew of any good online electronics 
tutorials 
&gt; (schematics, building, etc...). Once upon a time I used to know how 
to 
&gt; read circuit schematics being a ham radio operator, but that was a 
very 
&gt; long time ago. I would certainly like to refresh my knowledge and 
&gt; attempt completion of my own projects based on some of the schematics 
&gt; here. Modifying existing devices comes easy for me, but starting from 
&gt; scratch leaves me scratching my head...
&gt; 
&gt; thanks in advance
