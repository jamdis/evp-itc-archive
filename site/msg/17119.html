<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That turned out to be nothing as well. I often get voices through the box
that are just something I will see or hear in the future. I&#x27;ve been rading
the original Bible code, and came across the date &quot;May 7th&quot; in a paragraph.
It was just something I would see, and seems to have no other meaning.

 BTW, reading the Bible Code the other night, and seeing how the inventor
and researchers are extremely religious, and all their findings seem to me
to match their expectations, sooo- thinking it&#x27;s all BS and suddenly it was
like something hit the breaker panel and BAM! the lights goes out or about a
quarter second!  Yikes!  If I didn&#x27;t think all churches were totaly corrupt
I&#x27;m be on my knees in a pew somewhere.

 Also, what I did not know was that there was a comet prediction in the
bible code for 2006, and I did have voices predicting &quot;it hits the earth&quot; on
June 15th--2006. There is more at work on this planet than man, but I&#x27;m not
prepared to buy all the religious junk.

&gt;  I didn&#x27;t see if this was mentioned before you&#x27;re initial post about the
&gt; 7th Frank. I heard there was another bomb threat in NY Times square today.
&gt; Did you mention it and I just missed that? If so, sorry. If not, things just
&gt; got more interesting. You sure do get some amazing messages.

&gt;  Not that I could hear, but I thought there was something about a boom. .
&gt; I&#x27;ve gotten date before that meant nothing, so not holding my breath.

&gt;&gt;  Well, interesting that both NY incidents were this week, and I had voices
&gt;&gt; saying soemthing aobut May 7th. For me, if I hear something in the voices
&gt;&gt; and try to get clarification, it goes all to hell, that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t ask
&gt;&gt; questions.
