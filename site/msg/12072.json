Here&#39;s all the new video links all in one shot:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1.

Speakjet Box #4\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATT047qD6sM\n&gt; \n&gt; I still have a couple more to get to eventually, but not today.\n&gt; Maybe one day we will have clear back and forth full communication,\n&gt; but it&#39;s not possible at this point. Although it is getting better\n&gt; all the time. Full conversations in detail unfortunately is not\n&gt; possible, no matter what anybody claims. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanx for watching,\n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
