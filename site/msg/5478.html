<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I like what everyone is saying regarding this subject, because people 
are at different places with respect to one&#x27;s own spirituality. I 
agree with Frank, because mankind has a tendency to create, or 
rather &quot;mis-create&quot; through fear.  Yet, I also believe some people 
need to believe in protection from spirits of the light, so fear does 
not take hold.  I look at it like this: All of us believe we are 
protected who are running these experiments; either by our own power 
and ability, or by some other unseen entity...or both. If we give 
anything power, we become its slave.  

I truly have no problem with either idea, as it just could be that 
those from the light assist, protect and guide us, because many of us 
on earth do not know just how much power we really have. Fear 
typically causes us to surrender our power over and &quot;mis-think.&quot;  

Thus, I say:  Whatever works to keep a person free of fear is good 
with me.

EVP work since the early 90&#x27;s and have never gotten a 
&gt; dark cursing EVP. The only thing I have gotten is a cursed word 
used 
&gt; describing someone and it just so happened that one night we were 
&gt; doing a white noise vs pink noise experiment and running late so we 
&gt; didn&#x27;t pray. So personally I believe it makes a difference, but 
it&#x27;s 
&gt; really up to the individual. Personally, I feel alike attracts 
alike. 
&gt; So staying positive and upbeat before hand and during probably 
really 
&gt; makes a difference no matter what.
&gt; 
&gt; We have also captured a good many apparition over the years via 
&gt; camera, and again prayer is done whenever we are going out on an 
&gt; investigation or paranormal shooting. The ones we have captured 
they 
&gt; always seem to be running or going a different direction than us, 
so 
&gt; again I feel it makes a difference. We have two Pagans on our team. 
&gt; One prays, and one doesn&#x27;t. The one that does is just starting out 
&gt; and has been getting some great shots and a few EVP&#x27;s. The one that 
&gt; doesn&#x27;t in 2 years has only gotten a few shots and no 
EVP&#x27;s......but 
&gt; I leave the choice up to each team member.
&gt; 
&gt; That&#x27;s my thoughts on it, it really boils down to personal 
&gt; preferences.

&gt; OK if I post the link here? If not that&#x27;s OK too :)
