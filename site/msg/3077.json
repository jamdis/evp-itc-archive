Heres the link for those who are curious. You \nguys should use the subfolders so all your files are in one folder \nand easier to locate.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Misty%20Dawns/\n&gt;    \n&gt;   or you can click on files if you are on the group site. Theres \nquite a few different things I have tried but I may post those to my \nesnips eventually for you all.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Be a better pen pal.
