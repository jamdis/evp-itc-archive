The detector\n&gt; runs on a single\n&gt; lithium-ion battery and captures the &quot;specific rhythm\n&gt; of ultrawaves in\n&gt; an area&quot; that are supernaturally aligned, according to\n&gt; Solid Alliance\n&gt; spokesman Shuichiro Saito.The detector also translates what\n&gt; the maker\n&gt; calls &quot;spatial algorithms&quot;into electronic sounds,\n&gt; warning the user if\n&gt; a supernatural being isapproaching. Solid Alliance claims\n&gt; on its Web\n&gt; site that Baketan 2 reacted strongly when tested at sites\n&gt; that are\n&gt; deemed haunted. The gadget maker has sold more than 50,000\n&gt; sets in\n&gt; less than three years.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Got Game?
