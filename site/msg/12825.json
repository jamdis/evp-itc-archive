You might want to share the audio track from your \nexperiment with the group. I recordedand listened to it at about \n60%. Sure sounds like there could be a few words in there...others \nin the group with more editing experience might help you pick \nsomething out. ron\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 11/15/08, M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Diode EVP Capture Device I built\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, November 15, 2008, 8:28 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I did some testing of the device this evening... and wow! It \n&gt; worked better than I thought it would.\n&gt; It&#39;s not a microphone but it picks up energy in the area and \nproduces \n&gt; waveforms.\n&gt; I&#39;ve produced a short video showing a demonstration of what it \n&gt; captured in two modes. You can see that video, here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube. com/watch? v=GqRI0F59uDk\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; - Mike (UFO Geek)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My prototype design of an EVP capture device using diodes, coils,\n&gt; &gt; resistors.
