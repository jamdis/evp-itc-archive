I currently own a Frank&#39;s Box, #12, which was actually willed to me via Bruce.  I had no problem with communication from the get go, and actually have been present many times before and worked with audio clips for several years prior to receiving a Frank&#39;s Box.  There are many differences with the make up of each and every box, with the exceptions of the RS.  At no time have I ever had problems getting good communication given I had good reception.  We all struggle at times having good or bad sessions, but that is the nature of the beast.  \n   \n             The other women to own a Frank&#39;s Box is Rosemary Ellen Guiley.  She has 2 Frank&#39;s Boxes. Ursula Bielski also owns a Joe&#39;s Box.   I don&#39;t believe this was intentional on Frank&#39;s part, it just happened this way.  After Chris Moon obtainning the boxes and the falling out between Frank and Chris, he has just decided that it is better at this time not to give anyone any.  The Mini Box as well as the RS serve the same purpose and you can get just as good of communication from them.\n   \n                It is my theory that the color purple as to do with the energy level, Tesla also believed this.  This is only my theory and doubt we will ever be able to pin point the reference in my life time.  I have a theory as well about vibrations and I can clue you in later on that in obtaining EVP.\n   \n                 As far as building a box, there is a great book out there called Electronic Pojects from the Next Dimension by Newton C. Braga.  There are schmatics in there for different projects, as well as box schmatics on all of the boards.  It&#39;s just like anything else at the idea that you will have to make changes as you go along to see what works for you.\n   \n                  The audio software is the same, which ever you think works for you.  There are so many out there.  I use Adobe Audition, Bruce and Steve use Cool Edit, Ann uses something for her Mac. (ect.).  There are free downloads on most of our sites www.ispiinvestigations.com.  Try them out, and see which one you like the best.  There are so many of us at this point that at least one of us are bound to have the experience in using it, LOL.\n   \n                     I hope this helps, looking forward to hearing your clips!\n   \n  Juli\n\nHolly &lt;holly2422@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hello all !!\nI have been lurking on the board for awhile, feeling not much to \ncontribute.\nI am interested in this connection and communication (Thanks to \nDebbie !!)\nI&#39;ve observed a few things on the board. Somehow this word &quot;purple&quot; \nkeeps popping up and I can&#39;t help but to think of the color purple in \nthe spectrum. Does the color relate to some sort of sound wave \nalso ? or correlates to something in the electronic field that your \nhelpers from the other side are trying to propose ?\n\nAlso, I have noticed that the Frank boxes do not seem to be \ndistributed to many women (is this because women do not have good \nresults with the other side ?)\nI know Debbie has done a lot of successful work, but, does this mean \nthat women have a more difficult time with communication ?\n\nI don&#39;t have a box and I don&#39;t know how to build one !! I went to \nradio shack and whatever was recommended is replaced with the new 470.\n\nI don&#39;t know where to begin except that Frank recommended starting \nwith EVPMAKER. I&#39;d like to build something of my own and don&#39;t know \nwhere to start with a receiver/scanner of my own.\nI&#39;d be so happy if someone could share some technology with me !!!??\nthanks, Holly\n\n\n\n                         \n\n\n  The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private & confidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is addressed to.  \n   \n  No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or forwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.\n\n\r\n--0-1952021247-1204304104=:89581\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Holly:&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WOW...so many questions, lol!&nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me address the communication with the women and the Boxes!&nbsp; I currently own a Frank&#39;s Box, #12, which was actually willed to me via Bruce.&nbsp; I had no problem with communication from the get go, and actually have been present many times before and worked with audio clips for several years prior to receiving a Frank&#39;s Box.&nbsp; There are many differences with the make up of each and every box, with the exceptions of the RS.&nbsp; At no time have I ever had problems getting good communication given I had good reception.&nbsp; We all struggle at times having good or bad sessions, but that is the nature of the beast.&nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other women to own a Frank&#39;s Box is Rosemary\n Ellen Guiley.&nbsp; She has 2 Frank&#39;s Boxes.&nbsp;Ursula Bielski also owns a Joe&#39;s Box.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#39;t believe this was intentional on Frank&#39;s part, it just happened this way.&nbsp; After Chris Moon obtainning the boxes and the falling out between Frank and Chris, he has just decided that it is better at this time not to give anyone any.&nbsp; The Mini Box as well as the RS serve the same purpose and you can get just as good of communication from them.&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my theory that the color purple as to do with the energy level, Tesla also believed this.&nbsp; This is only my theory and doubt we will ever be able to pin point the reference in my life time.&nbsp; I have a theory as well about vibrations and I can clue you in later on that in obtaining EVP.&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; \n &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as building a box, there is a great book out there called Electronic Pojects from the Next Dimension by Newton C.
