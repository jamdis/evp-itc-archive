The creature is often described as a flying biped with =\r\nhooves, but there are many variations. The Jersey Devil has worked its way =\r\ninto the pop culture of the area, even lending its name to New Jersey&#39;s tea=\r\nm in the National Hockey League.\n\n\nLegends and reported encounters:\n\n\nMost =\r\naccounts of the Jersey Devil legend attribute the creature to a &quot;Mother Lee=\r\nds&quot;, a supposed whore although the tale has many variations. According to o=\r\nne version, she invoked the devil by saying &quot;let it be the devil&quot; while giv=\r\ning birth to her 13th child, and when the baby was born, it either immediat=\r\nely or soon afterward transformed into a devil like creature and flew off i=\r\nnto the surrounding pines. The child was born with horns, a tail, wings, an=\r\nd a horse-like head. The creature revisited Mrs. Leeds every day. She stood=\r\n at her door and told it to leave. After awhile, the creature got the hint =\r\nand never returned. \nAccording to legend, while visiting the Hanover Mill W=\r\norks to inspect his cannonballs being forged, Commodore Stephen Decatur sig=\r\nhted a flying creature flapping its wings and fired a cannonball directly u=\r\npon it to no effect. Joseph Bonaparte, eldest brother of Emperor Napoleon, =\r\nis also said to have witnessed the Jersey Devil while hunting on his Borden=\r\ntown, New Jersey estate around 1820. Throughout the 19th century, the Jerse=\r\ny Devil was blamed for livestock killings, strange tracks, and reported sou=\r\nnds. In the early 20th century, a number of people in New Jersey and neighb=\r\noring states claimed to witness the Jersey Devil or see its tracks. Claims =\r\nof a corpse matching the Jersey Devil&#39;s description arose in 1957. In 1960,=\r\n the merchants around Camden offered a $10,000 reward for the capture of th=\r\ne Jersey Devil, even offering to build a private zoo to house the creature =\r\nif captured.\nThere are many other versions of the legend. The legends say i=\r\nt was the 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, or 13th child, It was born normal or deform=\r\ned, and the mother confined it to the cellar or the attic. Although there a=\r\nre many discrepancies in all of these stories, there are 3 pieces of eviden=\r\nce that tie all of the legends of the Jersey Devil&#39;s origin together. From =\r\nthe pre 1909 era, few documented records of sightings still exist. The ones=\r\n that do, confirm the existence of the devil.\n\n\nChris Chaos\nAxis Video/Pine=\r\n Barren Films\nPO BOX 551\nGloucester, NJ 08030\n\n\r\n----------MB_8CE0FFC8517BCF2_32A8_2A7E_webmail-d141.sysops.aol.com\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;\r\n\r\n&lt;font color=3D&#39;black&#39; size=3D&#39;2&#39; face=3D&#39;arial&#39;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;cl=\r\near:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 10p=\r\nx; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right:=\r\n 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; border-top-style: none; border-=\r\nright-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; bord=\r\ner-width: initial; border-color: initial; background-color: transparent; fo=\r\nnt-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; &quot;&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;=\r\nApple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=\r\n=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DbT-UUvU6a8U&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D=\r\nbT-UUvU6a8U&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-=\r\nstyle-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: arial; &quot;&gt;http://www.indiegogo.com/The-Sea=\r\nrch-For-the-Jersey-Devil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;Ari=\r\nal, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-spa=\r\nn&quot; face=3D&quot;arial&quot;&gt;Axis Video and Pine Barren Films have joined forces in cr=\r\neating a documentary film &quot;THE SEARCH FOR THE NEW JERSEY DEVIL&quot;.
