CB brings up a great point in that each user has their own input and indivi=
dual "key" regarding how well a certain device is going to work for them. I=
 think the same holds true for the impetus, energy and intelligence behind =
the=A0GB=A0phenomenon...certainly "they" have just as much to do with it as=
 "we" do...(perhaps even more so!). 
=A0
I feel it's at least a=A03 PART dy=
namic and one which exists between the device itself, the operator and thos=
e on the other side. 
=A0
I'm in agreement that what works best for one mig=
ht be horrible=A0for another (& vice versa)=A0and this is something we coul=
d all do well to keep in mind - perhaps especially myself as I've been quit=

th them is the furthest thing from the "holy work" or final word on the sub=
ject. Like everyone else here=A0I experiment, conduct my sessions, record m=
y work and file my research in effort to find what works best FOR ME and ga=
rners the=A0greatest results. 
=A0
Part of what makes this field, our indiv=
