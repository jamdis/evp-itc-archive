<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just did my first session with an older 12-469, the gray and white
one.  I had to go to Radio Shack for a couple cables and saw it
hanging next to the new 12-469&#x27;s and grabbed it.  Brought it home and
was up and running in five minutes.  Next session will be with the 20-125.

Had to stop my review of the audio because I had to share this.  I
will post anything else I find.  

The audio is straight from a mixer to the computer and recorded in
Audacity.  I&#x27;ve done no editing to the file except cut out this
snippet. Let me know what you think.
