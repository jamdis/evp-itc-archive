<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>During the day, there is a layer of the ionosphere, called the D layer, 
which is present due to direct exposure of the ionosphere by the sun.  It 
absorbs medium-frequency radio signals (the AM band) and you can&#x27;t hear 
stations much farther away than a couple hundred miles, as a rule. 
At night the D layer breaks down and AM-band radio signals can reflect off 
the higher F layer of the ionosphere, so you can hear stations hundreds 
and thousands of miles away in that band. The AM broadcast band becomes 
filled with stations.

There are many small low-power AM stations on frequencies that have become 
referred to as &quot;graveyard frequencies&quot; because there are hundreds of them 
across the USA, spaced far enough apart that they don&#x27;t interfere with 
each other in the day.  At night, many of them decrease their power or 
just go off the air. That way, they minimize interference with each other. 
Listen on 1340 at night some time!

Local station WILL-AM here on 580 shares a frequency with a station in, I 
think, Kansas.  They have a two-tower antenna array.  During the day they 
transmit using only one tower with a pretty much omnidirectiional signal. 
At night the two towers are energized in such a way as to produce a null 
in their pattern in the direction of Kansas, so they don&#x27;t interfere with 
the other station. When you see AM radio stations using multiple towers, 
it&#x27;s usually so they can do beam-forming at night to avoid interference 
with others.  When I was studying antenna engineering in college, we were 
given a homework assignment to figure out what the dual towers of WILL-AM 
did.  :-)

A few stations across the country on &quot;clear channels&quot; (there is only one 
licensed station on that frequency) would increase their power to extend 
their range even further at night.  WLS radio in Chicago (890), WLW in 
Cincinnati (700) and WJR in Detroit (800) were examples of this. I&#x27;m not 
sure if they still do it.

Nighttime AM band propagation is subject to &quot;selective fading&quot;, where the 
signals increase and decrease in strength. Sometimes they drop out 
completely for a minute or so.

During the winter, when the nights are longer and static crashes from 
storms are fewer, with a good receiver and antenna you can hear stations 
from Europe at night on the AM band.  I was able to hear a BBC broadcast a 
couple weks ago.

&gt; I understand that sun interference would affect the day signal and a big factor is radio stations in the u.s. can boost their signal strength in later hours.  Might be urban legend.

&gt; Quite a few researchers get better reception at night.
&gt; I believe that is due to the fact that less signal traffic
&gt; generally at night than during the day. consiquently that will
&gt; allow for the weaker signals to be picked up.

&gt;      Bruce, I will definitely ask about the name Tim and about a tech. The
&gt; &quot;very bored&quot; part, at least if I&#x27;m hearing it correctly, proceeds as
&gt; soon and the name &quot;Tim&quot; is ending and is at a lot lower decibel level.
&gt; Could be one of those things meant for me to hear, as in I was boring
&gt; them. It&#x27;s any body&#x27;s guess.
&gt;
&gt; I got better reception as I did the session at around 8:45pm.
&gt; Nighttime seems better for reception around here.
