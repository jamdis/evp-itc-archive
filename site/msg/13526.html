I personally have not used this device, but a close friend and fellow inves=
tigator just purchased one. She has used it only a few times but the result=
s were encourageing. On her first recorded session, when asking "why are yo=
u here", the reply that she recieved certainly seemed relevant. The Ovilus =
stated " fell running down stairs, broken neck". Another interesting respon=
se from the recording was in reply to the question "who are you?" The respo=
nse from the Ovilus was "ghost". However, she also=A0recieved responses tha=
t did not seem relevant to the questions she was asking at the time.=A0She =
sends me all of her recordings for review so I will keep you posted on the =
results. Personally, I can't wait to get my hands on one to try it out for =
myself.
