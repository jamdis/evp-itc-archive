Apparently there&#39;s patent \n&gt; &gt; stuff involved, but it&#39;s supposed to be coming out. \n&gt; \n&gt; Did you really mean speech-to-text, or text-to-speech?\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s a text-to-speech IC for the SpeakJet:\n&gt; http://www.speechchips.com/shop/item.aspx?itemid=4\n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan\n&gt;"}
