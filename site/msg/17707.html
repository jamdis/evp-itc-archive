Please remove me from this group. I am asking most respectfully. There is s=
o much contention, outright animosity and name calling the topic goes from =
being about the EVP's to personal attacks on such a regular basis there is =
almost no space for what this group is truly about. The negative energies a=
re too much for me. 
=C2=A0
I truly hope, Frank, you get the support you ne=
ed and deserve to further your research. I see how passionate you are about=
 this and my wish for you is one day you won't need to prove to others how =
exactly correct you are about the voices of those speaking from the other s=
ide. I know they are speaking. I have many EVP's that have been proven corr=
ect. They are clear and concise. Mine were from using a voice recorder. Fra=
nk, I believe you.
=C2=A0
I won't argue and beleaguer the point. No, it is =
not=C2=A0from a place of " oh you just can't stand up under scrutiny," it i=
s from the place of all of this sidetracking and negativity is useless. I h=
ave no need to prove myself or the recordings. The families for whom they w=
ere done proved it. Clear voices. Clear messages. 
=C2=A0
Some individuals =
feel the need to argue everything endlessly due to the need to feel superio=
r and always right. Some individuals do it due to a lack of self esteem and=
 they feel superior when putting others down, making rude challenges, pushi=
ng the envelope and manipulating a situation to appear as superior when in =
fact they are not.
=C2=A0
I need nor want none of this in my life and choos=
e to be removed.

Take every chance you get because some things only happen=
 once...
