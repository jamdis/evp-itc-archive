A=\r\nll they could do was plot the orbits of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; planets =\r\nwith unbelievable accuracy and at a time when western science still&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt;&gt; thought the Earth was the center of the universe and flat! =\r\nThese ancients&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; built structures that &quot;modern&quot; scienc=\r\ne can&#39;t even comprehend, yet &quot;modern&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; scientists act=\r\n like they know everything and all has been discovered. These&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; scientists already know everything,. so no need to check their fa=\r\ncts.
