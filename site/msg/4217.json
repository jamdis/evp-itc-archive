I know on your video \nyou mentioned both a shoebox or cigar box could be used as well.\n\nI&#39;m going to try this chamber experiment, but my question is what \nenclosure would be best so as not to inhibit the sounds, by the \nmaterial of the enclosure actually absorbing any of the sound.\n\nI&#39;m no scientist by any means, so maybe my concern is mute, but it \nwould seem to me that perhaps a glass (or lead crystal) or metal (tin \nbox) enclosure would be an interesting experiment as well.\n\nAlso, have you given any thought to a single toggle/power up switch \nthat would power all devices on at once, perhaps from outside of the \nbox, thereby eliminating the need to open and close the box with each \nsession.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nthanks!\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Rita,\n&gt; \n&gt; Welcome to the group.  Yes, Bruce is correct... my sound chamber \ndesign is an experiment to see how well that design works.  I took \nthe basic components of a typical ghost box system and placed them \ninto the plastic enclosure. But to hear what is desired does not \nalways require a chamber. The chamber is just a place where the three \nsound components can mix and be captured by the microphone.\n&gt; Just one of many different methods that can be used.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have even got good results by just using a 12-470 and a recorder \nin the open air.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did build a couple of new chamber systems and will probably build \none more for a total of 4.  And I&#39;ll probably provide some of those \nto some locals here to test. I&#39;d like to get others input on this \nexperimental design. LC is also putting one together using the 12-\n469. So we will have data from that area too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again... welcome to the group.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Rita,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; And welcome to the group I am always pleased to see new members \nand new interest in our research.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; You do not need anything extra to use the 12-469 you can use it \nwith just the ear buds that are supplied with the radio.\n&gt; &gt; If you like you can purchase an inexspensive fold up speaker from \nradio shack.

In that \nchamber, you will want probably an amplified microphone running into \nyour voice recorder, to pick up the sounds bouncing around in there. \nYou can also add some white noise into the box, but I think people \nare getting results without adding the additional noise. The chamber \nseems to really bounce the sound around and give you a good mix to \nrecord.LC--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rita&quot; &lt;nvrenuf1031@&gt; \nwrote:&gt;&gt; Hi Everyone,&gt; &gt; New to group here. We just completed the \nadvance hack on our 469 &gt; model. Are you supposed to hear the voices \nfrom the radio stations or &gt; just white noise?&gt; &gt; Also, is it best to \nhook up an external speaker, one or two, in order &gt; to record to a \ndigital recorder? What is the best way to record, using &gt; digital \nrecorder, or direct into PC using Sound recorder, and using a &gt; line \nin/line out connection?&gt; &gt; What is the recommended length of \nsessions. Should I try just a minute &gt; or two, or longer at one \nsitting?&gt; &gt; Thanks to all!&gt; Rita&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Get the power of Windows + Web with the new Windows Live.\n&gt; &gt; http://www.windowslive.com?\nocid=TXT_TAGHM_Wave2_powerofwindows_122007\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
