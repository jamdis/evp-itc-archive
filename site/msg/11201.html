<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I would suggest as much a controlled experiment as possiable. Because our recorders are so sensitive it should be in a place where only the &#x27;readers&#x27; would be heard. I would keep the &#x27;scripts&#x27; under two minutes. Try to place some distance from the readers and the microphone (at least 20 feet). A room with a slight echo should work best. Keep everyone in a &#x27;testing&#x27; frame of mind. As an example the scripts could be three different classic poems everyone would be familier with. As you know, frame of mind and intent will be very important to get any cooperation.

Good Luck,

Dave

I have not thought of this...such a simple idea! How long would the scripts have to be? One minute, two? Shorter, longer? 
This is something that we could as a group...I can see it now...sitting in the restaurant where we meet with a bunch of us reading at the same time and then recording it...and playing it all back. Brother, those Christians will really get an earful! They always sit in the same area as us and &quot;sit and stare and glare&quot; as we discuss spirits. LOL. hehehehe hehehehe

I&#x27;ll add my two cents here for what it&#x27;s worth. The term I have heard in many of my own sessions is &#x27;Heterodyne&#x27;. They somehow combine/mix multiple sounds, frequencies and or energy to produce the voices. A good test of this is to have three people reading from different scripts (for control) at the same time, ask your questions while all three are speaking and listen for a loud response in the combined voices in the playback. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodyne

Zack,
Is it possible that spirits use sound similar to our using a carrier wave on the AM radio spectrum? IE, we use turn an AM transmitter on, the transmitter automatically sends out a &quot;carrier wave.&quot; Sound is then piggy backed on the wave and sent from the transmitter (no matter what the sound is). 
I wonder if anyone has used a white noise generator in a cemetery with any results?

I have suspected that spirits use existing noises and sounds to change or 
modulate them when they produce EVP. I have one EVP that occurred right 
after someone asked &quot;Are you happy?&quot; and during the time a car passed by 
outside the building it was recorded in. When we were in the building all 
we heard was the motor sound. On the recording, the motor sound plainly 
becomes the words &quot;Course I&#x27;m haapee.&quot;

&gt; Sweep tuning can be used on AM FM shortwave etc. I have had some
&gt; success without tuning just allowing them to use the static or water
&gt; noise thats in background. Best advice one cold give is try it
&gt; yourself for a while and see what you come up with =)

&gt;&gt; Why do you need to &quot;sweep&quot; the AM spectrum?
&gt;&gt; Has anyone tried this but without sweeps on the shortwave band? Has
&gt; any research been done? Could it be that the AM band has some sort
&gt; of &quot;special properties&quot; that would allow such communication?
&gt;&gt; Why is it that the AM band has to be used with a radio station
&gt; playing? There are parts of the spectrum that is just outside of that
&gt; spectrum that might provide a better form of communication.
