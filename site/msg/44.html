this is great, i love the details! I am so new to this and really dont have a clue what i am doing. I knowhow to turn it on and record, use noise fans white etc and to clen it up if i need to. Thats about it. Where and why you started and how you did it, and how you got to where you are today is VERY helpful! Feel free to "babble" and clafify away all you want! I need the help.

  Those are actually very good questions. One thing I have learned is respect is very important when recording and communicating (of course your going to still from time to time get those not so nice entities or beings). 
  
  Now when I first began recording I didn�t even ask questions but the very first night I got a class A �I�m 12� this was in 2003 in my NH home. I had a lot of activity there good and some with bad attitudes. I had been called a bitch & told to go away. I lost a lot of my earliest EVP but now I have an external hard drive to back up all of it. One thing there is no redo when it comes to a lost EVP :(
  
  I think they can get mad at you. In 2004 I had a website called �Vortex of the Paranormal�. I had a friend who granted me permission to put up her husbands pictures on the site of him alive and his visits. Well shortly after he got mad and told her so. She felt nervous about telling me to talk it off but she was being told he would not talk to her unless this was done. I immediately respected this and removed them.
  
  I have also watched TAPS (sorry if you like them I am just trying to tell how I see this) and they seem to disrespect the spirit world & I know they get some evidence but having been in the field in either a in private home & my own included in NH I know was haunted I had very little trouble getting excellent EVP results and had also captured one ghost picture at that home or also at a private investigations whether it�s a haunted place or private residence. My husband had a knack for getting orb pictures and still does. I hardly ever get orbs but I prefer EVP.
  
  It depends if a loved one knew you recorded or was able to figure it out that makes it easier. But for example some spirits might not even know what the devices we are using are so when I record I ask that they speak into the device with the read light and I will be able to hear them ( I own mostly IC & digital recorders). I also ask questions & say thank you at the end.  Now I realize if you got a grouch one they can just be that way I often tell them I don�t accept that and that they are not welcome when I record. But see this can vary to how you feel, who are trying to communicate with. Also where and why.
  
  OK probably babbling and not making much since right now. I can explain more about why I feel this way or clarify if it helps.
  
  Andrea

          well if yall are very expiereinced in this, i just started doing evp's a few weeks ago!

    I know that these folks have been around me and some are where i live. the first time i did an evp i got nothing till the 3rd time. Then its seems that it opened a door for them, they are conversing amongst themselves saying hello to each other, that they can see, they can see the computer, one of them said he was beseiged. I didnt record again till yesterday, and i kinda wonder if they are mad? i kept getting vibes to record but have been to tired with moving. Can they get mad with you? i assume they can. When i recorded, i have been using microsoft word and typing my questions, and a little bit of talking too, if they can see the computer <so they said> why not?! I also used this thing from EVP maker that shows pictures and makes clicks and tones. The only thing they had to say was "watch" watch", wether they ment to not say anything and just watch me or ref to some of the questions i had, i dont know, cant assume anything lol. What can i do to get them to talk to me
 more? Answer questions? like no one has indentified themselves and i would really like to know who they are. I have a few people i would like to talk to that have passed over. However anyone is nice lol. I just would like to open this door MORE now, that i have closed off. I think that I opened a doorway for them but i want to interact more! People have been refering to me as a "sensitive"? I assume meaning that i am able to tell if they are here etc. Which i usually can. Is it possible that because in the past for the most part i have kept this part of me closed off, except those entities that refuse to be silenced come through, that they are skeptical of talking to me? That i cant handle it?

    

    Anyway, justthought id talk with somemore people who have "been there done that"

    I would like to have someone over who has alot of history and do an evp in my home and talk to them for me. <sigs>
