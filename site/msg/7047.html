Hopefully your sister has received the radio already. It got shipped 
priority mail. Have fun with it. I really like the way the FM scan 
rate is....

technology. Mike is sending a box already hacked so we can work with 
the box and hopefully get something recorded. Since I have little 
experience as a newbie to this, I would love to see how someone puts 
all of it together...recording, analyzing, etc.

ordering a mini-box to be sent to my folks house in Allentown, so I 
will have that to play with. Let me know. Ron Lederer
