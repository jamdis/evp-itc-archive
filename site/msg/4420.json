Batteries \ngood?  Wire from batteries crimped or cut? ;) - LC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; So dummy here couldn&#39;t even follow Mike&#39;s great video instructions \nwith the RS12-469.  After driving two hours to Merida, Mexico and \nthen back and putting down 600 pesos (about $55 dollars) it took me \nten minutes to do everything UFO Geek laid out in his video for \nhacking the radio shack box.  Cut the right pin labeled mute.  Closed \nthe box nicely.  Nothing.  Reopened the box...looked around...two \ntimes more...still nothing.   Not even a light or hum.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Until I figure the radio thing out, I am in the mean time getting \nnowhere (it seems) with the EVP Maker on my computer to generate EVP \nnoise and using my hand recorder etc.   Wish I could try the radio \nsistem...any real geeks who can give technical suggestions would be \ngreatly appreciated.  Or maybe I should just throw away my 469 and \nstart over.   Dont think RS will take it back.     geek-wanna-be, Ron \nL\n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Never miss a thing.   Make Yahoo your homepage.\n&gt;"}
