Elabeth,
 
I have A LOT OF TOYS at=
 this time.  Which I am sure a lot of other
paranormal investigators have a=
s well.  I am not selling this unit
because it does not work but because it=
 does work and I have lots of
other toys and boxes that work as well.  I al=
so have a few other boxes
that I will be selling and maybe listing on Ebay =
as well.  And I just
recently went on an investigation at Eastern State Pen=
n and I had so
much equipment there and not enough hands or body to carry i=
t, LOL.  So
I do not want to put myself in that position oagain.
