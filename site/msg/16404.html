It don't make it right Frank and you know that.=C2=A0 Ultimately it is your=
 name.=C2=A0 As I said I am very much a skeptic, but I am a nice one.=C2=A0=
 When this jackass pulls something and gets in trouble, it will come back o=
n you.=C2=A0 After all, it is a "Frank's Box"=C2=A0 

The=C2=A0fact that th=
ere are others out there ripping people off dose not change the face he is =
doing so in your name, and apparently with your approval.

I would seriousl=
y think about removing=C2=A0yourself from such things and people.

Thanks, =
don't want to be a downer LOL=C2=A0 But what I am telling you is the truth.=

=C2=A0"Nature is showing us only the tail of the lion, but I have no doubt=
 that the lion belongs to it even though, because of its large size, it can=
not totally reveal itself all at once."

"It =
is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delu=

"There is no such=
 thing as an insignificant detail. Don't just look 
for what you want to fi=
nd."
