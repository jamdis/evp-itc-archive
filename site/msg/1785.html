<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Some guys on Pulse radio mentioned my website on their show on July 
27th.  I happened to tune in on this paranormal radio just as they 
mentioned my site.  I was able to download the podcast and put it on 
my site under &quot;Radio Broadcast&quot;.  Another thing i did was create a 
folder called &quot;Box test audio&quot;, basically i uploaded 2 ten minute 
files of each of my boxes playing and than made 2 folders on my 
message board entitled box #1 and box #2.  And i want people to listen 
and write what they think they heard and at what time it was in the 
file so i can review.  I thought this would be a good way for people 
to hear a full session and come to there own conclusion and also get 
involved. If you&#x27;d like to check it out:

It&#x27;s www.keyportparanormal.com

I update frequently and have some cool stuff on there.
