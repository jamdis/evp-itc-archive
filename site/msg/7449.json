{"id": "7449", "subject": "New to the board", "author": "Holly", "timestamp": "2008-02-29T16:33:05Z", "full_text": "Hello all !!\nI have been lurking on the board for awhile, feeling not much to \ncontribute.\nI am interested in this connection and communication (Thanks to \nDebbie !!)\nI&#39;ve observed a few things on the board.  Somehow this word &quot;purple&quot; \nkeeps popping up and I can&#39;t help but to think of the color purple in \nthe spectrum.  Does the color relate to some sort of sound wave \nalso ? or correlates to something in the electronic field that your \nhelpers from the other side are trying to propose ?\n\nAlso, I have noticed that the Frank boxes do not seem to be \ndistributed to many women (is this because women do not have good \nresults with the other side ?)\nI know Debbie has done a lot of successful work, but, does this mean \nthat women have a more difficult time with communication ?\n\nI don&#39;t have a box and I don&#39;t know how to build one !! I went to \nradio shack and whatever was recommended is replaced with the new 470.\n\nI don&#39;t know where to begin except that Frank recommended starting \nwith EVPMAKER.  I&#39;d like to build something of my own and don&#39;t know \nwhere to start with a receiver/scanner of my own.\nI&#39;d be so happy if someone could share some technology with me !!!??\nthanks, Holly"}
