I didn&#39;t post it earlier because I didn&#39;t think  \n&gt; it was clear enough, but I offer it now anyway, since its the first  \n&gt; real &quot;cosmic&quot; box communication we&#39;ve gotten. It was not in  \n&gt; response to any question. The file is slowed by about 40 percent. I  \n&gt; believe it says, &quot;Look for life; look for death.&quot; The final word  \n&gt; may be the name Kate. I&#39;m not sure. It&#39;s the first part that  \n&gt; intrigues me.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Shed those extra pounds with MSN and The Biggest Loser! Learn more.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nI su e was easy o hack, B uce.
