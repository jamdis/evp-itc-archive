<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank,
Personally, I agree with the protection, but I do NOT BELIEVE there is
anyone ONLY meant to do what you claim or anyone else that claims
their the best for communicating with spirit this way! or any other way.

I for one have been doing this stuff for 18 years and I have never
said allot, but that got my goat, end of story. I know that this type
of communication and use of radios has been going on since 1988 and
you stepped up to the plate and improved on the original process. 
But, balanced people are strongly encouraged to always be aware of the
emotional and mental issues that can possibly happen. Now for the UN
BALANCED? Well, you have all experienced the results. So, lets drop
the issue and get on with our spirituality and growth and learn more,
and have fun doing it at the same dern time.

&gt;  Hi All; We have been warned by others from time to time about
unbridled box use, as it supposedly brings in negativity. I don&#x27;t want
to believe that, but there are a few cases of people using boxes made
by me, as well as the hack radios, and going whacko big time. Its&#x27;
either all ego--I&#x27;m the onlyest one that can use this, or like the
more recent example. I don&#x27;t know if these people were like this to
start, or if it&#x27;s an external influance, but it&#x27;s discouraging. There
seems to be a similar reaction with systems not made by me--so I&#x27;ve
been told.
&gt;  
&gt;  Soooo, maybe burn some white candles, and maybe get a Rosary. My
guys talk about the Catholics, and the Purple Princess has a Catholic
connection on the etheric levels, although the church imposes too many
limits on her. I wouldn&#x27;t want to go into a state of fear, but a
little protection stuff couldn&#x27;t hurt. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Not only do I not have the time to mass produce boxes, I&#x27;m
beginning to think it&#x27;s not a good idea anyway.
