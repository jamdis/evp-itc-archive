<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Frank, don&#x27;t know if touch is important. There seems to be a &#x27;field&#x27; associated with the process so I don&#x27;t know for sure if physical contact with the tuner is required or even helps.  I found another voice towards the start of the same session. This is a slower talker but to my ears the same voice throughout. I hear a male voice and this does require some mental filtering of the high frequency noise. The time that the message is spoken is important because I would have tuned across at least half the FM broadcast band during the message segment.

This stuff  never ceases to amaze me! I have my add on sweep board ready, 
but I wonder just how important is the human touch on the radio. I was 
thinking about adding a plate connected to the circuit ground that I just 
touch while recording.

I haven&#x27;t heard much about those &quot;stations&quot; in other cities, and countries 
for a few years. I still get them once in a while. I think I spend way too 
much time putting boards together, and don&#x27;t get time to play. This voice 
even sounds like a British accent.

&gt;Thanks for the feedback Frank you have a good ear for these messages. Tried 
&gt;something different tonight. I have a small tesla coil in the basement that 
&gt;I can run powered mainly by audio (music). This creates broadband noise on 
&gt;both AM and FM bands on my upstairs tuner. his is a capture doing a sweep 
&gt;tuning of the FM band while the Tesla coil was running.
&gt;&quot;We heard along from Tesla that one human&#x27;s going to be testing&quot;
&gt;
&gt;The chatter indicates the message is coming from a control point in London!

&gt;I don&#x27;t know, could be, to me it sounds like &quot;Our Chris-he is giving our
&gt;reception&quot;, like maybe they are trying to say Chris is getting these guys.

&gt; &gt;Frank, I got this tonight and it sounds like the same voice swept through
&gt; &gt;several station channels. Could they be talking about the Christopher who
&gt; &gt;uses one of your boxes?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&quot;Our Chris.....Is giving a reception&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; WOW!! I am amazed that someonme actually tried this! It does work.
&gt; &gt;There was
&gt; &gt; &gt; a Danish(I think) researcher doing the same thing, but never could
&gt; &gt;make
&gt; &gt; &gt; contact with them. I have done this myself, and it can work wiht TV
&gt; &gt;too, if
&gt; &gt; &gt; you can switch channels fast ennough. I think you could use a
&gt; &gt;steeper motor
&gt; &gt; &gt; controler to randomly turn a stepper moter, to turn the dial.
&gt; &gt;Manually
&gt; &gt; &gt; spinning the dial has one advantage, the sound is clearer! I have
&gt; &gt;yet to see
&gt; &gt; &gt; a method of ITC that produces better results that the random tuning
&gt; &gt;methods.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning
&gt; &gt;system. I tried
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner through the
&gt; &gt;AM band
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the dial moving at a
&gt; &gt;constant
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;rate of speed. This is not nearly as good as Frank&#x27;s &#x27;hands off&#x27;
&gt; &gt;random
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;tuning method but it still produced some results. What impressed
&gt; &gt;me most is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that some of the voices sound the same, even though I tuned
&gt; &gt;through several
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;channels. This attached capture could be a technical message.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Plug a million hertz&quot;   One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which
&gt; &gt;is close
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.
