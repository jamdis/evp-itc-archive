<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Mike,

Sure, I have no problem with you, or anyone else who participated, 
sharing their files with the other researchers here.

Thanks!

&gt; Iam just wondering how long you have been doing I.T.C/E.V.P 
research 
&gt; and analasis Iam one of the 8 researchers Mike asked to help him in 
his 
&gt; project. The files he posted are his own. As for my files I am 
still 
&gt; working on them and after I send them to Mike and he is ok with me 
&gt; sharing them I have no problem posting them or sending them to you. 
I 
&gt; would be very interested in your opinion. On the other hand I have 
many 
&gt; files you may find interesting I am currently working on putting 
them 
&gt; up on esnips http://www.esnips.com/web/nightparanormalresearchsStuff
&gt; thats the link to a couple and theres more to come in the future. 
enjoy
&gt; back to my original question how long have you been involved with 
I.T.C 
&gt; and what is your favorite method of capturing I.T.C.
&gt; 
&gt;                       Thanx Mike W.
