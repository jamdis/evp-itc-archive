          Hi Rhonda .. It's nice to meet you! I turn the dial really fast back 
and forth .. (fast enough so that no words can be heard). DC6 is a 
recording program which allows you to hear the played-back version of 
what you're recording with about a 1/4 of a second delay. 

Stephan .. It's nice to meet you also!!It wasn't actually "LIVE" .. I 
was listening to them speak with headphones as DC6 was processing the 
file. DC6 enables you to carry on an Evp conversation. Hope I'm 
explaining this right .. It's not the radio speaking real-time. 

Thanks so much for listening!

Debbie
