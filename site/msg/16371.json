Last night was an episode entitled &quot;Ghost Box Prophecies&quot; where a paranormal team was called in in to investigate a haunting at a family home.  They used a hacked Radio Shack 469 (you can hear the clicking sound throughout).  What the shack hack predicted, however, seemingly came true.  This was the 3rd episode in the new series - it repeats this week, as do the first two episodes.  Attached below are 2 links:  One for the program and the second link for the extended schedule where they replay the episodes.
