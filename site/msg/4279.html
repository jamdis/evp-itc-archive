<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I listened to an internet radio show yesterday where Mr. Moran was a 
guest.  He spoke about sending his field researchers out with mini-
boxes to schools, nursing homes, colleges, etc.  He was very open 
about it on the show.  He advised the audience that he wanted to get 
opinions about the box from all walks of life.  I don&#x27;t think this is 
something he is trying to hide...???

Many of us our researchers here, and I think we would love to have 
our experimental devices tested by others.  Speaking of that, did you 
ever ask Mr. Moon to try the Radio Shack Hack 12-469/mixer setup I 
put together?  I seem to recall asking you to ask him a while back.

I would like his opinion on how it works for him. I don&#x27;t think he 
will melt or anything by using it...

&gt; A few weeks ago I posted that Rick Moran had written an article
&gt; stating that children and high school students would be part of the
&gt; testing subjects of the mini-box. Later that day the article was
&gt; replaced with a different article about the mini-box. I was told 
that
&gt; I was stating mis truths. I wasn&#x27;t. I finally was able to locate the
&gt; missing article. I&#x27;m providing a link to the entire article along 
with
&gt; the statement regarding our children. If the link somehow becomes
&gt; unavailable, I have done a screen shot and will provide it to 
whoever
&gt; asks.
&gt; Believe me when I say that this isn&#x27;t to cause or stir crap. I was
&gt; basically called a liar and this clears up that misconception. If I 
am
&gt; banned from this group for telling the truth, than so be it. 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;...it was not the question of whether the phenomenon existed to 
begin
&gt; with, but rather what is the phenomenon.  That will require a good
&gt; deal more effort to explore and beginning in January we will be
&gt; undertaking test sessions all over north and east Texas as well as
&gt; other national locations with a wide variety of folks to see what
&gt; happens within the group dynamic.  The testing will include folks 
who
&gt; are both believers and non-believers, skeptics, critics, other
&gt; researchers, children, high school students, college and grad
&gt; students, and senior citizens to name a few categories.&quot;

&gt; Are you willing to &quot;see what happens&quot; with our children?
