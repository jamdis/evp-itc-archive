Subject: [EVP-ITC] Thanks Juli!

I just wanted to offer a public thank you to Juli for inviting me 
into the recording group she participates in. I'm excited to join in 
but am experiencing some minor technical difficulties at the moment.

ACK! I have no radio reception! I'm out in the boonies and my house 
backs right up to a tree-covered hill. I'm going to have to find 
another private place to do my research.

I had to tag along on errands with hubby and son this afternoon and 
brought my RS 470 and digital recorder with me for the ride. You 
shoulda seen their reactions when I started asking the radio 
questions in the car! My son said I was scaring him (geez, he's 19), 
and my husband said I was like one of the bag ladies we see walking 
down the street talking to herself. They're both disappointed in me 
for not having a more acceptable hobby like knitting. I stayed in 
the car recording when they went into the store, and then I noticed 
there was this woman in the car next to me who had been staring at me 
open-mouthed for God knows how long. I haven't uploaded the 
recording to the computer yet, but really don't think I got anything 
besides radio fragment.

Speaking of that, the scan rate seems pretty fast, and yet the 
stations each hold for several seconds, so I get more like complete 
sentences than broadcast "fragments." 

Do you think some people are chosen to be researchers in this field? 
I guess I'm feeling a little discouraged right now, but I'll figure 
this out soon. 

Robin
