<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Are you trying to create a video loop?  I&#x27;m not real technical so maybe someone can 
clarify... it&#x27;s not the camera or the TV, it&#x27;s both. I think the snow actually has some color in 
it that our eyes don&#x27;t pick up normally, but when the camera zooms in, it changes how the 
snow is seen.

If you are trying for video loop ITC images, you want the video out of the camera 
connected to the video in of the TV, making it so the camera is seeing/recording it&#x27;s own 
output (there shouldn&#x27;t be any snow at all).  You want to slowly zoom in while doing this.

You can poke around on YouTube and find people&#x27;s examples of what this looks like.

&gt; hi,
&gt; 
&gt; i have been experimenting recently with a video camera, aimed at the 
&gt; television, with the television on  a &#x27;no signal&#x27; channel.
&gt; 
&gt; all you see is static/snow on it.
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, i had the vid camera running, and it has a zoom feature, so 
&gt; while it was recordng,i zoomed in and the result was a ton of color 
&gt; flashes, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; when i take the zoom off, it goes back to the static/snow...
&gt; 
&gt; again, is this the camera or tv?
