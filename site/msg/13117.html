I would know by the content=
. As a ham radio operator, I could identify 
anything said as being from th=
at source. (Frank S is also a ham.) CB 
transmissions would also be easy to=
 identify by the content.

And when I ask a question like "Are there others=
 here with you?" and get 
an answer like "You bet," or if I ask "Are you ha=
ppy?" and get a response 
"Course I'm happy" (actual EVP's I've gotten), it=
's a pretty good chance 
those are exact answers to the questions I asked.
=

As for the radio station, it was a continuous recording on mine. I could 
=
hear the DJ talking, the intros to the music he gave, the music, the 
conne=
rcials, everything. I doubt you are only going to get a single word 
or few=
 words from a radio station close by if it is getting into your 
unit. And =
I suspect a ghost isn't going to be doing an ad for the local 
car dealer!
=

Also, I didn't mention in my last post that I tried the experiment with my=
 
recorder within a couple blocks and then at increasing distances from the=
 
radio station towers. At a quarter mile away or more I couldn't hear it i=
n 
the recording. I also tried the local police and some microwave towers, =

right under the towers, and heard nothing from those sources. But they 
ar=
e on much higher frequencies than AM or FM radio and are not known to 
get =
into any electronics around here.
