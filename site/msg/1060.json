Volume has to be adjusted so the mic does not overload, it is \na touchy adjustment of audio and flame level. If the flame is set too \nhigh the unit generates lots of noise from the flutter of the flame. \nAlso the room should be dark and computer monitor turned down to \nreduce noise the mic will pick up produced stray light sources.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- franks-boxes@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Optical?\n&gt; Date: Thu, 05 Apr 2007 13:17:13 -0600\n&gt; \n&gt; So you play the audio from the radio out in the room, and record \nwith the \n&gt; optic setup?\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Exercise your brain!
