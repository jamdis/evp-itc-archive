It is just a matter of being around someone with something to\n&gt; say. Also, I don&#39;t think the location really has that much to do with\n&gt; it either. I can get recording from my house almost as easily as a\n&gt; &quot;haunted&quot; location.

The only editing I do is adjusting the gain and cutting\n&gt; out parts of the recording that catch my interest.
