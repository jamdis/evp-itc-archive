Well, I have some info from the peanut gallery, most is high pitched so  
many of you guys won't understand it, signing type angel files, I didn't want 
to  believe how a mother could kill her own child, but it seems she did the  
deed.  Seems from what the angels say, the grandma and mom Casey got into a 
 fight, Casey was mad so when the parents were gone, she put the baby into 
the  truck, and closed the lid, she may have been tied so she couldn't get 
out and or  druged.  In one of the files, you can hear Caylee crying for her 
mama, she  stills asks for her mother, and the angels are saying, that 
"Christ holds the  baby"  I have lots of files now, there are but a few.  I think 
the  spirit say, her mother will "get life." sf
