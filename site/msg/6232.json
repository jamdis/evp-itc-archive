How you\nrecord and what you use.  What is plugged into what and so forth?\nThanks\nRob.\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot;\n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; hey,\n&gt; \n&gt; I did a MB session today and asked for Ms. Estep.\n&gt; Mike and lisa were kind enough to bring her forward and help with the \n&gt; communication. I believe she is still adjusting to being on the other \n&gt; side and has not fully grasped how to send communication from the other \n&gt; side, with an array of different boxes to work with.\n&gt; \n&gt; I asked about the prior message concerning her whistle statement, the \n&gt; answer I recieved was &quot;they whistled often&quot; I&#39;m assuming she meant her \n&gt; spirit contacts.\n&gt; \n&gt; The files are posted in a sub folder marked MB_files in my main folder\n&gt; Bruces box files. In the future all sub folders for different box files \n&gt; will be in this sub folder.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks guy&#39;s\n&gt; \n&gt; bruce\n&gt;"}
