My problem is as you said...the BS, like "you'll go crazy if you try to spe=
ak with the dead." He has no real evidence to back that statement up. It is=
 purely just his belief.

If he said, "In my opinion...." or " I believe...=
" then I would still disagree, but it wouldn't put a burr under my blanket =
LOL!

EVP-ITC] Anyone else offended by C2C?


    This is why I tell everyone don=
't take my word for it try it for yourself. Communication with something be=
yond yourself is a personal endeavor. Stephen Rorke makes his living on hoa=
x news and to him this is news. I can't blame anyone for questioning the re=
ality around them. But I can take a look at what else a person has had to c=
ontribute to the world and the feild of study they claim to be in.  I sugge=
st you all do the same before you take someones ideas and make them your ow=
n. He has a right to form his own opinion, experiment and get his own resul=
ts, and believe whatever he wishes. But so do I.

        Based on my own e=
xperiments, my own results, my own experiences, I form MY own opinions and =
beliefs. As for the spiricom communication device all I can say is its inte=
resting but I was not there, I did not experiement with it, I have no resul=
ts with which to base an opinion on. All we have left is some recorded data=
, and heresay.

        As for Frank's box and Sweep Tuning I can say I hav=
e seen the results, I have experimented with ST myself and I have received =
some astounding results which are message communications that are outside o=
f my own knowledge and my own ability to control or create. I have used man=
y methods for EVP and ITC and have had many interesting results that have b=
een confirmed, recognized, and proved beyond a shadow of MY own doubt. This=
 is MY personal experience and I invite anyone who wishes to know more to t=
ry it for themselves and get their own results rather than waste time tryin=
g to pick apart others ideas, theories or results. I never try and prove an=
ything to anyone else because for each of us it takes that one very persona=
l experience to have that eye opening moment and realize that there is more=
 around us than what is apparent.

        So no I am not offended by anyth=
ing anyone has to say as long as they base thier statements on truth rather=
 than BS. And we all know there are alot of people who make their life revo=
lve around the BS as well as try to profit from it.

        My best advice=
 would be to try it in depth before you form an opinion. Your results may d=
iffer from others, your personal experience may not be the same but that is=
 YOUR experience, not mine, to explore further.

        My journey has bee=
n quite fascinating, educational, and enlightening. I could only hope that =
everyone else has a similar path, but we each have our own roads to travel.=
