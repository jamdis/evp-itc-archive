It&#39;s really sweet of you to make yourself so available to people, \nbut if you have members take inquiries of this nature off the boards by having them \ncontact your privately, you are limiting the amount of learning that can take place.  There \nare likely &quot;lurkers&quot; here, who will never join or come forward, but could really benefit from \nLyn&#39;s questions and the answers she receives from the group.  \n\nTaking communication privately also eliminates the possibility for her to receive multiple \nopinions.  (not to imply there isn&#39;t a time for privacy!)  ;0)\n\nLike I said, just a thought.  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lyn,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I would be happy to help you and answer any questions you have.\n&gt; you can e-mail me if you like\n&gt;  \n&gt; paranormalinvestigating@...\n&gt;  \n&gt; any time\n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: ITCdeadpeople@...: Sun, 30 Mar 2008 20:09:51 +0000Subject: [EVP-\nITC] Re: EVP questions_can anyone help ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Lyn.
