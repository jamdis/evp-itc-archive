You did get responses that the whole group could witness and participate in.  I would guess the outcome would be quite different for participants if the message could only be heard by the conductor or the messages were not readily discernible.  I am not doing group presentations...yet...and I would hesitate at this point to share a session with other than my wife, who already knows I&#39;m out there.

The other reason was because I want to \nintroduce a techie type friend to this whole phenomena and I thought \nyour presentation would be a good starting point. After watching \nyour video you satisfied my first interest, but I chose not to refer \nmy friend to the video. I found the video to be very interesting \nand I was only a little disappointed that responses to your questions \ndid not come across to my ear.

I felt that \nsomeone who did not previously know about the successful sessions \nthat so many researchers have had here, would have experienced a guy \ntalking to himself or, worse yet, asking\n&gt; questions to a radio and then answering himself. Again, I think \nsomeone who takes the time to see such a presentation also wants to \nsee the results. After all, getting a message from the other end is \nthe purpose of what&#39;s being done.
