Also I must say there are two kinds of \n =\r\n fear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion for self \n  preserva=\r\ntion, ie the fright and flight reflex that is an instinctive \n  trait in al=\r\nl of us.

Then you have the irrational \n  dibilitating phobic &lt;BR&gt;fear =\r\nthat can turn an individual into a frozen statue. \n  That type of &lt;BR&gt;fear =\r\nI believe is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt \n  with and &lt;BR&gt;lea=\r\nrned how to harness. I also believe that anyone that harbors \n  that &lt;BR&gt;ty=\r\npe of fear would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a \n  &lt;BR&gt;case=\r\n of such fear it would already be present and doing a small \n  &lt;BR&gt;protecti=\r\non ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take it for \n  &lt;BR&gt;what it=\r\n is, something to utilize in our box of tools like an emf \n  &lt;BR&gt;meter.you =\r\nmay have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the bottom of &lt;BR&gt;your \n  tool bo=\r\nx at home that you inherited from your grandfather and &lt;BR&gt;have never \n  us=\r\nedbut if you come across that odd nut that needs &lt;BR&gt;tightening somedsy you=\r\n \n  will be glad you have it.Bruce&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Need to know the score,=\r\n the \n  latest news, or you need your Hotmail=AE-&lt;BR&gt;get your &quot;fix&quot; Check i=\r\nt out. \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  ____________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;________=\r\n_&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Climb to the top of the char=\r\nts!&nbsp; Play the word scramble challenge \n  &lt;BR&gt;with star power.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;A title=3Dhttp://club.live.com/star_shuffle.aspx? \n  href=3D&quot;http://club.l=\r\nive.com/star_shuffle.aspx?&quot;&gt;http://club.&lt;WBR&gt;live.com/&lt;WBR&gt;star_shuffle.&lt;WB=\r\nR&gt;aspx?&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;icid=3Dstarshuffle_&lt;WBR&gt;wlmailtextlink_&lt;WBR&gt;jan&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00DF_01C859E8.16043B80--"}
