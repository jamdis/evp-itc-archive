Your boyfriend&#39;s opinion is one of the reasons why I put great weight on relevance \nof content in a session.  For example, when I recently asked for Rees&#39; great uncle to say \nhis name, and an immediate reply of &quot;It&#39;s Chuck Clarke&quot; is heard (even though Rees \nreferred to him as Charlie, both are nicknames for Charles) I think the odds would be quite \nastronomical of that being coincidence.  Same goes for any of us asking a question, any \nquestion, and receiving a relevant response ... it would be highly unlikely for it to be from \nstray signals (of whatever flavor.)  \n\nThen again, if he has trouble even hearing and/or agreeing on the content, it&#39;s going to be \nhard for you to get him to view an answer as relevant, even when it is.  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have let my boyfriend listen to some of my files. He cant seem to \n&gt; hear anything. (He is a bit hard of hearing) he is saying what we are \n&gt; hearing is skip from a cb radio or skip in general. Any imput on this? \n&gt; \n&gt; Kay\n&gt;"}
