Have you\nreceived them?\n\nAnn\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ralph Smith&quot; &lt;Ralphsmi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ann,\n&gt; \n&gt;  I sent you an email I don&#39;t know if recieved it yet or not about the \n&gt; Chadds Ford case. Our group would be interested in seeing if we can \n&gt; help them. Also with any help from people in this group. Just wanted \n&gt; to see what you think about it. Our group pays strict attention to all\n&gt; privacy. I have learned alot from a Podcast on Ghost to Ghost PM with \n&gt; Mike Coletta and his guest Bruce Halliday about the Ghost Box and \n&gt; opening a portal with the thing that I emailed about. The shadowy \n&gt; figure that followed me home that I think came through the Box. Oh \n&gt; well Ann have a great day and everyone on here too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Ralph Smith\n&gt; Spirit Paranormal Investigation Team of Central PA\n&gt;"}
