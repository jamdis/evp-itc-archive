Hi Vicki,
I haven't had enough success with DRV to explain my method.  When=
 I did my last session the radio was on 610 AM I could hear bursts of stati=
c ever so often that ended up being them speaking.  It was really cool.  I =
was standing up and it felt like the wind was being sucked out through my h=
eart chakra and solar plexus.  Not really an unpleasant feeling, but next t=
ime I'm gonna sit down to see if that helps.

Good Luck :)

  Hi Jo=
dy (and Frank)--I'm interested in how you are conducting you DRV sessions. =
 Could you give me a breif explanation?  I'd really like to start trying th=

ty is trying to say more than hello, but I can't quite make it out.  There'=
s a lot of noise around here today, lawnmowers, etc.  Thanks, Vicki

       Speaking of radio, I got a voice that I didn't copy to the=

       I have the RVG side of a second micro system working. I don't thi=

      I agree but if it is them th=
