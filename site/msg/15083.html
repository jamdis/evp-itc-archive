There are receiver=

Here is some food for thought. I am curren=

=C2=A0
It was me an=

voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry with me. We were standing r=

 girl that was with me to check her recording to see if she picked it up.
=
=C2=A0
I have long felt the true EVP does not come from sound waves in the =
environment, or then it wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow E=
VP's are appearing directly on the recordings.
=C2=A0
This instance with th=
e recorders may back that theory up. That other recorder should have picked=
 that voice up if it were sound waves in the environment.
=C2=A0
I am attac=

 Clip" is the full clip.=C2=A0You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", and t=
hen another comes in right after that. I think I know what it says.
=C2=A0

Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear this until pl=

I have a running theory that =
EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they wan=
t it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ult=
rasonic waves that differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtr=
act them together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For exam=
ple, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan i=
n a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a int=
ermediate difference=C2=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing rang=
e (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic equipment g=
enerates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I alw=
ays felt that EVP were generated within a few inches of the recorder.
=C2=

We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radio with superhetero=
dyne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars an=
d a commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.

<div>I have a running theory that EVP is c=
arried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to =
manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic =
waves that differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them=
 together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if =
a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room=
 creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediat=
e difference frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz =
to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates=
 ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt=
 that EVP were generated within a few inches of the recorder.</div>
<div>&n=
bsp;</div>
<div>We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radio with=
 superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some passi=
ve sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Jose=
ph Pompeii.</div>
