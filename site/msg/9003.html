Super clear Bruce.  I am back into the amazement camp with the responses your are getting.  Great messages, all having meaning I would like to understand.  Interesting they refer to "DOWN THERE" which I would take to mean they are above asi in the sky or North as in New York.  Possibly some relief they are not below.  I also like the KINGS message...I take to mean the communications coming from you and others in the group are at a high level in their minds.  What's with the table message?  I really like the fill sentences that are coming to you from this system.   Also the clarity.  Sacrafice the voice intonations heard on other EVP forms but that seems to be made up by clarity and subtle humor sent out.  great stuff   Ron L
