As I mentioned earlier, ordinarily I would just send a private message \nto people on eBay when I saw something crazy going on, but about 2 weeks ago \n(guessing) eBay disabled the ability for anyone but the seller to contact bidders, due to all \nthe scammers out there trying to rip off people.  \n\nKind of a bummer, but as a buyer, I appreciate the protection, as I&#39;ve received many bogus \noffers in the past and found it quite annoying.  \n\nI&#39;ve never sold anything on eBay, or Craigslist, so don&#39;t know the ins and outs of it all.  I&#39;ll \nleave that up to you experienced folks to list whatever, if that is what you choose to do.  If \nnot, that&#39;s OK too!  :-)\n\nMargaret  \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, psfponies &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Margaret \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Yes I saw what Frank and Bruce wrote I am taking it all in, trying to figure the best way \nto handle this. I know some are opposed to doing anything and some are for it. And of \ncourse being a newbie to both the group and evps I respect what everyone has to say. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Think I am going to sleep on it and look more into it tomorrow. And as a group figure \nout what is best for all.  I think I personally got caught up in the hype of seeing someone \nsticking it to so many people. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Kay\n&gt; \n&gt; itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   Hi Kay. Just wanting to make sure you saw Frank&#39;s post. His concern being that we \nmight \n&gt; wipe out the 12-469 availability. Maybe you could mention all the models, or none of \n&gt; them (just be more generic in the ad). This way, people can be drawn to one model or \n&gt; another naturally, rather than being guided toward the 12-469 (which honestly, I think \nthe \n&gt; click-click-clicking on the new version is a distraction). \n&gt; \n&gt; If I were to start from scratch, looking at all the choices, I would have gone with the 12-\n&gt; 820 first. It&#39;s great that additional models have been discovered to be hackable. Thanks \n&gt; much to those who have brought this information to our attention!\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here is a mock ad I made to put up on ebay.

All you need to do is go to your \n&gt; &gt; local Radio Shack and pick up the 12-469 Digital AM/FM Pocket Radio \n&gt; &gt; for ONLY $24.99 plus tax and with a simple modification. You will \n&gt; &gt; have your very own cheap alternative to a &quot;GHOST BOX&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (I will insert a picture of the RS 12-469 here)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This simple modification lets the radio sweep both the AM and FM \n&gt; &gt; band. Instead of it scanning and stopping on a station, doing the \n&gt; &gt; modification (clipping the &quot;Mute&quot; pin) lets it just sweep the entire \n&gt; &gt; band, without stopping on any station. Just hook your Radio up to \n&gt; &gt; some speakers or headphones and while the radio is sweeping the \n&gt; &gt; bands start asking questions and get answers in real time. You can \n&gt; &gt; also record it and review it later for answers you may have missed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are several sites for the FREE instructions on how to modify \n&gt; &gt; your Radio Shack 12-469.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://ufogeek.com/?p=81\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozhaY1fW3s4 part 1\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2ZLABu0rK0 part 2\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For more information from the &quot;Experts&quot; on Ghost Boxes and EVPS you \n&gt; &gt; can also go to:\n&gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good luck and happy ghost hunting!!!!!!!!!!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
