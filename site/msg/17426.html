<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t  mind others hearing this stuff different, or not at all, and so is
pure imagination or wishfull thinking. What I don not like is these personal
attacks because what I post does not agree with some cherished beliefs.  I
mostly post post to show what I&#x27;m doing and using. These people that can not
accept anything as evidence can go somewhere else to post their views.

&gt; How much do you trust your own observations? How certain are you of what
&gt; you see and hear and don&#x27;t see and hear? I think it comes down to that.
&gt;
&gt; People with a lot of uncertainty may claim things like &quot;pareidolia&quot; or
&gt; whatever, but if you have the certainty and confidence to say you hear this
&gt; or that, then you really don&#x27;t care.
&gt;
&gt; No doubt some people DO fall pray to pareidolia (whatever that is) but I&#x27;m
&gt; not one of them. I do have to wonder about the people who see &quot;orbs&quot; in
&gt; every photo but don&#x27;t know enough about photography to say whether they may
&gt; in fact be something uusual or not. I&#x27;m not one of them.
&gt;
&gt; I think it&#x27;s a good idea to put the audio clips up here for others to
&gt; listen to. Others may hear something different. That doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re
&gt; wrong in your initial interpretation. You&#x27;re free to agree with the other
&gt; person and revise what you say you hear. And you&#x27;re free not to.
&gt;
&gt; Does this make sense or do I need more coffee this morning?

&gt;&gt; That person is no longer allowed ot contribute! I&#x27;ve had it with these
&gt;&gt; nasty negative attacks when we present--at least to us--what seems to be
&gt;&gt; evidence, and/or discuss various methods and techniques. These &quot;skeptics&quot;
&gt;&gt; accept no evidence and basically call anyone doing this research either
&gt;&gt; crazy or liars. They have no place on this group, this group is not about
&gt;&gt; gettng accpetable evidence, or the &quot;proof&quot; that will play in some air head
&gt;&gt; university, it&#x27;s about exploring something that is real and demonstratable.
&gt;&gt; I do think for myself and I don&#x27;t need some duffus to tell me what is
&gt;&gt; acceptable to think about.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; It seems to me that simply being on this list and taking these
&gt;&gt; discoveries seriously, we already ARE thinking for ourselves.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Seriously, why would anyone use/waste time on this subject (and this
&gt;&gt; list) if he or she wanted the safety of accepted, mainstream, dogmatic
&gt;&gt; thinking? (Rhetorical question.)
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I understand that some people feel obliged to play &quot;Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot;
&gt;&gt; with new and extraordinary theories and R&amp;D, but it seems to me that the
&gt;&gt; Devil has enough advocates, thank you.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Healthy skepticism is one thing. All I&#x27;m seeing here is compelling
&gt;&gt; evidence supporting EVP/ITC, followed by attempts to shout down the
&gt;&gt; concepts.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; It looks like you&#x27;re attacking the messenger. I don&#x27;t think this is the
&gt;&gt; right forum for that... if any is.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; However, since I&#x27;m new to this Yahoo Group, maybe I misunderstood what
&gt;&gt; this group is about.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Bemused,
&gt;&gt; &gt; Fiona
