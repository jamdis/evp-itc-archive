 A couple voices from just now testign another car tuner. I have veryu few=
 of these, and out of four I had in the junk box, only two work. These are =
weak, almost like regular EVP. Rigel is one that comes through every once i=
n awhile, not sure if that his name, or home, as sometimes he says "this is=
 your friend from Rigel"
 
 It's still looking like the sound chamber is co=
mpletely un needed, and may even hamper the voices. What I get form the Gho=
stman, and even directly from a tuenr module is easier to understand that t=
he ones through an sound chamber and mic amplifiers. the Gostman in direct =
mode yields longs, and more coherent voices than the original box, at least=
 compared to what I was getting last night.
Tonight I'll modifiy #32 to get=
 either direct recordings out of the tuner, or through the sound chamber so=
 I can compare.  I had one from 2/5/08 from the Ghostman that said "that Ea=
rthquake will occur-------on the island near Chile (Falklands?).  There was=
 a EQ today off Brazil, but no island there.
