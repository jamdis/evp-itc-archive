Thank you Ann and Misty, and after only 4 posts I got feedback from two people.
 
The reason I wanted this specific file to be heard was that I thought it was perfect validation
that at least some of our human physical emotions stay with us when we cross.
 
I was looking for someone to pick up and comment on that.

          Here is a perfect example of my "Technition" Lisa getting frustrated
with me asking the same question like 4 times due to the fact that I
usually hear the answer to this question live but did not this time.

when I finally did she said "Yes" in a like sort of "ok enough already"
tone of voice.

the file goes "any spirit came threw can you let me know if they are
back_YESSSSSS.wav

Also this is a question I ask due to the fact that I believe entities
can travel back and forth across the open line of live communication.
