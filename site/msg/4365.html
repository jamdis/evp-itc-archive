<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce, I think I asked this before, but what microphone are you using 
and how is everything plugged together?  If I understand correctly, 
you are using an older 12-470 with a mic in front of it recording you 
and the built-in speaker, correct?  Your earlier recordings sounded 
like a studio mic or something - very nice.

I have been playing with the Listen Up mic into the recorder, as well 
as a lapel mic.  You seem to have less static...I am going to go 
listen to your latest uploads and let you know what I think.
