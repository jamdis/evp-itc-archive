<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

here&#x27;s a screenshot of the CwGet program while decoding the morse code
produced by EVPmaker + morse.wav:

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Stefan/Morse%20code/cwget_screenshot.png

The only &quot;meaningful&quot; message I could get in a 1 minute session was
&quot;I am&quot;.

Since morse codes are precise, there is not much room for variations
like with the allophones which are &quot;decoded&quot; by our flexible hearing, so
the gain of meaningful messages will be much less here. But nevertheless
I think it&#x27;s worth to experiment with it.

&gt; Hi Steve,

&gt; the CW decoder gets mainly the letters E, I and T.
&gt; I also noticed that the beeps are all the same length in your file.

&gt; So I made a raw audio file for EVPmaker that contains three cues: The
&gt; &quot;dit&quot; and &quot;dah&quot; beeps, and an &quot;intra-character gap&quot;:

&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Stefan/Morse%20code/morse.wav

&gt; The &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option must be checked in EVPmaker to use this file.

&gt; Now it sounds a bit more like actual morse code, and CwGet is able to
&gt; decode more letters. Perhaps some former ham operators &quot;over there&quot; are
&gt; able to use it... :)
