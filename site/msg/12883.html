<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Good post I like the theory that both men had some involvement with the spirit world. I had heard some time back that Edisons comments were meant as a joke to a reporter, mocking Tesla for statements he had made about disincarnate voices. So many rumors floating around about those two its sad that they didnt get along better. I can only imagine what they would have accomplished as a team rather than bitter rivals.

You should definitely return and try again, perhaps some of the old energy still lingers there.

&gt; Greetings fellow researchers,
&gt; 
&gt; While listening to the Coast to Coast AM radio show last
&gt; night I heard
&gt; something that was very interesting and surprising. The
&gt; guest during the
&gt; hours I listened was Tim Swartz, and he was talking about
&gt; the &#x27;lost
&gt; journals&#x27; of Nikola Tesla.
&gt; During the conversation Swartz mentioned that Tesla, while
&gt; living in
&gt; Colorado Springs, had radio reception equipment on which he
&gt; received
&gt; signals he did not believe were terrestrial. Some of those
&gt; signals even
&gt; contained speech, in english. Tim Swartz made a comment
&gt; during the show
&gt; that associated Nikola Tesla with EVPs. Awesome!
&gt; 
&gt; Now... we all have heard that that Thomas Edison was the
&gt; guy who was
&gt; thought to have been the one with an association with what
&gt; may have been
&gt; EVPs and an actual device for contacting them, but could it
&gt; be that
&gt; Nikola Tesla is the guy who really should be given the
&gt; credit for that?
&gt; Do these &#x27;lost journals&#x27;, now found, have details
&gt; or data which provide
&gt; documented proof that Tesla may have been communicating...
&gt; or at least
&gt; listening to communication from beyond.
&gt; 
&gt; If it wasn&#x27;t terrestrial in his opinion, I would
&gt; imagine he considered
&gt; them to be extra terrestrial or possibly inner terrestrial.
&gt; 
&gt; What is really cool from my vantage point... I live only
&gt; three minutes
&gt; from where Nikola Tesla would have done those experiments
&gt; and made that
&gt; communication contact. His lab was located on a hill within
&gt; a 3 minute
&gt; drive; a place I have visited numerous times and attempted
&gt; to capture
&gt; EVP at.
&gt; 
&gt; It was when I first started my interest/investigation in
&gt; EVP that I went
&gt; to where the Tesla lab was, and using a simple device I
&gt; constructed,
&gt; tried my luck at EVP capture.
&gt; Now that I have a number of other devices to use, and now
&gt; that I know
&gt; that Tesla may have been the pioneer in EVP discovery, I
&gt; will probably
&gt; go back there with my devices and make some additional
&gt; attempts.   Cool
&gt; stuff...!!!
&gt; Here&#x27;s a short excerpt from the Swartz book regarding
&gt; Tesla and the
&gt; EVPs:
&gt; 
&gt; Chapter 5 - Tesla and Electronic Voice Phenomena
&gt; 
&gt; No one can deny that computers and electronics have forever
&gt; changed our
&gt; way of life. There are electronic controls and computer
&gt; chips in
&gt; everything from the small appliances that toast our bread
&gt; to the cars we
&gt; drive, and make possible myriad forms of new entertainment,
&gt; from VCRs
&gt; and DVDs to video games and talking stuffed toys.
&gt; 
&gt; For a number of years some people have claimed that
&gt; electronics can be
&gt; useful in a quite unexpected way: to contact the dead, or
&gt; at least allow
&gt; the dead to contact us. Obviously, these claims are highly
&gt; controversial. They make many assumptions: that there is
&gt; life after
&gt; death, that the dead are interested in contacting us, and
&gt; that they have
&gt; the means by which to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; The mysterious signals that Tesla received could be linked
&gt; to what is
&gt; now known as Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP). Tesla was
&gt; one of the
&gt; first men to experiment with the necessary electronic
&gt; receiving
&gt; equipment. The very same equipment, albeit more
&gt; sophisticated than Tesla
&gt; had access to, is being used today to receive EVP.
&gt; 
&gt; Many people experimenting with Electronic Voice Phenomena
&gt; (EVP) and
&gt; Instrumental Transcommunication (ITC) say they have
&gt; received messages
&gt; from &quot;the other side&quot; through radios, tape
&gt; recorders, VCRs, televisions,
&gt; telephones, and even computers.
&gt; 
&gt; These phenomena have manifest themselves since the
&gt; appearance of the
&gt; instruments themselves. EVP, for example, has been reported
&gt; for well
&gt; over 50 years or more: Strange voices being picked up with
&gt; primitive
&gt; radios during WWI and heard faintly on magnetic recording
&gt; tape.
&gt; 
&gt; Tesla may have been the first to receive these electronic
&gt; voices from
&gt; another plane of reality. As with other modes of
&gt; communications with
&gt; alleged discarnate entities, care must be taken not to be
&gt; swayed by the
&gt; stories often told by beings from the other side. Tesla may
&gt; have been
&gt; duped, so-to-speak, by voices that only pretended to be
&gt; creatures from
&gt; other planets.
&gt; 
&gt; This is nothing new to those who are familiar with the tall
&gt; tales told
&gt; to them by spirits who claim to be ascended masters,
&gt; Abraham Lincoln or
&gt; Ashtar of the Interplanetary Space Command. Spirits love to
&gt; tell lies to
&gt; anyone who will listen.
&gt; 
&gt; Those such as Tesla and Marconi who experimented with radio
&gt; early on
&gt; were the first to report anomalous sounds and voices
&gt; emanating from
&gt; their radio receivers. These early reports were looked upon
&gt; as mildly
&gt; interesting curiosities and quickly forgotten.
&gt; 
&gt; Theosophist Alice Bailey in 1936, transcribed these words
&gt; of her great
&gt; teacher, the Tibetan Master DK:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Within the next few years the fact of the eternity of
&gt; existence will
&gt; have advanced from the realm of questioning into the realm
&gt; of certainty.
&gt; Through the use of the radio by those who have passed over,
&gt; will
&gt; communication be set up and reduced to a true
&gt; science.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; It has been widely written that Edison and his assistant,
&gt; Dr. Miller
&gt; Hutchinson, were seriously at work building a machine to
&gt; achieve spirit
&gt; communication. Tesla wrote in his journals that Thomas
&gt; Edison had heard
&gt; from other engineers that Tesla had been receiving
&gt; mysterious voices and
&gt; sounds over radio frequencies that were not conducive for
&gt; the
&gt; broadcasting of the human voice.
&gt; 
&gt; Edison, who publicly mocked Tesla and his experiments,
&gt; privately
&gt; believed that Tesla had managed to find the correct
&gt; frequency to enable
&gt; communication with spirits of the dead. Edison was
&gt; determined to
&gt; discover Tesla&#x27;s secret, and be the first to get the
&gt; &quot;Spirit Phone&quot; on
&gt; the market.
