&gt;&gt; Twisting a prediction after the fact to fit circumstances is one of the
&gt;&gt; biggest mistakes (or biggest cop-outs, or biggest lies) a would-be
&gt;&gt; future-teller makes.  The predictions you were touting were for August 15,
&gt;&gt; and included end-of-the-world warning..  Trying to say these were correct,
&gt;&gt; but not REALLY for August 15, and not REALLY end-of-the-world stuff, seems
&gt;&gt; like a way to save face, or keep hoping the messages are real, when in fact,
&gt;&gt; this is another example that they are not.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So from now on, you will no longer hear clear dates and predictions.  You
&gt;&gt; may hear vague dates and vague predictions if you like, but you will not
&gt;&gt; hear anything that can be confirmed.  Doing so would put you in a position
&gt;&gt; of having to question the verity of the EVP data you collect.  And that
&gt;&gt; might lead to abandoning this while area of study.  And we know you cannot
&gt;&gt; do that.

&gt;&gt;  Well, it seems the original prediction of the east coast getting
&gt;&gt; clobbered is probably correct. Where I fell down was trying to ask questions
&gt;&gt; and getting BS doomsville junk. I knew it&#x27;s a mistake to ask questions, that
&gt;&gt; like opens the door for the dark dorks. I&#x27;m going back to just announcing
&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m doing an EVP recording, and just record. They know what I&#x27;m thinking and
&gt;&gt; what I need to know and who I would like to hear from. Asking questions, at
&gt;&gt; least for me, has always lead to problems. I&#x27;m not like others, presumming
&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m so smart and know what is talking, and if it&#x27;s honest, like most of the
&gt;&gt; box experts out there on the web. You know, the ones doing pod casts, radio
&gt;&gt; shows and proclaiming this that and the other thing.
