<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Dave; I can&#x27;t wait to listen to your files. Unfortunately I&#x27;ll have to wait until the evening when I&#x27;m at home again; here at work it&#x27;s not so good to listen to EVPs... :o

&gt; Stefan,
&gt;  I tried your idea last night using your file and instructions and got some
&gt; results. Most messages were two or maybe three words, only a couple were
&gt; longer with any meaning. I&#x27;ll post a few here as an example.
&gt; &quot;Ohh Yes&quot;
&gt; &quot;You hear the people&quot;
&gt; &quot;The people use the test, you should tape..error&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the excellent tip, this method appears to have great potential,
&gt; Dave

&gt; Hi Misty, &quot;inner energy&quot;, all,
&gt; 
&gt; maybe one could feed the SpeakJet allophones into EVPmaker. The attached
&gt; WAV file contains the 72 allophones of the SpeakJet chip. (I used
&gt; Audition to cut them out of the sample clip which has been posted here
&gt; recently, and store them in a cue list.) To use this file as an EVPmaker
&gt; source, the &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option must be checked. I have done a few short
&gt; sessions, and got this strange message:
&gt; 
&gt;                 &quot;I little Sir help you eclipse.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; (Doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me... lol)
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, this cannot replace a hardware version of SpeakJet, since
&gt; EVPmaker isn&#x27;t able to produce the proper transitions between the
&gt; allophones. But maybe it&#x27;s worth a try...
&gt; 
&gt; Stefan
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; -- 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I used the phrase &quot;the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&quot; in
&gt; Stefan&#x27;s evpmaker and have had interesting results including some live. I
&gt; tried other pangrams (contain every letter of english
&gt; &gt; alphabet) but the one I felt drawn to use was the one that has had the
&gt; best results.
&gt;    
&gt; &gt;   No two sessions are ever alike and as background sound its easily
&gt; modulated into quite complicated sentences and word structures.
&gt;

&gt; &gt;           You know, i was thinking:
&gt; &gt; If you could build a random event generator built on the spoken
&gt; &gt; letters of the alphabet,
&gt; &gt; that would definately be nice and very good.</pre>
