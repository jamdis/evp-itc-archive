I&#39;m not happy with\nhaving to hold down the button, or needing to reset.  I removed the\nbutton pcb from the top half of the case tonight (including what looks\nlike a secondary antenna, the metal disc?), and removed the dome\ncontact from the up scan contact.  Going to run to radio shack\ntomorrow and just solder a switch in to place on the trace contacts\n(i.e. the contacts on the pcb that get connected when you press in the\ndome piece).  Going to be putting everything in to its own project\nsetup anyways, so that&#39;s fine.\n\nMarty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristin Morris&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Marty - Yes it happens to me but I just use that time (silence)\nto repeat\n&gt; my question or start a new one. \n&gt; \n&gt; k\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of\n&gt; don powell\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 01, 2008 11:14 PM\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] 12-820 Random channel lock even when mute cut?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Actually I&#39;ve found that if I hold the tuning button down it will\n&gt; continually scan (I did clip the wire before I checked to see if\nthat would\n&gt; work without &quot;surgery&quot;)\n&gt; \n&gt; Don\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: wgungfu &lt;wgungfu3@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 1, 2008 9:48:54 PM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] 12-820 Random channel lock even when mute cut?\n&gt; \n&gt; I cut the mute cable on a 12-820 and had it cycle through. Every so\n&gt; often, it&#39;ll still lock on a random channel for like a second or so\n&gt; and then start the sweep again. On one of the FM sweeps it actually\n&gt; locked in on a &quot;not in tune&quot; channel permanently. Anyone else have\n&gt; this happen?\n&gt; \n&gt; Marty\n&gt;"}
