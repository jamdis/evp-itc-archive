I take the\n&gt; &gt; tuners out of the radio, and supply my own amplifier and sweep. At\n&gt; present\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m making a box using a Timex clock radio tuner, the triangle sweep, and\n&gt; &gt; computer sound amplifier and speaker system for the bass response. I just\n&gt; &gt; started this project yesterday. I use Timex model T309T AM/FM/nature\n&gt; sounds\n&gt; &gt; clock radios when I can find them in thrift stores cheap. I found a Timex\n&gt; &gt; model T313T this morning, and hoping it has the seperate tuner board\n&gt; inside,\n&gt; &gt; as the 300 series has so far.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I used to use car stereo tuner modules, but those tend to be too noisy.\n&gt; Box\n&gt; &gt; 13, that Hultay just got back is based on a car tuner.
