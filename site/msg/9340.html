<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rees.  What is said, and still maintain this opinion, is:  

My best (clearest, longest, most meaningful) responses have come via the manual radio 
sweep technique.  My next favorite is the MiniBox.  Third on my list of preferences is the 
hacked Radio Shack models.  This is not to say I do not like them, but I like them least.  

This also does not mean that I&#x27;m not open to experimenting with another model (I 
currently own both the old and new 469&#x27;s and the old 470&#x27;s, so I have based my opinion 
on experience and not just uninformed bias).

I would place EVP Maker with the allophones file ahead of the shack hacks as well, but I 
don&#x27;t consider that method to be among the &#x27;radio sweep&#x27; methods for comparison.

&gt;   I though you didn&#x27;t like RSGhost Boxes, I knew you would come around, kinda like 
when I said I would never buy a Mini Box, and now I&#x27;m in the market to buy one of those 
too.lol

&gt;           Oh noooooo, Kay and Jeff. I&#x27;m having a vision that making another purchase at 
Radio 
&gt; Shack is in my near future. ROFLOL. 
&gt; 
&gt; Looking forward to hearing some 820 examples once they start coming through for you.

&gt; &gt; The diffence between the 12-820 and new 12-469 is amazing. There is 
&gt; &gt; no clicking what so ever on either band. The Am band is so quiet I 
&gt; &gt; had to look at the radio to make sure it was still sweeping! I tried 
&gt; &gt; it out this morning for a bit but didnt get anything. I hope they 
&gt; &gt; like the new radio.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the update, Kay. I&#x27;ve also noticed varying sweep times 
&gt; &gt; between AM &amp; FM on other 
&gt; &gt; &gt; models. Not sure if the actual rate of sweep differs, for just 
&gt; &gt; the amount of channels there is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be swept on one band versus another, so it takes longer to 
&gt; &gt; complete one full cycle.
