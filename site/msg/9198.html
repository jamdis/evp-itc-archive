Hi Bruce that doesn't surprise me. It is just like when you are recording
w=
ith a cassette tape you are always letting the good in with the bad.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] An incident that may be a concern
=20
for all researchers,
=20
THIS IS NOT FOR THE REASON OF PUSHING A PANIC BUTTON OR A MATTER OF
GIVING IN TO FEAR.
=20
It is simply an incident that I feel researchers should be aware of
as a possibility. Given in my opinion the boxes do open a portal due
to the connection necessary for real time two way communication, and
the wide spread belief that entities can and do manipulate physical
objects when in the presence of them.
=20
I have just been made aware of a situation that has happened to a
fairly new researcher whom I believe to be honest and forthcoming.
=20
the incident involved the aftermath of a regular RS box session. The
researcher had finished his session with the practice of asking that
any entities that may have traveled through the box, return and asked
for conformation, then proceeded to end the session and turn the box
off. he was assured that he turned the box off by going back to the
recording after the incident and validating verbally that he did in
fact turn off the box.
=20
He left the room for a few moments , when he returned he allegedly
witnessed a white cloud move across the room and noticed that his RS
box was turned on and running.
=20
This is actually the first instance I have encountered where the
possibility of an entity that may have
=20
purposely stayed behind to turn the box back on and let other
entities through. matter of fact
=20
that concept has not occurred to me before. but now sounds very
possible.
=20
This may even happen at times we are never aware of and they actually
turn the box on and when
whatever comes through is through they turn it off again and we are
none the wiser.
=20
I will definitely address this in my sessions, what I suggest is
until we come to a mutual agreement among researchers
on this occurrence, I think it best that when we end a session we
remove at least one battery from the box to prevent it being turned
back on.
