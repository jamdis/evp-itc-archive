Welcome to the world of 12-470 (older version) ownership.  I \nthink you will find it a bit better than the 12-469, in my opinion \nanyway.  I guess since I own both models... I can say that after a \nside by side comparison.  You can say goodbye to that AM sweep \nclicking found on the 12-469, anyway.\n\nEnjoy your new experimental device... once it arrives!\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you.
