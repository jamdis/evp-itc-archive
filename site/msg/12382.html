drop on that one?

&gt; Short .469 session yesterday, I asked if they could tell me my name.
&gt; Response I got was &quot;your actual name?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I replied yes, my actual name and received &quot;Andy....Mike&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; My name is Andrew Michael, and the response was almost immediate. The
&gt; file I posted was compressed for space saving, but from my initial
&gt; question I shaved several seconds off between the &#x27;yes my actual name&#x27;
&gt; and the &#x27;andy...mike&#x27;. total clip time before compression was about 10
&gt; seconds. Still pretty new at this, so hearing my first and middle name
&gt; repeated back to me takes some getting used to, but very exciting. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Andy
