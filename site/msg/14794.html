I was only talking about remote PK phenomena as being very rare, not all PK=
 phenomena. Still, any type of paranormal phenomena is rare, so the case co=
uld be made that PK is rare.

  I don't wish to belabor =
this point too much further since it is not the focus of this forum. Howeve=
r this is so central to understanding phenomenology and PK does appear to b=
e a potential root cause of at least some EVP and ITC work, so one more com=
ment is in order.

  As part of my research I reanalyzed many previously re=
ported cases. I found a remarkable number where PK (including remote PK) wa=
s a quite plausible explanation. 

  Consider also that in my work this is =
highly replicable phenomena. Replicable phenomena is defined as having a la=
rger effect size than subtle less replicable phenomena. Many forms of mediu=
mship and related psi are correctly defined as small effect size phenomena =
and hence far less replicable. This leads to the requirement to conduct ext=
ensive testing simply to establish correct statistical outcomes.

  However=
 as replicability improves so too does effect size (boiling water being an =
excellent example of a large effect size phenomenon that is of course highy=
 replicable). As effect size and replicability increase the 'rarity' of phe=
nomena is no longer supported. Therefore I would contend, based on the abov=
e that indeed remote PK is in fact far more common than is commonly believe=
d and in fact this nicely explains not a small percentage but in fact a lar=
ge percentage of many anecdotally reported phenomena.
