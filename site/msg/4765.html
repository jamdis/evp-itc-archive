<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Had a pretty good session today, i&#x27;ve been pretty blocked with other 
boxes yet i seem to always get great results with the RS 12-470.  Some 
really good responses to my questions.  Hey babs, i think you should 
give the RS box a little time and maybe you will start to get stuff.  
Although i have a 12-469 also and it really sux compared to the 12-
470.  The constant pulsing noise in the 469 model just drives me crazy 
enough to not concentrate.  Try looking for an older style model of the 
12-470, that&#x27;s probably the best radio i own hands down.  Instant 
results always and consistently.  All my boxes work, but they are 
finicky sometimes.  No need to comment to my posted files guys, just 
listen and see if i&#x27;m on some sort of a right track with the 
communication.
