Everyone would put on headphones and they would play different low/high pitched frequency tones and if you could hear a sound you would raise your hand. I found it interesting not everyone could hear all the tones being played. But it is the same with this, many hear it but most who dont tend to be in the over 20 age bracket. There were some studies done as to why but you will have to google for those.\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- On Thu, 1/22/09, laurie@... &lt;laurie@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: laurie@... &lt;laurie@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Sociological question\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, January 22, 2009, 2:01 PM\n&gt; I think they really are - isn&#39;t there some tone or range\n&gt; of sound that only kids can hear and shopowners use it to\n&gt; keep teens from hanging out there?\n&gt; \n&gt; I saw a show about it but can&#39;t remember what it is\n&gt; called now or why they can hear it but most adults\n&gt; can&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; L.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: &quot;David Koenig&quot;\n&gt; &lt;floridajakeblues@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, January 22, 2009 1:50pm\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Sociological question\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think that the children may even be better at hearing the\n&gt; voices.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Jan 22, 2009 at 1:12 PM, Misty Dawn\n&gt; &lt;[mailto:bulletbabea@...] bulletbabea@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; RJ\n&gt; I think the answers will vary from individual to individual\n&gt; based on thier beliefs. As for me personally I grew up\n&gt; surrounded by unexplained events and my parents tried to\n&gt; ignore the things that they couldnt see because if you\n&gt; ignore it then it doesnt exist right? But there comes a time\n&gt; when the child grows up and forms thier own ideas and\n&gt; beliefs. Personally speaking once I reached adulthood there\n&gt; were many other people who experienced the same things I did\n&gt; in that house so I began to see that there was more to it\n&gt; than just a childs imagination.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most religions are based upon the idea that there is a\n&gt; higher power, that we all have spirits, and that there is\n&gt; something beyond this life. To say that someone is wrong for\n&gt; belief in ghosts I would have to say that billions of others\n&gt; are wrong for having belief at all. I dont think bad of a\n&gt; parent who takes their kids off to church every sunday nor\n&gt; do I think badly about a parent who spends some time doing\n&gt; ITC. Telling a child that there is more than what the eye\n&gt; can see, more than what the ears can hear, is giving them\n&gt; the basics for growing up with a mind thats open to\n&gt; possibility. What they do with that is up to them\n&gt; individually.\n&gt; \n&gt; I worry more about the kids who grow up with parents who\n&gt; are alchoholics, drug addicts, liars, thieves, abusers,\n&gt; etcetera.. than anyone. \n&gt; \n&gt; As for if the effect is positive or negative, I think that\n&gt; has to do with the intent or the approach taken by each\n&gt; individual whether it be ITC, religion, or life in general.\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 1/22/09, Rick &lt;[mailto:rasterer%40yahoo.com]\n&gt; rasterer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Rick &lt;[mailto:rasterer%40yahoo.com]\n&gt; rasterer@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Sociological question\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; To: [mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com]\n&gt; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, January 22, 2009, 10:57 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was wondering if anyone had an opinion on the impact\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; performing\n&gt; &gt; ITC experiments or sessions, when there are young\n&gt; children\n&gt; &gt; around. Do\n&gt; &gt; you think the children seeing their parents or others\n&gt; (in\n&gt; &gt; person, not\n&gt; &gt; on TV) engaging in this activity would have an effect\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; the children,\n&gt; &gt; and if so, do you think the effect would be positive,\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; negative?"}
