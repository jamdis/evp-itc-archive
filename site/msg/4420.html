<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree with Mike, it sounds like you have no power.  Batteries 
good?  Wire from batteries crimped or cut? ;) - LC

&gt; So dummy here couldn&#x27;t even follow Mike&#x27;s great video instructions 
with the RS12-469.  After driving two hours to Merida, Mexico and 
then back and putting down 600 pesos (about $55 dollars) it took me 
ten minutes to do everything UFO Geek laid out in his video for 
hacking the radio shack box.  Cut the right pin labeled mute.  Closed 
the box nicely.  Nothing.  Reopened the box...looked around...two 
times more...still nothing.   Not even a light or hum.  
&gt;    
&gt;   Until I figure the radio thing out, I am in the mean time getting 
nowhere (it seems) with the EVP Maker on my computer to generate EVP 
noise and using my hand recorder etc.   Wish I could try the radio 
sistem...any real geeks who can give technical suggestions would be 
greatly appreciated.  Or maybe I should just throw away my 469 and 
start over.   Dont think RS will take it back.     geek-wanna-be, Ron
