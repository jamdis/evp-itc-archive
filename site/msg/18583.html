>Here is a short file, where someone says, "Scamp, Scamp," then Scamp barks=
. "yap."  This little dog belonged to my grandma, when I was about 9 o=
r 10 years old, he was a Manchester Terrier, and lived with us for many yea=
rs, and this is his bark for sure.  I'd know that bark anywhere. =
 Sorry, that I can't make it any clearer, I need to get one of those better=
 ghost boxes I guess.  RJ, spirits are just like us, they are not=
 omnipresent like God,  probably why David doesn't want to play t=
he guessing game, he has better things to do over there, and has said, they=
 have thousands of people standing in this long line waiting to get into th=
e Heavens, and He can't just drop His job and go to your house to see what =
you have over there, He did tell me that first time what it was, and i sent=
 it to you, but it was too late.  It's hard for me to understand them =
sometimes, He was also right about that little boy, Syler being
 killed, an=
d where his body would be found, I don't know what they did about it though=
