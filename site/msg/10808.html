<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Crap, I forgot, this is still Steve and Bruce&#x27;s group, they are the 
real EVP experts, just ask, they&#x27;ll tell ya. I mean, geeze, Steve has 
what, six months experience?

 There is always these little clowns that want to show off to the 
world, and claim they are to only experts.


  I&#x27;ve had enough!

&gt; Sorry you found another reason to complain frank, but some people 
like 
&gt; to hear others research and what they are getting.  I know that 
shot as 
&gt; well as many of your other e-mails are directed at me because your 
an 
&gt; angry bitter person, you may have noticed that i do not say 
anything 
&gt; bad about you. Why would 2 wrongs make a right? I seem to post some 
&gt; stuff from all different methods, maybe one will click and move us 
to a 
&gt; better level of communication.  There are other things than the 
frank&#x27;s 
&gt; box, is that why your mad?

&gt; &gt;  Hummmm, and yet you think this group is somhow more honest and 
open? 
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; was just wondering why yet another attempt at production was 
&gt; seemingly 
&gt; &gt; derailed, by get this--group members!? Or was it an outside 
&gt; influance? 
&gt; &gt; I wonder if any of these groups is worth the trouble. I already 
keep 
&gt; &gt; the group e-mail off, cuz I don&#x27;t care about someone&#x27;s latest 
hundred 
&gt; &gt; recordings. It seems like just a bunch of showing off. &quot;I just 
posted 
&gt; &gt; the latest....blah-blah-blah-blah&quot; Who gives a crap? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Yeah, negative, maybe.
