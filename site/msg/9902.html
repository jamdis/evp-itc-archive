Thanks Steve   That's encouraging.  I was hoping a lot of editing is not needed to get what you, Bruce and others get.  I need to stick with it and have patience.  I have a lot of patience...I have a lot of patience...one more time...I have a lot of patience.  It will come.  Keep up the great work guy.  Ron

Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these files. 
After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that 
section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the message 
a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise that 
don't belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can't piece these 
files together to make something it's not, so i keep them in true 
form pretty much to the original.
