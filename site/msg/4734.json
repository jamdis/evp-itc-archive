Or...maybe I try to more \ndown to earth? I think I actually have a more simple mind, and \nconciousness. \n\n It might be the person, this morning while &quot;sitting&quot; in the bathroom \nI&#39;m seeing pig faces on the towels, and wondering where the hell am I \ngoing to see pigs on new years day!? So I go in the kitchen, and the \nwife has animal planet on and it&#39;s about some womans pet pigs! I get \nthe same effect in the voices, I often hear stuff I&#39;ll hear in the \nimediate future. Most of the time it seems it&#39;s trivial stuff. If I try \nto listen for those profound bits of truth I get whacko prophecy crap \nthat never happens, and lunatic space aliens. It&#39;s the fact of the \nvoices that keeps me working, not the information that I get through \nit.  \n\n Frank-S"}
