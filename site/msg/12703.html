<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes,  good idea about isolating it from the power.  I&#x27;ll try that... 
thanks.  &quot;Cooking with EVPs Part 2&quot; :-)

The Faraday cage mentioned in the book was referring to the Raudive 
diode method. He wanted to make sure to eliminate the possibility of 
RF being detected by his diode input.
It worked and he still received EVPs.

I just wanted to try it with the RSH knowing that it would eliminate 
the RF that makes the RSH work. Since we don&#x27;t know for sure what is 
the best way, all ways are interesting and fun to try.
Since the RSH is still sweeping each frequency, you never know what 
might be transmitted in that range, even though it&#x27;s not receiving my 
local stations... maybe something else is on a particular frequency.

&gt; Why didn&#x27;t I thought of that before?  Thank you very much Mike, 
that was very interesting.  Microwaves might also be a nice echo box 
for voices.  Though, I think the addition of a sine wave might be 
needed for optimum results, that and the cooperation of the spirit 
world to talk into a microwave.  As for the AM reception, maybe a 
more direct grounding could help prevent it, so could unpowering the 
oven entirely.  How about doing the same test, outside, on a lawn, 
with the power plug buried?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This is fun!
&gt; Thanks again Mike,
