I tried several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner through the AM band late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the dial moving at a constant rate of speed. This is not nearly as good as Frank&#39;s &#39;hands off&#39; random tuning method but it still produced some results. What impressed me most is that some of the voices sound the same, even though I tuned through several channels. This attached capture could be a technical message.\n&quot;Plug a million hertz&quot;   One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which is close the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.\nDave\r\n----__Part.20070319171947.694294FB\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg\r\nContent-Type: AUDIO/MPEG; name=&quot;031907plugamillionhertz.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;031907plugamillionhertz.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__Part.20070319171947.694294FB--"}
