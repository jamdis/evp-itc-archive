Do not let anyone here, especially someone that's been here the same ammount of time as you, intimidate you.
This group is supposed to be an open forum for discussion of research pertaining to  ITC and EVP communication.
 
So feel free to post your opinion and beliefs on any matter within the confinds of this group without the fear of being ostracised.
This is the EVP-ITC yahoo group. And that is all.
 
Bruce

          That's cool.  I was just offering a suggestion since I too seem to get swept up in all the emails and am afraid I might miss some outstanding information.

          Bruce, 
    My thoughts exactly.  Is there anyway we can move this group over to a better suited environment for categorizing?  I tend to think of being able to categorize these different emails in a place being much more managable in a bulletin board style forum.  Does anyone have access to one on their webhosted site that we could setup and and use?  
All the best,
Bryan

    hey guy's,

I posted a number of files yesterday from my last EVP maker 
allophones session. and received not one response.

I think this is due to the overwhelming amount of posts that are 
being written and files posted to this group.

The files that are posted, not just mine but all are important to the 
research and deserve to be heard and commented on by all.

My thoughts are that this group is not just a place to post research 
results and posts pertaining to the technical and aspect and 
advancement of this research, but has become a social forum in some 
ways where small insignificant posts are tending to push other posts 
and file announcements to the back pages of the message area.

Also members personal e-mail is getting so cluttered with posts every 
day that most do not have the time, patience or strength to review 
each one and I know when I open a post be it here or in my e-mail and 
the first couple of words have nothing or little to do with research 
or are repetitious of ten other posts. I simply hit the delete 
button and the post goes unread.

I know we all everyone, put a lot of time and work into our research 
and when it falls through the cracks without even being presented for 
comment, it gets disheartening.

Maybe we should start a group for social and casual discussion 
amongst members and have this one for hard research posts.
That way one does not conflict with the other.

I know I sound like sour grapes, but I'm sure I'm not the only one to 
feel this way.

And I know the comments will come that no one has time to read all 
the posts or respond to all the files. I know all of this.

There is more to be said and more idea's on how to make the whole 
issue more amicable for everyone.

I just want to get initial reaction first.

Bruce
