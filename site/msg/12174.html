<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Since my limited experiences have always been neutral or positive in
nature, I was wondering what exactly these darkhead entities were. The
information I have been able to glean off the internet so far has been
fragmented, and mentions of them have always seemed to be like an
afterthought. I was just curious if they are negative entities that
attach and make life miserable for the operator or if they are merely
spectral bullies that keep other entities from properly communicating
during a session. I have seen them mentioned in passing here and other
boards dedicated to itc/evp. 

thanks in advance,
Andy</pre>
