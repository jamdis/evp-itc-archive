A sweep may\n&gt; be\n&gt; good here at say setting #6 with 30 stations. But your sweep may be better\n&gt; at\n&gt; #8 with only 20 stations. Not to mention atmospheric conditions and whether\n&gt; you\n&gt; are inside or outside.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you think that would work well for you, just mark the spot with a dab of\n&gt; white out.

I actually tested it on a crime\n&gt; case.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think I am going to really like this radio, but still have much more\n&gt; testing to do before I start using it with my clients.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I sent Chris a note as I am still trying to figure out what the toggle\n&gt; switch on top is for.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Chris if you see this note, please tell me what that toggle switch is,\n&gt; and I have a suggestion for your next radio.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Steve Hultay you may need what I suggest too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The silver dial that controls the speed of the scan, if you can add a\n&gt; circle label underneath that displays 1/8 line increments in a circular\n&gt; pattern, so we can turn the dial to each increment. What this will allow the\n&gt; user to do is mark the line increment that works best for recording.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For me I need to be able to turn the device on and record for a client,\n&gt; and it will be hard for me to try and find that sweet spot every time I\n&gt; record.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am going to see if I can find or make a sticker to place under the\n&gt; dial.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Again, so far I love it!
