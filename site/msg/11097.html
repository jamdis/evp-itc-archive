you will also need to buy a good speaker to listen with the radio...  Cheap one don't work very well.  Radio Shack sell a ham radio speaker that works great.  It runs around $25.00 also.  Don't forget to buy a recorder or a miciphone for your cpu to record your seesions.  I think recording straight on the cpu is the best way to do it, but almost everybody is going to disagree with me on that subject.  Thats the way that I do it, and I didn't have to go out and buy a recorder for 100 bucks.

Hi Matt,

You can get a Radio Shack 12-469 for $25 and hack it to do the scanning.
