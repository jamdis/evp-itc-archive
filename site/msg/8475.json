I hacked the 20-125, its a little harder to hack, and most people in the form is going to recommend this radio, but I just didn&#39;t like it.  It has a long antenna and was hard to get reception.  \n   \n  The 12-469 doesn&#39;t have a antenna on the outside, and what you do is hold it in your hand.  Your body acts as the antenna, and that&#39;s how I got my best reception.  But this is my opinion, go with your gut feeling, if you get a radio you don&#39;t like just take it back to the shack.  Act like nothing is wrong with it, and try the other one.\n\npsfponies &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n            I am looking at getting either the 12-469 or 20-125.
