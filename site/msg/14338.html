  I like graveyards..thats the geneaolo=

 out the family relationships and the relationships of the names to local h=
istory...I haven't done much investigating in them, but I was once called t=
o investigate some activity at a cemetery - I was called by the caretaker.

  I have run boxes and held evp sessions in cmeteries, parks, my backyard,=
 places that are reputedly haunted, places that are not supposed to be haun=
ted and it seems to not matter - I have gotten evps and rtsc at all of the =
types of places - it doesnt seem to matter whether the  place is haunted or=
 not. I will say that the best and clearest communications I have in my col=
lection are from haunted locations -  Fort Mifflin and a haunted apartment =
building. 

  Now, if a place is "haunted" by a specific personality, the s=
pirit is already there in the place (theoretically), so  when you begin you=
r session (evp or itc) your chances of talking to that particular spirit sh=
ould be better, but this isn't always the case - the only thing I can say a=

here is some component missing from the equation that might give us, the op=

 tones.
