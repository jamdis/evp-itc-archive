Proving EVP would be fantastic.=A0 And it sounds as though several people h=
ere are confirming this message.

If you all could agree on some wording of=
 the prediction, I'd be happy to post it as far and wide as possible around=
 the internet for you.=A0 Plus, if you have some confidence in it, it would=
 be unethical not to post this - it could save lives.=A0 

Sure - if you're=
 wrong, that would be a bit awkward.=A0 But consider: post and be wrong, so=
me people get embarrassed.=A0 Don't post and be right: people could die who=
 might have been saved.

It seems unethical to keep silent.=A0 Given the po=
tential impact, how can you be silent?
