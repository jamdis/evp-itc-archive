Science is not just about the evidence, it=92s=\r\n about the entire process, including how the evidence is collected and how =\r\n(and by whom) it is interpreted.  This is why a valuable tool in the scient=\r\nific arsenal is the double (and triple) blind study.  It attempts to remove=\r\n the often uncontrollable subjectivity inherent in all people, even scienti=\r\nsts!  Science uses this technique to help keep even itself as honest as pos=\r\nsible.  So if you are finding that the evidence is being ignored, the reaso=\r\nn may not be the evidence itself (no matter how compelling). It may very we=\r\nll be the manner in which it is collected, and interpreted: all at least as=\r\n important as the audio itself.\n\n          EVP=92s are perfectly allowed to=\r\n throw monkey wrenches, and even kitchen sinks into scientific theories and=\r\n accepted dogmas: but only if they follow science=92s rules.  It=92s like t=\r\nrying to put a new medicine on the market with claims that it destroys acce=\r\npted dogmas: but, if the testing has not been rigorous and up to accepted m=\r\nedical standards, its hard to blame consumers for being doubtful of its cla=\r\nims.\n\n          Science is not magic: it is a simple process really, but it=\r\n forces a claim to really be solidly confirmed. It seems to me that, while =\r\nEVP research has its toe in the water of scientific methodology (it is maki=\r\nng observations, collecting evidence, and making theories), it seems to be =\r\nobsessed on that phase of science, and not on the hard part: designing and =\r\nconducting objective tests to conform or dismiss the theories.  It seems th=\r\nat so many people are having so much fun with their audio devices and resul=\r\nts, that they are maybe afraid of taking it to the next step of serious tes=\r\nting, maybe because of the risk this testing could destroy their fun.\n\n    =\r\n      But they should maybe consider it might NOT destroy their fun, but in=\r\nstead that next phase of testing may be just what the doctors ordered to br=\r\ning EVP into mainline science: real, science-based testing.  I fear the peo=\r\nple accepted as the real experts and pioneers in this field (like you Frank=\r\n) will never get any acknowledgement of their achievements unless they have=\r\n are able to move into this next phase.\n\n          Science wants you to pis=\r\ns on its fire, Frank.  But you have to go where the fire is.   And the way =\r\nthere is through the entire scientific method, not just the early fun parts=\r\n, but the hard testing parts.  But I understand how difficult that prospect=\r\n can be, and that it would take your focus off the part you seem to like be=\r\nst (experimenting with the equipment).  If you are unable to bring yourself=\r\n to the testing phase, it might be worth looking at partnering up with othe=\r\nrs who would focus on that part for you?  I think a very dynamic team of pe=\r\nople could be formed with you focused on the technology creation, and they =\r\nfocused on the more mundane aspects of rigorous blind study testing.  Do yo=\r\nu think that would be valuable to you, and to the field of EVP studies? \n\n =\r\n          \n\n\n          --- On Mon, 5/4/09, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@=\r\ngmail.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n            From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@gmail=\r\n.com&gt;\n\n            Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: People given a grant to do wh=\r\nat you all are doing,\n\n            To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n\n           =\r\n Date: Monday, May 4, 2009, 9:28 AM\n\n\n\n             It&#39;s not that it can&#39;t =\r\nbe proven, it&#39;s that all evidence is deemed unacceptable- -a convinient way=\r\n to make uncompfortable facts go away.

It seems \n          to me that, while EVP research has its toe in=\r\n the water of scientific \n          methodology (it is making observations,=\r\n collecting evidence, and \n          making theories), it seems to be obses=\r\nsed on that phase of science, \n          and not on the hard part: designin=\r\ng and conducting objective tests to \n          conform or dismiss the theor=\r\nies.&nbsp; It seems that so many people \n          are having so much fun w=\r\nith their audio devices and results, that they \n          are maybe afraid =\r\nof taking it to the next step of serious testing, \n          maybe because =\r\nof the risk this testing could destroy their \n          fun.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But the=\r\ny should maybe consider it might NOT destroy their \n          fun, but inst=\r\nead that next phase of testing may be just what the \n          doctors orde=\r\nred to bring EVP into mainline science: real, \n          science-based test=\r\ning.&nbsp; I fear the people accepted as the real \n          experts and pi=\r\noneers in this field (like you Frank) will never get any \n          acknowl=\r\nedgement of their achievements unless they have are able to \n          move=\r\n into this next phase.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Science wants you to piss on its \n          f=\r\nire, Frank.&nbsp; But you have to go where the fire is.&nbsp;&nbsp; \n      =\r\n    And the way there is through the entire scientific method, not just \n  =\r\n        the early fun parts, but the hard testing parts.&nbsp; But I \n     =\r\n     understand how difficult that prospect can be, and that it would take =\r\n\n          your focus off the part you seem to like best (experimenting wit=\r\nh the \n          equipment).&nbsp; If you are unable to bring yourself to t=\r\nhe testing \n          phase, it might be worth looking at partnering up wit=\r\nh others who \n          would focus on that part for you?&nbsp; I think a v=\r\nery dynamic team of \n          people could be formed with you focused on t=\r\nhe technology creation, \n          and they focused on the more mundane asp=\r\nects of rigorous blind study \n          testing.&nbsp; Do you think that wo=\r\nuld be valuable to you, and to the \n          field of EVP studies? \n      =\r\n    &lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Mon, 5/4/09, Frank \n   =\r\n       Sumption &lt;I&gt;&lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:purplealiengirl@...&quot; \n      =\r\n    target=3D_blank&gt;purplealiengirl@&lt;WBR&gt;gmail.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; \n       =\r\n   wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,2=\r\n55) 2px solid&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: Frank Sumption &lt;&lt;A=\r\n \n            href=3D&quot;mailto:purplealiengirl@...&quot; \n            target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;purplealiengirl@&lt;WBR&gt;gmail.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV=\r\n class=3Dim&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: People given a grant to do \n        =\r\n    what you all are doing,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;To: &lt;A hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot; \n            target=3D_blank&gt;EVP-ITC@=\r\nyahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Date: \n            Monday, May 4, 2009, 9=\r\n:28 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV class=\r\n=3Dim&gt;\n            &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;It&#39;s not that it can&#39;t be=\r\n proven, it&#39;s that all evidence \n            is deemed unacceptable- -a con=\r\nvinient way to make uncompfortable \n            facts go away.&nbsp; The fa=\r\nct is&nbsp; most of the EVP evidence \n            pretty much contradicts, =\r\nor at least throws a monkey wrench in many \n            so called scientifi=\r\nc theories, and accepted dogma.

The W=\r\nindbridge Institute received some of this sponsor \n                  money =\r\nfor what they called &quot;Real-time EVP Conversations: A \n                  Pil=\r\not Study.&quot; The method for this communication was *not* \n                  b=\r\nased on radio sweep, nor traditional methods, so it&#39;s not \n                =\r\n  based on what I assume many people here are doing. And in \n              =\r\n    fact, it *was* based on the creations of someone outside of \n          =\r\n        the USA, so I&#39;m a little confused as to why all the hostility \n    =\r\n              toward AAEVP for putting up the money.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sadly, radio \n =\r\n                 sweep methods don&#39;t, and may not for a long time, get the =\r\n\n                  respect of the scientific community that it deserves (th=\r\nen \n                  again, seems no form of EVP does), but at least this =\r\ncurrent \n                  research is a step in the right direction. I hop=\r\ne, when \n                  Windbridge concludes their study, that it will s=\r\nupport the \n                  notion that there is apparent communication f=\r\normed in ways \n                  that cannot be explained by currently know=\r\nn and understood \n                  laws of nature. THAT alone, in my opini=\r\non, would be a big plus \n                  for all ITC communities, regardl=\r\ness of the method from which \n                  that communication was rece=\r\nived. What&#39;s the old saying? &quot;It \n                  takes but one white cro=\r\nw to prove all crows are not black.&quot; \n                  Any proof, derived =\r\nfrom any EVP method, would be greatly \n                  welcomed as far as=\r\n I&#39;m concerned.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Margaret &lt;/P&gt;\n                  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In =\r\n&lt;A \n                  href=3D&quot;http://mc/compose?to=3DEVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&quot; \n                  rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups =\r\n.com&lt;/A&gt;, Frank \n                  Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ ...&gt; wr=\r\note:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                  It&#39;s the same old stuff, everyone w=\r\nants to completely ignore \n                  absolutely all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; work th=\r\nat has been in this field since \n                  the caveman and act like=\r\n they just&lt;BR&gt;&gt; discovered spirit \n                  and EVP.
