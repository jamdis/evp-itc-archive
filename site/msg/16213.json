I certainly do not claim to be a braniac or a know-it-=\r\nall, as you have called me in your post.\n\n                  In fact I am sa=\r\nying the opposite: I am saying that I do not know:  I am saying I do not kn=\r\now how anyone can believe these 2012 predictions when all they have is stor=\r\nies and questionable claims.  I don&#39;t know how they can believe this stuff =\r\nwhen they actually DO have evidence that all the similar claims in the past=\r\n have been shown to be false. I do not know why they believe this claim is =\r\nany more justified than all the others,\n\n                  I do not know ho=\r\nw the group can say on its home page &quot; It&#39;s one thing to be skeptical, it&#39;s=\r\n another to ignore and deny all evidence.&quot;, yet it is the people who are ce=\r\nrtain of the 2012 prophecies that seem to be ignoring and denying evidence =\r\nthat it is only one more in a long line of unsupported failed predictions, =\r\nnot those who are skeptical of it.\n\n                  I do not know how it =\r\njustifies you referring to me as  a &quot;wanne be brianiacs claiming to know al=\r\nl&quot;, when the group home page suggests such attacks get people banned.  I do=\r\n not know how being skeptical of a future prophecy makes one a know it all.=\r\n And I do not know how prompting people to judge for themselves makes me a =\r\nknow it all. \n\n                  And I don&#39;t know why the group home page s=\r\nays a good argument is ok, yet you start name-calling offended when someone=\r\n questions something you do not agree with, or proposes a theory alternate =\r\nto your own.\n\n                  So call me ignorant.  Obviously I really do=\r\nn&#39;t know very much at all.  \n\n                  But of the very few things =\r\nI do know, I now it is good to question, and not take everything, especiall=\r\ny prophecies, at face value.  And I know the best way to test a prophecy, a=\r\nnd the people making them, is to see if they actually come to pass.  And I =\r\nknow that since no evidence can support a prophecy&#39;s truth until it comes t=\r\no pass, and since all past end-of-world prophecies have no evidence of thei=\r\nr success, that those who think they know something special about why 2012 =\r\nis different, certainly know more than I.\n\n                  And so I hope =\r\nthey (or you, if you count yourself among them) will post your evidence, an=\r\nd your predictions, and your dates.  And we won&#39;t have to argue about it.  =\r\nWe can just put that person, and their predictions, and their dates, on our=\r\n calendars, and judge when the date comes, who was really acting as a know-=\r\nit-all.  \n\n                  One thing I think we can all agree on:  one kn=\r\nows it all.
