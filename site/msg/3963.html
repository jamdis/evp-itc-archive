<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Kristin,

I&#x27;m not an electronic engineer either. I&#x27;m more of a tech as far as 
ideas and an experimenter with functional tools. However, Ron 
Ricketts is an engineering wizard and a friend. He lives in the 
Dallas area. Would you like for me to give him a contact email for 
you?

Lance

&gt; Hi Lance.  I have family in the Dallas area and get there often.  
The kind
&gt; of help I am referring to is stuff like which tiny little spec on a 
board
&gt; goes to what wire?  Or how not to solder my fingers, etc.  
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to Bruce for mentioning the SKYPE.  Thanks to all whom 
really don&#x27;t
&gt; mind helping me begin my journey down this path.  You are all great.

&gt; I&#x27;m in North Texas, the college town of Denton.
&gt; 
&gt; There are many techs in the Dallas/Ft Worth area. 
&gt; 
&gt; What sort of assistance are you referring to precisely?

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m just wondering if there is someone close by to help me with 
the
&gt; &gt; tech stuff one day.
