First, as I said, I do not post the files I've made because they would be a=
 waste of time, since there is nothing paranormal about them.

Second, I no=
tice you just did the same thing again: post a story about some past claim,=
 which is just words, no substance. That's what everyone seems to do who sa=
ys they can get predictions. In fact, in your last prediction on this list,=
 you were very specific that you did not want to post it, and that you had =
given it to friends instead, who would verify its verity.=C2=A0 So, seems t=
o me you know there is nothing to these predictions.=C2=A0 If there were, y=
ou and everyone else would be posting them all over the internet, especiall=
y if they could save lives.=C2=A0 To not post them, when they could save li=
ves, would be pretty evil.

It's this kind of behavior that turns believers=
, even open minded people, into skeptics.

Actually, it's more interesting than that.=C2=
