Seems Yahoo isn't letting anyone play the files that we post, so i've  
attached them to this e-mail.
 
Files:
 
"Bless You"---That's what i heard and was pretty funny and polite for them  
to say that.
 
"It's For Steve"---No question was asked before this message
 
"Lisa"---"Yeah"---"Maybe it's supposed to be hard"---This ones a little  
rough, but i hear it
 
"Punk"---"Blake"-"Blake"---"His Face"------Blake is a guy i work with who  is 
helping me develop some new stuff, it's funny that they mentioned him.   
Blake is not a common name to be mentioned on the radio either.
 
"Purple"---"Marcus"---"Chris"---"Chris"---"Beavis Hicks"----I screwed up  
most of the names in real time, but i'm only human.  The upside is that the  
files are getting longer, meaning better conversations.  Maybe frank knows  a 
beavis hicks.
 
"You car's still running"---I did this 5 minute session while getting ready  
for work this morning and my car was outside running to warm up.  I guess  
they picked up on that.  This file is a little rough as well.
 
_____________
 
 
I also included the two from Frank's video that were very clear  messages.
 
"Where's Purple" and "We're friggin' People"
 
 
Hope you can make out some of these,
 
-Steve H.
 
 
p.s. Hang tight for the second set of files.  I have one nerve left  and 
Yahoo is jumping on it like a trampoline.  I can only send a couple at  a time.
