<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is fascinating.  I have every work that Tesla published in my 
library, including a collection of all his patents.  I&#x27;ve studied all of 
it thoroughly. I knew that there was a collection of unpublished works 
which the US government confiscated after he died.  A certain group was 
offered this entire collection of unpublished works back in the 50&#x27;s but 
declined to take them.  So I wondered what happened to them - if they had 
been destroyed or if they were stored.

I&#x27;d like to get my hands on some of that material!

Tesla once worked for Edison but there was personal friction between the 
two and they parted ways. It was after that that Tesla developed 
alternating-current systems and Edison still had his money invested in 
direct-current power distribution.  When Tesla&#x27;s AC systems gained favor, 
it did not make Edison happy.

Mark Twain became a very close friend of Tesla.  I have some photos taken 
in Tesla&#x27;s New York lab where Clemens (Twain) is standing with a ball of 
lightning between his hands.

It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me that Tesla had received some EVP. His equipment 
was rather crude by today&#x27;s standards and not very sensitive but I could 
envision it happening.

Mike, which Tesla lab do you live near, New York, Wardenclyffe or 
Colorado Springs?

&gt; Greetings fellow researchers,
&gt;
&gt; While listening to the Coast to Coast AM radio show last night I heard
&gt; something that was very interesting and surprising. The guest during the
&gt; hours I listened was Tim Swartz, and he was talking about the &#x27;lost
&gt; journals&#x27; of Nikola Tesla.
&gt; During the conversation Swartz mentioned that Tesla, while living in
&gt; Colorado Springs, had radio reception equipment on which he received
&gt; signals he did not believe were terrestrial. Some of those signals even
&gt; contained speech, in english. Tim Swartz made a comment during the show
&gt; that associated Nikola Tesla with EVPs. Awesome!
&gt;
&gt; Now... we all have heard that that Thomas Edison was the guy who was
&gt; thought to have been the one with an association with what may have been
&gt; EVPs and an actual device for contacting them, but could it be that
&gt; Nikola Tesla is the guy who really should be given the credit for that?
&gt; Do these &#x27;lost journals&#x27;, now found, have details or data which provide
&gt; documented proof that Tesla may have been communicating... or at least
&gt; listening to communication from beyond.
&gt;
&gt; If it wasn&#x27;t terrestrial in his opinion, I would imagine he considered
&gt; them to be extra terrestrial or possibly inner terrestrial.
&gt;
&gt; What is really cool from my vantage point... I live only three minutes
&gt; from where Nikola Tesla would have done those experiments and made that
&gt; communication contact. His lab was located on a hill within a 3 minute
&gt; drive; a place I have visited numerous times and attempted to capture
&gt; EVP at.
&gt;
&gt; It was when I first started my interest/investigation in EVP that I went
&gt; to where the Tesla lab was, and using a simple device I constructed,
&gt; tried my luck at EVP capture.
&gt; Now that I have a number of other devices to use, and now that I know
&gt; that Tesla may have been the pioneer in EVP discovery, I will probably
&gt; go back there with my devices and make some additional attempts.   Cool
&gt; stuff...!!!
&gt; Here&#x27;s a short excerpt from the Swartz book regarding Tesla and the
&gt; EVPs:
&gt;
&gt; Chapter 5 - Tesla and Electronic Voice Phenomena
&gt;
&gt; No one can deny that computers and electronics have forever changed our
&gt; way of life. There are electronic controls and computer chips in
&gt; everything from the small appliances that toast our bread to the cars we
&gt; drive, and make possible myriad forms of new entertainment, from VCRs
&gt; and DVDs to video games and talking stuffed toys.
&gt;
&gt; For a number of years some people have claimed that electronics can be
&gt; useful in a quite unexpected way: to contact the dead, or at least allow
&gt; the dead to contact us. Obviously, these claims are highly
&gt; controversial. They make many assumptions: that there is life after
&gt; death, that the dead are interested in contacting us, and that they have
&gt; the means by which to do so.
&gt;
&gt; The mysterious signals that Tesla received could be linked to what is
&gt; now known as Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP). Tesla was one of the
&gt; first men to experiment with the necessary electronic receiving
&gt; equipment. The very same equipment, albeit more sophisticated than Tesla
&gt; had access to, is being used today to receive EVP.
&gt;
&gt; Many people experimenting with Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) and
&gt; Instrumental Transcommunication (ITC) say they have received messages
&gt; from &quot;the other side&quot; through radios, tape recorders, VCRs, televisions,
&gt; telephones, and even computers.
&gt;
&gt; These phenomena have manifest themselves since the appearance of the
&gt; instruments themselves. EVP, for example, has been reported for well
&gt; over 50 years or more: Strange voices being picked up with primitive
&gt; radios during WWI and heard faintly on magnetic recording tape.
&gt;
&gt; Tesla may have been the first to receive these electronic voices from
&gt; another plane of reality. As with other modes of communications with
&gt; alleged discarnate entities, care must be taken not to be swayed by the
&gt; stories often told by beings from the other side. Tesla may have been
&gt; duped, so-to-speak, by voices that only pretended to be creatures from
&gt; other planets.
&gt;
&gt; This is nothing new to those who are familiar with the tall tales told
&gt; to them by spirits who claim to be ascended masters, Abraham Lincoln or
&gt; Ashtar of the Interplanetary Space Command. Spirits love to tell lies to
&gt; anyone who will listen.
&gt;
&gt; Those such as Tesla and Marconi who experimented with radio early on
&gt; were the first to report anomalous sounds and voices emanating from
&gt; their radio receivers. These early reports were looked upon as mildly
&gt; interesting curiosities and quickly forgotten.
&gt;
&gt; Theosophist Alice Bailey in 1936, transcribed these words of her great
&gt; teacher, the Tibetan Master DK:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Within the next few years the fact of the eternity of existence will
&gt; have advanced from the realm of questioning into the realm of certainty.
&gt; Through the use of the radio by those who have passed over, will
&gt; communication be set up and reduced to a true science.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; It has been widely written that Edison and his assistant, Dr. Miller
&gt; Hutchinson, were seriously at work building a machine to achieve spirit
&gt; communication. Tesla wrote in his journals that Thomas Edison had heard
&gt; from other engineers that Tesla had been receiving mysterious voices and
&gt; sounds over radio frequencies that were not conducive for the
&gt; broadcasting of the human voice.
&gt;
&gt; Edison, who publicly mocked Tesla and his experiments, privately
&gt; believed that Tesla had managed to find the correct frequency to enable
&gt; communication with spirits of the dead. Edison was determined to
&gt; discover Tesla&#x27;s secret, and be the first to get the &quot;Spirit Phone&quot; on
&gt; the market.
