<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Richard you might be crazy (sorry I dont know you enough to answer that LOL ask your friends for the answer to that one) but it has little to do with the matrixing around you that you see. Your brain is recognizing patterns around you, it just shows you are more aware of them now than you were before. 

When you get an image of someone that you recognize and that others recognize it really starts to make you think about it from a different perspective. Crazy is the least of my worries =)

Just be glad your eyes work and that your brain works allowing you to see patterns and distinguish faces. Some are not so blessed. I saw a couple on a talk show not long ago who can see and are otherwise healthy but thier brains malfunction and they are unable to fully see/matrix a persons face so they have to rely on thier sense of hearing in order to recognize thier own family or friends.

&gt; Years ago I noticed that some formations on walls and the
&gt; like looked
&gt; a lot like faces in the wood, concrete or paint or
&gt; whatever. Now i&#x27;ve
&gt; been looking around in my house at the walls and the like
&gt; and I see
&gt; hundreds of faces like you see in ITC. In the on-line game
&gt; I play I
&gt; stopped to observe some of the walls and the like in the
&gt; game and
&gt; there they are mixed in with the wall, almost like they
&gt; make up the wall.
&gt; 
&gt; In the wall paper of my win xp desktop landscape I see them
&gt; as well.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else notices this sort of thing
&gt; or if im just
&gt; out of my mind:)
