If you or any of \nthe other original people who put me on the correct path, ever have \nany questions or need any help please let me know. I would be honored.\n\nOh yes I almost forgot, I know you have never done box research and \ndo not own one. If you ever decide to give it a try I think I have an \nold 12-469 I&#39;m not using, your more than welcome to it.\n\nAnd all the help you need to get started. I would be glad to return \nthe favor.\n\n\nyour friend\nBruce"}
