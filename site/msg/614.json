What a cutie!\n&gt;\n&gt;   Is that working better now?\n&gt;\n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Hi All;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m having instability problems that I think is caused by batteries, so I\n&gt;went to Batteries Plus yesterday and got the smallest 12 volt gel cells \n&gt;they\n&gt;had. I didn&#39;t want to charge the batteries connected a plus and minus\n&gt;supply, the plus side draws more current with the audio functions, so needs\n&gt;more charge current. I also didn&#39;t have the chips on hand to make a plus \n&gt;and\n&gt;minus adjustable supply for the charger. I came up with the switch shown to\n&gt;seperate the batteries for charging, or connect them in a plus and minus\n&gt;supply configuration to run the boards.\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________________\n&gt;From photos to predictions, The MSN Entertainment Guide to Golden Globes \n&gt;has\n&gt;it all. http://tv.msn.com/tv/globes2007/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  __________________________________________________\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;Tired of spam?
