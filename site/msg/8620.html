Hi All;
 
 I was up at the Stanley, and many had the RS '469's, and the ma=
jor complaint is that chuffing sound. I bought one of the RS radios today, =
and found I can leave the mute pin intact, and instead cut the VT line, tun=
ing the radio with an external tuning voltage. The only(minor) problem is t=
hat the VT signal for this radio goes from -(minus) 3 volts for the bottom =
of the band, AM, or FM, to + 3 volts for the top of the band. A triangle wa=
ve generator is very cable of doing this, and you don't need to level shift=
 it like I do for my other boxes. You can also get low voltage ops, or run =
the op amps for the trianlge generator on a couple 9 volt batteries. I thin=
k what I would do is make the tuning adapter board, add an audio amplifier,=
 and mount the radio in a box with the front exposed. 
 
 I like the sound =
quality of the RS sahck radios, so it's worth doing for quick, and compact =
"box".
