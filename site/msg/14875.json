I went on to research every =\r\nevp pioneer i could, listen to hours/days of recordings and it changed my o=\r\nutlook on life. tears were turned to smiles and then I realised what all th=\r\nis research is for. it was a big step for me spiritually. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I dont know if there is anyone else on here using old fashione=\r\nd methods but if anybody would like to hear recordings please ask. I am usi=\r\nng a reel to reel sony &quot;Hi frequency&quot; recorder and trying various types of =\r\ntones, backgrounds e.t.c.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Good luck to everyon=\r\ne with their research, you are right we are changing history we are discove=\r\nring new things. if it wasnt for individuals such as raudive, jurghenson to=\r\n name a few, maybe we wouldnt have discovered this. it takes a brave indivi=\r\ndual to tackle an arrogant human race blunted with science.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Kind Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The quiet one :-)&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman,=\r\n new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; BORDER-LEFT: #=\r\n1010ff 2px solid; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DTahoma size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGH=\r\nT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &quot;SnowfireL@aol. com&quot; &lt;SnowfireL@aol. com&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; RTSC@yahoogroup=\r\ns. com; inside_the_box_ rtsc_talk_ radio@yahoogroup &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://s.com=\r\n/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;s.com&lt;/A&gt;; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com \n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B=\r\n&gt; Thursday, 4 June, 2009 20:25:26&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;S=\r\nubject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [EVP-ITC] Re: [RTSC] a copy of my final e-mail to Frank =\r\nsumption I will go no further!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff&gt;Sorry to hear this Bruce, I&nbsp;sure hope things ge=\r\nt better, &nbsp;I had no idea there were so many problems when I joined all=\r\n these lists, &nbsp;I think you are all great people, you folks together ar=\r\ne making history don&#39;t you all realize this?&nbsp; There are so many people=\r\n out there that have never heard of this type of communication, thousands o=\r\nut there!&nbsp; My friend just lost her mother a couple of weeks ago, when =\r\nI told her about the work you all are doing, tears were replaced with a smi=\r\nle, she is looking forward to hearing from her mom now too.&nbsp; Stop tryi=\r\nng to hurt each other, it&#39;s not worth it, life is too short for this stuff.=\r\n&nbsp; You are all great people, May God Bless You All&nbsp;~ And He Alread=\r\ny Has,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff&gt;sf&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nSTRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In a message dated 6/4/2009 2:27=\r\n:06 P.M.

I have made the same challenge to your friend moo=\r\nn who we all know is behind this tirade he has time and again refused\n or i=\r\ngnored the request for any type of audio file&lt;BR&gt;to be publicly posted for =\r\nrevue and continues to take advantage of innocent unsuspecting people with =\r\nhis con game and charging large amounts of money for sessions where he fabr=\r\nicates and makes up content as he goes along.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was the only one to =\r\nconfront him in public and expose him for the fake he is and this is his fe=\r\neble attempt at retaliation. I and other researchers like me have brought t=\r\nhis research light years from where it was when you and I first met, moon j=\r\nust continues to use it to rip people off and has not contributed a thing t=\r\no the research of ghost box communication beside lining his own pockets. &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just the fact that he has you doing his dirty work shows the type of =\r\nguy he is. I can remember a time when you publicly came out against any typ=\r\ne of money making using your boxes and even refused moon when he wanted to =\r\nmanufacture and sell them for large profits yet now you condone\n his robber=\r\ny of innocent unaware people and actually act foolish on his behest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Frank you are better than this, just concentrate on developing a better bo=\r\nx and forget about moon and his tricks and lies, he is finished in the para=\r\nnormal and he knows it, everyone is wise to his game and he is practically =\r\nan outcast.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Frank you are hitching you wagon to a dead horse. Get aw=\r\nay from these bad influences before they ruin your reputation as well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;We have had this moon discussion in the past and once he has exhausted h=\r\nis need for you he will screw you again like he has done so many times befo=\r\nre.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Frank, I like and respect you and I hope you will consider what =\r\nI have said in this e-mail and I sincerely hope you post this one on the ev=\r\np-itc group. I will be posting it on my group and others I belong to.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Your former friend&lt;BR&gt;Bruce&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: whit=\r\ne&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial, san-serif; COLOR: black&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HR&gt;\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://pr.a=\r\ntwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1221354145x1201369495/aol?redir=3Dhttp:%2F%2Fa=\r\nd.doubleclick.net%2Fclk%3B215221161%3B37268813%3By&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow&gt;Limited Time Offers: Save big on popular laptops at Dell&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLO=\r\nCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dh5&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-760317299-1244218643=:40209--"}
