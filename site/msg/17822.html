<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I guess the thread is crossed.  I wasn&#x27;t talking about your files, but your comment about Frank&#x27;s files.

&gt; I have no label on it, that is why i put the word &quot;clandsestine&quot; because I  
&gt; want to see what other&#x27;s hear if anything, this is not from a radio.sf

&gt; I generally don&#x27;t like to listen to files that someone has already told me  
&gt; what to listen for (or has labeled the file), since that influences what 
&gt; you  hear. In this case, it sounds like quickly turning the AM dial up and 
&gt; down the  dial, getting little snippets of broadcasts. So it does not sound 
&gt; interesting  to me beyond that.

&gt; &gt; That could be explained by you becoming practiced at hearing  what you 
&gt; want 
&gt; &gt; to hear in noise, regardless of the source of the  noise.

&gt; &gt; You know, I am  hearing some of the same voices on here, that I have 
&gt; &gt; received, the  same fella says the word, &quot;mercy.&quot; or is asking someone 
&gt; else for
