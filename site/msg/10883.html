Charm,
   
  You still recording with the water in the background? Many seem to enjoy using water to form the voice and your setup is close to my h2o background noise. I tend to test alot of methods, some they approve of some they complain about but with water they never complain about the method. 
   
  I noticed a big difference between your files and mine tho, most of my voices stick to that supersonic speed level so ya have to slow it down -74 to hear them normal speed but most of yours are contained in normal rate of speed playback. I find it all interesting =)

            Hi Kristin!
  thanks for your reply about my evp uploads...
  I am capturing these files on my hand-held Sony digital IC recorder. it has an internal mic and i download my files into digital voice editor, then audacity to cut them down, then put them thru clear voice denoiser to remove background noise ( what a gem of a program that is!)
  I have been catching these evps in my home, and am not sure really 'who ' peter and monique are ( as i have never known anyone by these names) but when i spoke to them today they had quite a bit to say, among which was that they have been with me 17 years. I asked them if they were a''couple' and monique said 'yes we are'and peter said 'no we're not' so i guess they are having a bit of fun with me.  ;)
  Im not sure what you mean by a hack, ( i do know what you mean by 'box'--like franks box or a spiricom- which no- i use neither of these things) however a good friend of mine is coming over tongiht and i plan to try and fandangle him into building me a spiricom device...... *crossing fingers* lol! 
  I have been doing evps about 3 years now and just the other day i found several that Peter and Monique identify themselves by name- and they were with me when i lived in a different house 3 years ago... so when I heard them again on my recorder recently- i thought i would try and see just how much info they can share with me.. I have gotten LOTS of evps from other ppl in this house i am in now as well. The vast majority are kind- but there is someone who is either a low-level entity or isnt very evolved who leaves me the odd nasty statement....
  Every house i have lived in has been very 'active ' so I finally decided to try and find out more abou them.
  Have you been doing evps very long? do you have a haunt in your house? I will have to look and see what files you have in the group ( ive listened to almost all of them but forget whos is whos now lol)
  what brought you into the field of paranormal research?
  anyway, thanks again and look forward to chatting again soon
  cheers   :)

          Hi Charm!
  
  I�ve been listening to your files and they are very intriguing.  Are these standard EVPs from an intelligent haunt of your own house?  Are you utilizing a hack or any other type of box to capture these?  
  Kristin
