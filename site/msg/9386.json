I just posed a pic\nof it under deadscience in the photos section.  I am giving this one\nto Regan and Vinny of APART.  They are both so dedicated to research\nthat I am certain we will get much for the group.  I took box # 1 into\nthe Seattle Underground and got some great 2 way real time\nconversations.  I will be doing an entire show on these boxes and the\nUnderground investigation this weekend.\nRob."}
