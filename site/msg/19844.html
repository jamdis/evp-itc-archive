<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Dear Frank, 
I didn&#x27;t mean any offense and I&#x27;m not looking for a neat package, don&#x27;t play video games, study sustainable planet options and environmental policy and don&#x27;t want the Ghost Hunters experience again where I validated for myself that these entities exist but still don&#x27;t know what/where they are.

After looking at your files a few times I had an &quot;aha&quot;moment. This is why I&#x27;m interested in this group.  Thank you for making the effort to share those files. I apologize if I came off like an ignorant jerk.  I realize I&#x27;m a &quot;newbie&quot; without the years of experience and work that the rest of you have put into this and I have nothing to teach you.  I&#x27;m here to learn.

-Adrienne

&gt;  It not just you, everyone wants everything handed to them, no thinking, no
&gt; work. They just want an excuse not to question anything so they can go on
&gt; playing video games, watching movies and ignoring how bad the world really
&gt; is.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  There is not even any discussion possible, not here, not on FB, not
&gt; anywhere. Everyone wants the same precanned BS from what they invision as
&gt; authorities. Just make it all go away so y&#x27;all can completely ignore all
&gt; reality. Ya don&#x27;t have to question, ya don&#x27;t have think, ya don&#x27;t have to
&gt; seek any answers.  I&#x27;m done.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m thinking there is faces embedded in sound, it&#x27;s related to speech,
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; not just EVP. It seems to be a normal function of our own minds(living or
&gt; &gt; &gt; dead), the same as reverse speech. I found some faces in old EVPs from
&gt; &gt; boxes
&gt; &gt; &gt; and also in music files. The ones from Evanescence are pretty impressive
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; person, and do not seem to be intentionaly embedded.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I know, it&#x27;s not ghost hunters, and most don&#x27;t want to have to think.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think most want this stuff in a neat little box, all well defined, all
&gt; &gt; &gt; rules and protocols known, but it just won&#x27;t stay in one box, or universe
&gt; &gt; &gt; for that matter.

&gt; &gt; Dear Frank,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think that I see what you mean. I mean no offense, but I it would be
&gt; &gt; helpful to see something a little more definitive that couldn&#x27;t be mistaken
&gt; &gt; for matrixing. Is this possible? Is it just me?
