Auto gain circuit 
While listening to the recording, you should note if=
 the background noise appears to fade drastically when a real, loud sound i=
s picked up. This means that your recorder probably has an auto-gain circui=
t (AGC) whose job is to keep sound levels roughly constant. Most voice reco=
rders have AGC and it usually can't be switched off. 
The problem is that t=
he AGC turns to high gain during quiet periods(amplifying background noise)=
 and low during noisy ones (when the background apparently fades away). Thi=
s can make it difficult to judge the relative loudness of different sound s=
ources from the recording. It also tends to exaggerate background noise whi=
ch can produce false APSs. In addition, the AGC affects the very part of th=
e recorder (the microphone input and lead which can act as an antenna) that=
 is most susceptible to radio interference. 
In addition, the AGC can give =
normal recordings a 'weird' feel. The unnatural way in which the background=
 sound can vanish and re-appear around normal sounds can feel quite spooky.=
 Sadly, it's just normal operation for the AGC which is designed primarily =
for 'average' applications where there are not usually long silent periods.=
 
Perhaps the only good thing about the AGC is that, if it reacts to a soun=
d, it means the sound is real and fairly loud which is useful information t=
o have. 
Some people deliberately ask questions out loud to sound recorders=
 to elicit EVP. They leave a silent gap for the answer before posing the ne=
xt question. If the recorder has AGC, it will tend to amplify the bits betw=
een the questions so that noise will be more prominent during the 'answer' =
section. 
Automatic gain circuits are common both in voice recorders and vi=
deo cameras. If you can get hold of a recorder with manual controls, so tha=
t you can override AGC, it would certainly make life easier. Such equipment=
 is, however, likely to be rare and expensive."
 
 That's why I took the AG=
C (audio limiter) out ofthe boxes.
