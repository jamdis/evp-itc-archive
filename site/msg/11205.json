That would be nice to switch SD cards from time to time. \nEspecially if one had a great EVP. \n&lt;rest snipped&gt;\n\nThought I&#39;d jump in here...\n\nFirst of all - I use mainly full spectrum sound recorders rather than \nthe standard hand-held digital voice recorders. Two reasons: 1. There \nare paranormal NON-VOICE sounds out there that are not being picked \nup by the limited response of the voice-only recorders, 2. The higher \nfrequencies in the 20-20 kHz human sound range contribute to the \nintelligibility of consonants. Using recorders with a higher \nfrequency response makes for clearer understanding of voices - \nparticularly those that are &quot;whispered&quot;.\n\nMy first foray into using full spectrum recorders led me to buy the \n(now discontinued) Fostex MR-8.\n\nhttp://namm.harmony-central.com/WNAMM03/Content/Fostex/PR/MR-8.html\n\nWhile it is not extremely portable nor hand-held, it is &quot;luggable&quot; \nand is perfect for stationary recording. It is full spectrum, battery-\npowered, uses Compact Flash and has inputs for multiple external \nmicrophones. [The later models use hard drives for storage making \nthem less rugged for field use, IMHO, and require AC power making \nthem less flexible as to location.] You can find used units in good \ncondition and relatively cheap on ebay. (Oh - and you can use either \nUSB download or read directly off the CF for storage/analysis.) Plus \nthe multiple inputs allow you to record infrsound and ultrasound on \nseparate channels in synch with the human audible sound range.\n\nFor over a year now - I&#39;ve used the Zoom H4.\n\nhttp://www.samsontech.com/products/productpage.cfm?\nprodID=1901&brandID=4\n\nhttp://www.zzounds.com/item--ZOMH4\n\nAgain...full spectrum, battery-operated, hand-held, uses SD storage. \nUSB interface. The built-in stereo mikes are amazingly sensitive but \nthe unit also has inputs for external mikes along with phantom power. \nI use it with a pair of noise-cancelling headphones and have \ndefinitly heard EVPs in real-time.\n\nZoom also has a newer model - the H2. Just as good.\n\nhttp://www.samsontech.com/products/productpage.cfm?\nprodID=1916&brandID=4\n\nhttp://www.zzounds.com/item--ZOMH2\n\nThe only complaint I have about the H4 is that it doesn&#39;t have a \nlanyard (I&#39;d hate to drop it) nor does it come with a carrying case \n(I bought a new case for a Fluke multimeter at an electronics supply \nshop which does the trick).\n\nHope this helps.\n\nGuy Jackson\nHuntington Beach, CA\n\nMember, AAEVP\nMember, Rhine Research Center\nMember, editorial board, Journal of Paranormal Research"}
