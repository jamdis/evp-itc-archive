The church was built in 1825 and still active.  \nI just knew there was something going on over at it, so I walked over \nand sat at the steps.  \n\nWhat I didn&#39;t post was that we did spirit rescue there, as we were \nable to hear some of the communication &quot;live.&quot;  The &quot;help&quot; messages \nseem to go crazy in the active spots, so I feel I have to try and \nassist if possible.  Hope I am doing good for them...\n\nBy the way, I gave an old 12-470 to a couple who have been working \nwith me out in the field.  They called me to tell me when they turned \nit on they heard my nickname (Chuck) multiple times and then the \nphrase, &quot;Thanks, Chuck.&quot;  LOL  I hope the spirits don&#39;t think I \nabandoned them!  :)\n\nLC\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristin Morris&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; LC - excellent files.
