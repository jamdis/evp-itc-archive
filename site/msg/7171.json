I will ask our group leader if we have \nroom for anyone else and let you know. We have like 12 or 13 in our \ninvestigation right now we want to keep it small but we can make room \nfor one more I think, it&#39;s not up to me though. I would be glad to \nhave you come along with us so I&#39;ll let you know. There is a small \nfee of $10.00  a person that goes for a tip to our guide that will be\nwatching us for those six hours 6:00pm to 12:00 midnite. Also any \nevidence we get must be turned over to the Manager of the Jenny Wade \nhouse afterward when we do the reveal. A copy of the evidence that is.\nIt&#39;ll be a good one I hope. Take care I&#39;ll get back to you soon okay.\n\nRegards,\n\nRalph L.

I get a ton of\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Tradional EVPs it seems everywhere I go. My group S.P.I.R.I.T.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Paranormal Investigation Team of central PA will be doing an\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; investigation at the Jenny Wade House in Gettysburg,PA. March 7th\n&gt; \n&gt; I\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; can&#39;t wait for that one.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Is this a Friday night investigation? Are you open to guests? I \nlive  \n&gt; 40 minutes away.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt;"}
