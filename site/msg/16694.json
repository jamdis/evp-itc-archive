This group shares\n&gt; information freely with the world. As for Karen she made a little appearance\n&gt; on a show on PTN yesterday and when I realized who their guest was I\n&gt; referenced my previous note to her about her research tactics or lack\n&gt; thereof. Someone else (her boyfriend) asked her if she is such a good\n&gt; researcher why couldnt she find waverly and she said &quot;is that question from\n&gt; some bitch named Misty&quot;. LOL no it wasn&#39;t Karen actually you have your\n&gt; boyfriend to thank for that one because he is the one who outed you and\n&gt; trashed you on air for all to see and hear, not me.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I said a dumb bitch no...bitch maybe...depends on what kind of bull you\n&gt; are trying to pass off as documented research. So here Karen Stollznow this\n&gt; is for you just because I know you liked my previous post to you enough that\n&gt; your felt it resorted to name calling. Which shows me exactly what kind of\n&gt; person you are and what state of mind you are in.\n&gt;\n&gt; POSTED FROM MY PREVIOUS MESSAGE TO THIS GROUP WHICH INSPIRED HER TO CALL ME\n&gt; A NAME. WOW I WAS ACTUALLY BEING PRETTY NICE WHEN I POSTED IT.\n&gt;\n&gt; _____BEGIN QUOTE_____\n&gt; Karen obviously does not research before she writes her articles.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;However, the precise location of the Sanatorium is a closely guarded\n&gt; secret.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ummm Karen needs to learn to use Google as well. If she had she would have\n&gt; been able to print out a map to Waverly which includes information such as\n&gt; tracks, businesses, adresses AND golf courses at the corner. It even shows\n&gt; you an overhead view of each building you pass along the way on each street.\n&gt; Hint to Karen click sattelite view after you explore closeups of map view.\n&gt;\n&gt; Im sorry but if you are going to write a well informed article the first\n&gt; step is become well informed. I wont bother reading the rest of her articles\n&gt; because I wont waste my time looking at research from someone who cant\n&gt; bother to cover the basics like look at a map before you drive out to\n&gt; someplace you&#39;ve never been before and then misinform people that it is in a\n&gt; secret location. Nor do I see walking on a tour as as actual &quot;investigation&quot;\n&gt; .\n&gt;\n&gt; Alot of the people once believed the earth was flat, unfortunately they\n&gt; were not &quot;well informed&quot; and they too were victims of shoddy research.\n&gt; Luckily there are those who do look beyond the horizon and open their minds\n&gt; to the possibility that there is more out there.\n&gt; _____END QUOTE______\n&gt;\n&gt; You also may want to check the website of the place before you visit, as\n&gt; you will see they also give directions to their establishment on there. I am\n&gt; sorry I wont waste my time reading any more of this wannabe &quot;researcher&quot;\n&gt; articles. I would rather spend my time actually learning something.\n&gt;\n&gt; Have a great day Karen and just remember if you are going to open your\n&gt; mouth and insert foot, it&#39;s always a good idea to scrape the crap off it\n&gt; first!\n&gt;\n&gt; Love and Light\n&gt; Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Zack Widup\n&gt; &lt;w9sz.zack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Someone&#39;s been spying on this group:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/franks_box_the_broken_radio/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Zack\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nTHAT'S JUST FUNNY !!!!!!!!!!On Thu, Jan 28, 2010 a 11:45 PM, bulle babea bulle babea@...> w o e:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÂ \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n LOL \n\nNo one needs o spy o ge he in o ma ion he e.
