I personally don&#39;t like \nto focus on evil entities, even though I believe 100% that lower \nastrals exist. Not only that, Tibetan shamans, among others, have \nrepeatedly shown that thought forms can be given form and a measure \nof life. The way I see it, if we keep a higher focus, such things as \nrage, hate, and destruction among other things will be far removed. \nOuija Boards have many times been the source of horrible experiences. \nJust from listening to all the hundreds of callers on C2C over the \nyears, I&#39;d say over 95% of the stories weren&#39;t good. George did make \na good statement to the effect that it&#39;s not good giving a loaded gun \nto a child.

Maybe he&#39;ll tell us why himself, if he \nchooses, since he&#39;s a list member.&gt; &gt; Can I ask you what personal \nexperiences you have had with evil entities that make you so \nconcerned? Not other people&#39;s alledged experiences, but your own? I&#39;m \nreally curious. It&#39;s not a trap of any kind.&gt; &gt; Ann&gt; &gt; -----Original \nMessage-----&gt; &gt;From: babiarz3 &lt;babiarz3@&gt;&gt; &gt;Sent: Dec 3, 2007 6:35 \nAM&gt; &gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: MiniBox - \nGeneral Recommendations&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Not misinformation.

Do not \nallow children under the age of 16 to use this device&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2. \nAlthough individual sessions are effective, group sessions are more&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; productive.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3. This is not an &#39;electronic Ouija \nboard&#39; - no harm can come from&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; using it.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 4. Some \nvoices will use coarse language so be prepared for it.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 5. \nAlways use a recorder to tape all sessions&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 6. Keep a \nnotebook with the times and locations of your sessions.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; \n7. The MiniBox will call you by name so don&#39;t be startled by it.&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Lance&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Put your friends on the big screen with Windows Vista + Windows \nLive.\n&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/windows/shop/specialoffers.mspx?\nocid=TXT_TAGLM_CPC_MediaCtr_bigscreen_102007\n&gt;"}
