&gt;  
&gt; &#x27;Saint Germain is always associated with the color violet, the 
jewel amethyst, and the Maltese cross rendered in violet (usually 
the iron cross style cross patee version); he is also regarded as 
the &#x27;Chohan of the Seventh Ray&#x27;[13]  according to Theosophy, the 
Seven Rays are seven metaphysical principles that govern both 
individual souls and the unfolding of each 2,158 year long 
Astrological Age. Since according to Theosophy the next Astrological 
Age, the Age of Aquarius, will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) 
Ray (the Ray of Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes 
called &#x27;The Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius&#x27;. According to the 
Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain is &#x27;The God of Freedom for 
the Earth&#x27;.&#x27;
&gt;  
&gt;  Much to do with the Purple Princess, and the seven. I don&#x27;t mean 
to sell others short, I just get a different level, and find 
regular &quot;this your auntie&quot; type EVPs kinda useless. Mostly I don&#x27;t 
post every voice I get, just the ones that I thought was 
outstanding, but no one else hears.
