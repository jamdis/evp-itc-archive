<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The random mode on this box never worked, which i feel is a great 
feature.  I changed the antenna with a piece of 20 guage wire from work 
and now the random seems to work really well, i really don&#x27;t understand 
why.  This was my first session with the random on #27, let me know 
what you guys think.  I left it as raw of files i could.  There is a 
couple up for interpretation that i&#x27;m not really sure of and another 
that says &quot;He wants to see if it&#x27;s working&quot;.  I hear &quot;He wants to see&quot; 
very clearly and i personally hear &quot;if it&#x27;s working&quot;, but that may just 
be my mind wanting to hear that.  I&#x27;m only 2 min. in to this recording 
from this morning, but i have to get to work so i will post what i&#x27;ve 
got so far.
