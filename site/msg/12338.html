<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have found a few definitions of Seth (SET)  All correlating with
demonic.  This may be part of the reason it is coming through on more
than one machine



In Egyptian tradition, the god Seth or Set &quot;stands for the forces of
chaos and destruction, or energy misplaced. He was the manifestation
of Apep or Typhon, opposers of the power of light.&quot;

Set - An evil god of the night from Ancient Egypt.

Seth - The god of the Underworld from Ancient Egypt

&gt; best course of action at that point.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Well when my friend first started getting Seth she was also getting 08
&gt;&gt; &gt; a lot, as well as hot and fell coming through a lot.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Why would this being gravitate to various Ovilus&#x27;?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Has anyone got the word devil or the word graphines (whatever that
&gt;&gt; &gt; is)? I&#x27;ve had graphines come up many times, &quot;devil&quot; has come up once
&gt;&gt; &gt; and it was clear as could be but it really didn&#x27;t have any context.
&gt;&gt; Weird.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; - Hi Carol,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Everyone,I am old to the site but new to posting messages.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Things have been to busy around here
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I also have the Ovilus
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I heard the names Seth, Amuel,Larry(Demon),Merrick, Samuel, Mott,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Mel. I have the full name to the Seth person. He mentions several
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; things so detailed. He also said he was from 1508 he fell, pain,
&gt; hot,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Also his last name is Saxton or he is from the town of Saxton in
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; England?? He also said he was in my house behind me behind the
&gt; couch.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Have you been hearing the same words? I will try to post the
&gt; session
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; this weekend.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you Maritza
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a puck, and I have been getting the name Seth too. I also
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; have had
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my puck give words that are not on the list.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new here, but have been into paranormal research for 6
&gt; years
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; now.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am the type of person that never gets EVP voices with a
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; recorder so
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I thought I would experiment with things like the Frank&#x27;s
&gt; box and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ovilus. I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a
&gt; cemetery and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field where a church burned down many years ago. I can not
&gt; get too
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific without having people thinking I am making stuff up
&gt; but
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; time
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of
&gt; random
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved over
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started saying relevant words like cross and priest. The Ovilus
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; was
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MUCH more active when being used by our female member. Towards
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the end
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me told
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Seth
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that she did not want to talk to you I&#x27;ve heard bad things
&gt; about
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; you.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; started
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Needless
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to say we ended the session and got out of there.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the course of our investigation we found that the
&gt; Ovilus was
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so
&gt; yesterday
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did some test recordings to see what words would come up and
&gt; one
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the first things that came up was: seth blamed rest I am
&gt; not
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gare demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I
&gt; am not
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; even
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the
&gt; ovilus
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying this.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; aren&#x27;t on
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the list,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Barry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words
&gt; he is
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; getting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger list
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; than
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My most important question is is anyone else getting the name
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Seth out
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; To Carol B.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would turn the the olivus on and then ask your spirit guide to tell
&gt;&gt; seth to leave. Seth needs to go back to his side, sounds like he is
&gt;&gt; trapped on your side with the olivus. If you haven&#x27;t already always
&gt;&gt; start a session with asking for protection. I am not sure what you
&gt;&gt; would say if you do not have a spirit guide that you know of. Someone
&gt;&gt; on this board or the other yahoo board recently posted a file that
&gt;&gt; address the protection issue. As ALWAYS ask the spirits to go back to
&gt;&gt; there side before you close a session. I always try to confirm with my
&gt;&gt; spirit guide/tech before shutting down. I address my guide directly to
&gt;&gt; send all the spirits back(she knows how to do it real good). Being
&gt;&gt; skeptical will not help you if you have a undesirable spirit hanging
&gt;&gt; around. Ask your guide to specifically never let seth in again.
