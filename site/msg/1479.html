&gt;Hi Misty, thank you for your post. I will upload some files. There
&gt;have been interesting sessions with how the Boxes address people by
&gt;name. And now that it&#x27;s happening to Steve it seems like this is part
&gt;of the phenomena of the Box that is repeatable and observed by
&gt;others. -Bill

&gt; &gt; Bill said something that had me thinking. He mentioned that when he
&gt;first got his box it called Franks name repeatedly. That isnt the
&gt;first time I saw someone say that. I know quite a few of you now have
&gt;been given a box or even constructed your own versions like Steve
&gt;based on the work Frank did.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   I have heard a couple of peoples results here but I would like to
&gt;hear more so I am going to ask if you have one you comment on your
&gt;use of it and how you think the results went as well as maybe post a
&gt;few sound files that I can hear. I have spent years listening to the
&gt;box voices but its refreshing to hear others results and see the
&gt;variations as with any other evp method, it differs by user/location.
&gt;LOL you know who you are and I wont name you all but I do hope you
&gt;will share with us.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   Thanks!
&gt; &gt;   Misty
