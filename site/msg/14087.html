Thank you Kristin, I have the Skype account  some where on here, watched 
o=
ne of those shows about that "Now" book writer,  Tolle  with Opera I think =
it 
was last year.  Right now I am waiting  until Radio Shack guy gets in h=
is 
wireless cards so, I can get the Alltel  wireless on my PC.  For the pa=
st 3 
years I've had a Satellite  service because I live in the woods.   AT=
T does 
not have DSL out  here yet for the dial up, and probably never will=
, close as 
they come with DSL  is half mile away behind me in town.  So, f=
or now I am 
still  stuck with the analog phone line for the PC, since my S=
atellite was  
acting up so bad  I recently just discontinued them, they wa=
nted to charge  
me to come out here, and fix their equipment, it hasn't be=
en working right 
for  over a year now, and my contract with them has been =
over with for over 2 
years,  and I really didn't want to sign back up with=
 them.
 
The wireless company has a huge tower right  across the road on to=
p of this 
hill here so, I should be able to get good  reception.  I got to=
 send my 
little 12- 125 radio out to someone  on the list to "hack" for me=
.   Gee,  if 
only the Radio Shack  people knew that their little RS-12-470=
 dynamo were 
actually good for something,  they would probably turn them o=
ut like hot 
cakes, eh?  They actually got  bad reviews from people buying =
them,  customers  
claimed the battery  life, and reception in them was poo=
r, lol so RS 
discontinued making them due to  the bad reviews.
 
As for Re=
v. L Lee, she's probably having too  much fun over there to be 
wanting to =
chat with me.  In life her voice was  very soft and light to hear 
normally=
, except when a spirit took  her body  over, then her voice changed to 
be =
like whomever was speaking through her at the  time, be it a man or a 
woma=
n.   I was a real sceptic,  so the  only way I know her to have been legit =

is because they had to prove it to me,  and they sure did.  It was not 
al=
ways the same person that came through her  either, like some of the phoney=
's 
out there today, she was the real McCoy, she  was not out for glory, sh=
e 
wasn't out to make any money, in the 30's they had  standing room only, =
on 
Sunday, and they had people clear out the doors of that  Church, before=
 she died 
though, there were only a handful of people, 11 people  left sti=
ll living, 
all the other member's died off, and after she died, her  Sermo=
ns were 
played for a few years, (btw, every single Sermon taped on the old=
  Real to Real 
over 2500 of them, were given by direct voice from some spi=
rit from  the 
other side).  She would start out with one small KJ verse an=
y where in  the 
Bible, and they took over a second later, and would make a=
  half hour Sermon 
from that one tiny Scripture verse.
 
After she died, p=
eople in that Church getting  elderly themselves died off 
as well, her son=
 sold the Church building for I  think a dollar to another 
group, it was a=
 huge old, old dark stone  beautiful building, been around for 
over 100 ye=
ars back then,  there was a  huge colored glass window of 
Michael the arc =
angel with an inscription that  reads as follows, "In enlarging 
paradise, =
lives a life that never dies,  when ye come where I have stepped  ye 
will =
wonder why ye wept," and they  donated that Window to the Detroit 
Institut=
e of Art's Museum down  state which is still there to this day.   I 
guess =
I was just  privileged to have known them, and got to be a part of the 
who=
le experience so,  I know beyond any doubt there is life after death, and 
=
one does  not need to even have faith when one knows something.
 
This tiny=
 5 foot lady Rev. Lee never missed a  Sunday for the 60 years she 
was ther=
e, she with a pace maker for over 30 years,  angina, could barely 
stand fo=
r very long, but when she got up there to give her  talk, no paper was 
eve=
r used, she never studied a thing, read her Sermon's, they  had no 
paper, =
only an open KJ Bible in front of her, one minute later, she had  some 
spi=
rit from over there take her body over, I don't know how, they just did,  
=
and she had energy, she could stand unassisted, move around, everything, it=
 
was  like she had become young again, this is a lady that had been in a c=
ar 
accident,  a bad heart, she was almost 86 years old, it is unreal what =
these 
spirit's are  able to do when they are on a mission.  It's like noth=
ing can 
stop them,  the only money the Church got was via a collection pla=
te, and 
from the  collection, they could barely heat the place, most peopl=
e put in a 
dollar of  two, or a few coins, she never, never asked for mone=
y,  they had a 
Sunday  service one in morning, and after noon class, and t=
he evening 
Service.  On  Wednesday people could come to her house if they =
wanted for a prayer 
meeting,  Thursday at her home she had a class, I'm te=
lling this because 
she did this  without making any money for it all.  Peo=
ple could give 
donation's if they  wanted, but she never pressed anyone fo=
r money.   Spirit used to 
say,  " a baby must first be given baby food, no=
t steak because they can't  
digest  it" I guess, a person can't be told so=
mething before they  are 
ready so maybe this is why we human's were not al=
lowed to know certain  things.  
Sorry to take up your time with this, but =
I just wanted to tell  you more 
about her, she told me that over there a p=
erson that dies when they are  old 
can appear young if they want, sometime=
s though to be recognized by people  
still living on Earth they appear mat=
erialize like they were last  known to

 list, and by now you are all  thinking 
me to be a fruit loop or something=

of the belief t=

work here.  
I=
 see you were  offered a used Mini Box from LK (Ghuny) on the other board. =

 Boxes are  passed from one researcher to another all the time without any=
 
problems so if  you have the financial ability I say go for it!  (BTW.. o=
nly 
Frank=E2=80=99s Boxes are called Frank=E2=80=99s  Boxes.  The Paranorm=
al System=E2=80=99s boxes

them all  straightJ).  Once a  transf=

box will usually will speak  about=
 the exchange..  and they usually work 
great for the new  owner. 
But sinc=
e you already  own the 125 Hack why not give that a go for a bit.  
Getting=
 it hacked is  a pretty simple process and I am happy that you have 
someon=
e to do it for  you.  When I first started I went and bought all these 
cab=

Br=
uce  straightened me out and said =E2=80=98hack the radio =E2=80=93 turn on=
 your handheld 
recorder  =E2=80=93 turn on your radio (with speaker if nee=

a Hack  in one hand and a recorder in ano=
ther and I was off.  It was and 
still is  a very simple process with no ne=

makes  it a very mobile process and I =
am able to walk around to find the 
best  location for reception.  My recor=
der attaches directly into my computer=E2=80=99s 
 USB port so I don=E2=80=
=99t even need a wire to connect that to download my audio 
into  my softwa=
re.  But if your recorder does needs a wire that is still 
just a  simple U=
SB cable between the recorder and the computer. And as Margaret 
 suggested=
 if you have a microphone on your computer then you can do your  
sessions =
in front of your computer and record directly and not have to 
upload  anyt=
hing.  I personally need the  mobility because reception is poor 
where I l=
ive and walking around to find the  best spot works for me=E2=80=A6  
I use=
 Goldwave Audio  Software but Audacity is free online shareware and it 
is =
quite good too.   If you would like a copy of Goldwave I can get it to 
you=
 (I have shared the  .exe file with several others.)  All you need is a 
SK=
YPE account because  it allows the exchange of .exe files.  Let me know.   =

You are such a  wonderful addition to our growing family.  You have been

dealing with  spirit for what.. 40 years at least (since the late 60s?)!  I=
 
look  forward to learning much from you and to hearing your first audio c=

  I bet your Rev Lee friend is just biting  at the bit for you to ge=

I am not familiar  with Anabella's work, just happened upon th=

without 
hacking, but there is not much  sound coming from it, the only way=
 to hear anything
